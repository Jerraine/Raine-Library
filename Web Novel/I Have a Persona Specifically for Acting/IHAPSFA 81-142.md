# Chapter81
All eyes were focused on Director Shi, waiting for his evaluation.
 

 
“If we only discuss Tong Zhao's second audition, you’ll notice that her posture was much lower than in the first audition. Here, 'lower' doesn’t mean humble; it means she was more willing to listen to other characters and wanted to understand them. During both auditions, Cheng Siwen reminded Tong Zhao that the villain was Fu Xuancheng…”
 

 
“In the first audition, Tong Zhao was obviously wary of him. She and the other characters were in a binary opposition; you could see that she was confrontational with everyone, but she took good care of Cheng Siwen, who obeyed her.” Director Shi pulled up a short clip where Duan Ge signaled for him to go to the back with his eyes, actually using himself to block the gaze that others were directing at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
“However, in the second audition, aside from her initially asserting her strength and boundaries, her communication with the other supporting characters was very open and inclusive throughout.”
 

 
Director Shi paused for a moment, coming up with a nickname for her: “The Plum Blossom Swordsman is very resistant to Tong Zhao One but feels a sense of familiarity with Tong Zhao Two. He is even willing to share a lot of information with her that he didn’t mention in the first audition.”
 

 
To direct a good film in the era of instinctive cinema, one must understand human nature very well and possess keen observational skills.
 

 
Because it captures the truest reactions, it's akin to temporarily holding the power of God.
 

 
“It's incredible that the same person can express so many different facets.”
 

 
“I prefer Tong Zhao One; she’s powerful. Whether you give her a saber or a sword, it should work well.”
 

 
“Just watch 'Heartless Tribulation,' and you’ll see that Tong Zhao is, in my mind, the most suitable woman to wield a sword—bar none.”
 

 
It was during this discussion that the team realized there were hidden fans of Tong Zhao among them.
 

 
As the auditions concluded, the other supporting actors gradually woke up and entered the room. Seeing everyone so engrossed in conversation, Tang Yanhao, who played Cheng Siwen, curiously asked, “How did I perform just now?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The audition room fell into silence as if someone had pressed the mute button.
 

 
He immediately grew anxious: “Did I mess up my performance?”
 

 
“No, you didn’t mess up,” the screenwriter said sympathetically as he put a hand on his shoulder, “You were overshadowed…”
 

 
As soon as Tang Yanhao entered, everyone suddenly realized that all they could remember was Tong Zhao, and the focus during the audition had been entirely on her… In "The Knives of the Maiden," Xie Guiya is undoubtedly the main character, but Cheng Siwen is also an important supporting character throughout the film, and in the earlier audition, this sunny and handsome boy was quite charming.
 

 
On screen, Tong Zhao was like a vortex, drawing the audience’s attention.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Was it her beautiful face? Cheng Siwen was also a handsome guy!
 

 
The director commented, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious gives her a stronger dramatic presence; you always feel like she’ll create some kind of commotion. It’s very dramatic.”
 

 
Using terms like “drama queen” or “overly dramatic” can carry slightly negative connotations.
 

 
So in the end, he chose a commonly used foreign adjective.
 

 
The people present were indeed elites in the instinctive film industry. Even if they didn’t know the source of Tong Zhao’s charm, they had indirectly guessed it—because her personality was born out of the experiences from her quick-changing roles; she was living a life that was anything but ordinary, and her subconscious could constantly provide dramatic expressions.
 

 
Director Shi looked thoughtfully at the two screens displaying Tong Zhao in different outfits.
 

 
“It’s difficult to evaluate as a whole, but I have a bold idea.”
 

 
Although Director Shi was not young, he had always been daring in innovation within the industry.
 

 
Despite the fact that he could easily make money by filming straightforward martial arts movies, he still chose to challenge himself by incorporating new elements that had rarely been explored before. Upon hearing this, everyone cast curious glances at him, while only the screenwriter nervously asked, “So, does that mean we need to change the script?”
 

 
“It’s unrelated to the script. I need to discuss it with the director.”
 

 
The screenwriter visibly relaxed upon hearing this.
 

 
As long as there was no need to change the script!
 

 
After Director Shi finished speaking, he delegated a few miscellaneous tasks and left the audition room with the director. As they walked, their voices were not loud, but they didn’t avoid being heard by others. Consequently, some gossipers perked up their ears, and passersby in the hallway caught fragments of their conversation—
 

 
“... too extroverted, hard to rein in...”
 

 
“... not as good as the first time...”
 

 
“... there will be difficulties in filming... increased costs... subconscious changes...”
 

 
Eventually, the two entered the elevator.
 

 
Once the heavy metal elevator doors closed, silence fell, effectively cutting off the curious ears that had been listening in.
 

 
Director Shi had a bit of an accent, and when he got excited, his voice would increase in volume.
 

 
This was the content that all the gossipers intermittently caught; when pieced together, it seemed to convey that they were quite critical of Tong Zhao, suggesting that she was not as good as Qin Meizi, who had come for the audition the first time, and that they were criticizing the instability of Tong Zhao’s subconscious.
 

 
So that was it!
 

 
It seemed that despite Tong Zhao’s elaborate efforts to audition twice, she ultimately still failed.
 

 
Upon reaching this conclusion, everyone’s eyes sparkled with excitement as they couldn’t wait to share the “firsthand information” with their friends during the waiting period for notifications—
 

 
[That popular female celebrity really came to audition for Director Shi's new project, and the result was quite shocking.]
 

 
[She wasn’t selected, wasn’t selected. But that’s not the main point; the key is that she requested to audition for the same segment twice, saying she had two sides to her subconscious, possibly thinking that this would be eye-catching… somehow, maybe she wanted to score points in front of the director? But in the end, that was also why she wasn’t chosen.]
 

 
[It seems they felt she was not as good as Qin Yisi.]
 

 
[Exactly, actually Uncle Dingjun is very kind; he’s not as fierce as the outside world thinks. The instinctive film industry is also not as mysterious as outsiders imagine. I learned from Uncle Dingjun that even if you’re a celebrity, you shouldn’t get carried away by marketing hype and fans; you still need to be grounded. Having a diverse subconscious can bring too many disadvantages to filming, not to mention she’s so expensive.]
 

 
[I don’t know the exact price, but I heard Tong Zhao's current worth is this amount! ￥￥￥￥￥￥￥￥]
 

 
……
 

 
Such conversations quietly spread.
 

 
Those indulging in this gossip reveled in schadenfreude.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s path had been too smooth. The resources she started with weren’t even top-tier, yet within a year, she not only participated in the Li Zhi TV gala but also starred in the highly acclaimed and commercially successful film "Heartless Tribulation." While her fans were enjoying her success, her peers were filled with envy.
 

 
They didn’t consider themselves to be saints who could calmly watch their peers succeed; it was entirely normal to gossip and share rumors.
 

 
As for those without malice, they were individuals who could never compete with Tong Zhao, and since they had no grounds for envy, they merely felt pleased to flaunt their insider connections to friends, pretending to be well-informed and savvy—so-called “insiders.”
 

 
Such people are not uncommon; if one has a broad social circle, they can easily find such discussions in their friend group.
 

 
A shared photo, and in their words, “Isn’t that old X? We often hang out; if there’s a gathering, I’ll definitely be invited.” When a certain new movie is released, they express their feelings as if they shared an intimate friendship, while no one in their friend circle can truly validate the grandeur of their connections with that high-profile individual.
 

 
What happens when these people catch even a whiff of genuine gossip?
 

 
When they pry out even a morsel of real news from celebrities?
 

 
That’s something else.
 

 
Goodness, that could provide a year’s worth of conversation material.
 

 
From Shi Dingjun’s perspective, commenting on the recently pursued stars by film companies and directors, picking apart details, satisfied a portion of people’s hidden sense of superiority.
 

 
Shi Dingjun and the director were completely unaware of this.
 

 
After all, their original words were...
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 1 is a bit too extroverted and hard to rein in, you know? That kind of feeling makes the audience be unreasonably drawn to her, which is very useful during the film's climax, but if she stays like that throughout the entire film, it will be unbalanced. I’ve seen her in 'Countdown 72 Hours' and 'One Life Survivor,' and there are obvious structural issues in both; although 'Countdown' is labeled as a movie, it actually has a heavy component of live variety show.”
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 2 is not as indulgent as the first time; she’s much more restrained.”
 

 
—“Each version of Tong Zhao has particular points that fit perfectly with Xie Guiya. I want them all! I really want to film with her! However, doing so would pose difficulties in production and objectively increase costs; I wonder if her subconscious changes can remain stable…”
 

 
That disdain and frustration are the happy troubles of someone who is too good at everything.
 

 
It’s a kind of Versailles-style complaint.
 

 
After reaching a consensus with the director, he made a phone call to have Tong Zhao, who was drinking tea in the lounge, return to wait for the official filming to begin. He clearly expressed his thoughts, hoping she could cooperate with his immature concept: “Let’s put it this way, this lead role feels like it has to be you. I hope you can keep this schedule, but I’m also filming like this for the first time, which is quite risky. I can afford to lose, but you may not be able to. If you discuss it with your agent and feel it’s not worth the risk and want to decline, that’s perfectly fine.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun spoke candidly.
 

 
He was a renowned director, with his last two films being very successful; no one would deny his status in the film industry due to one less successful innovation. He could afford to be a graceful loser.
 

 
Tong Zhao was an emerging female star, and every filming opportunity was precious.
 

 
Moreover, in the eyes of others, Director Shi's high-budget productions were bound to be successful. If his film flopped, it would also affect her reputation among the public and within the industry.
 

 
In others' eyes, Shi Dingjun's films were indeed a hot commodity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had many choices now and really didn’t need to take this risk; even shooting a historical drama would be a safer option.
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment, then smiled:
 

 
“I like your idea, Director Shi. As long as you dare to offer me the role of Xie Guiya, I will dare to take it.”
 

 
One of her characteristics was her willingness to take risks.
 

 
The two clicked immediately.
 

 
Tong Zhao happily sat in the van back home. After connecting with two different personalities during the holographic film shoot today, she felt a bit fatigued from switching back and forth like changing tapes. So, she lit a soothing aromatherapy candle, wrapped herself tightly in a blanket on the sofa, and dozed off for a bit. As a result, the scent of the new ebony and bergamot aromatherapy candle was just to her liking, and she ended up sleeping until evening, her memories of the audition refreshed.
 

 
Shuyi: [Wow, Duan Ge is so fierce.]
 

 
Duan Ge: 【The plot requires it; didn’t you hit him too? You’ve probably beaten up people during interviews before.】
 

 
Shuyi once disguised herself to infiltrate a whaling base in the East. Due to carelessness, she was discovered and had to take down the three people who found her—but at the time, she had very handy weapons and equipment since she was prepared for danger when she infiltrated.
 

 
Shu Yi: [Isn’t it reasonable for a reporter who must deal with ruthless criminals to know a bit of self-defense?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Hmm, a little bit.]
 

 
The two exchanged a knowing smile.
 

 
As Tong Zhao groggily made her way to the bathroom to wash her face, she listened to their quiet conversation in her mind, feeling particularly good.
 

 
One of the reasons for her good mood was the brand-new interpretation method proposed by Director Shi, which she found quite appealing—
 

 
She recalled what Director Shi had said:
 

 
“Tong Zhao, you can steadily switch between two states, could you use your second audition self for the first half, and for the second half... I need the explosive power and commanding presence you presented to me in the first audition!”
# Chapter82
Tong Zhao was particularly happy.
 

 
“A movie means double the experience; once it's finished, Zhao Zai should be able to come out.”
 

 
Ever since her head got caught in the door last time, Zhao Zai had given up her curious behavior of peeking around. Instead, Concubine Chen often came to tease her, like someone playing with a little seal at the zoo. Lu Xianzhang felt sorry for Zhao Zai, thankful that during her time as a concubine, she had never had children; otherwise, she would likely have ended up as someone who was played with by her own mother to pass the time.
 

 
Zhao Zai said she would challenge Concubine Chen when she came out.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “Jump up and hit my knees? I’m so scared.”
 

 
Tong Zhao patted essence on her face.
 

 
In fact, these effects were not as good as her practice in cultivation. Even just sitting quietly for an hour to absorb the essence of heaven and earth had better results than any beauty treatment. It was just that she enjoyed having all those bottles and jars in her bathroom, and the thrill of buying skincare products in bulk when they were on sale.
 

 
After finishing her skincare routine, Tong Zhao lay back in her massage chair, preparing to check on Ze Shan’s work progress.
 

 
Everything was going smoothly.
 

 
“Little Lamb Playmate” was being launched into the market step by step according to her planned publicity strategy. The high costs originally set aside for celebrity endorsements had been redistributed to hire various game streamers and video content creators to produce embedded advertisements.
 

 
“Is the opposing team’s support taking down the Wild King? Come to ‘Little Lamb Playmate’! You can find any king here and even listen to voice lines.”
 

 
In the gaming lobby, seeking help from the Wild King? By spending money on “Little Lamb Playmate,” you could enjoy the thrill of selecting a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao instructed that the app’s categories be more detailed; not only should the ranks be differentiated, but they could also be specified down to hero names as keywords—like if a boss wanted to learn to play the hero Yun Zhongjun, they could simply look for a top player specializing in Yun Zhongjun’s skills, ensuring they wouldn’t lead novices astray.
 

 
By the time others noticed the business opportunities in this field, it was already too late.
 

 
The players established fixed relationships with bosses in “Little Lamb Playmate,” and users were accustomed to spending money there.
 

 
Just this “habit” was worth its weight in gold.
 

 
Being the first to take the plunge had its advantages.
 

 
Tong Zhao calculated her earnings from “Little Lamb Playmate” and, satisfied, closed the app. She also reminded Wei Zekai: “Remember to prohibit any offline transactions and never arrange offline meetings through the app. Although many users want a local function, it’s too risky to open that up. If they want a casual encounter, they should find their partners in the private spaces instead of through our application.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Okay.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “What does blind box have to do with this?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “... It’s like instant local matchmaking; you add each other in the morning and meet in the afternoon without knowing what the other person looks like. That’s why it’s called a blind box.”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked shocked.
 

 
He had gained some useless knowledge.
 

 
Not really liking this method, he thought about what he wanted to say the most today: “By the way, a momentary failure doesn’t mean anything; you are the best.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I will always firmly choose you!”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If you don’t want to talk about this, I won’t say anything more. But I hope Tong Zhao knows that each of us at Ze Shan is your solid support, especially me.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Music Link: My Good Brother - Xiao Shenyang & Gao Jin]”
 

 
Tong Zhao accidentally clicked on the link, and the song began to play.
 

 
‘My good brother, if you have troubles, you tell me. When you need me, I will accompany you through it together.’ [Note]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “……… ”
 

 
She didn’t know what was wrong with this guy.
 

 
Just as she was about to ask, her manager called, telling her not to pay attention to the rumors outside and that the next opportunity would be even better.
 

 
Ten minutes earlier, Tong Zhao had felt quite pleased with herself.
 

 
Ten minutes later, her good friend and manager sent her comforting messages.
 

 
This left Tong Zhao puzzled.
 

 
But this wasn’t the first time; she clearly felt she was quite impervious to attacks, yet those around her seemed to feel distressed even when she bumped into something.
 

 
“First, explain what the outside rumors are about.”
 

 
“They said that you mentioned your subconscious has various forms and wanted to showcase them separately to Director Shi. Wasting two audition opportunities and still getting rejected, some things were said quite harshly. They said it’s ridiculous that you treat your unstable, distorted subconscious as a selling point in front of a big director. They won’t increase costs because of your instability; you really think too highly of yourself.”
 

 
Sister Chu paused and then comforted her, saying, “It’s just jealousy. Those who have achieved more than you and are currently more famous certainly wouldn’t think that way.”
 

 
However, Tong Zhao held the opposite view:
 

 
“If they really didn’t think that way, then the entertainment industry wouldn’t have the term ‘bomb-proof’.”
 

 
The cake is only so big.
 

 
If she gets a role, it inevitably means someone else loses a role.
 

 
Actors with subconscious-driven film roles generally have more rigid paths and typically only compete with similar types.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was an outlier; anyone could be threatened by her.
 

 
Right now, everything she acted in became a hit; no one wanted to clash with her ratings. As long as she expressed interest in acting… even if it was just a script without a production team, there would be investors willing to back her. What couldn’t be accomplished with money? Aside from directors of Director Shi’s caliber, there were plenty of directors wanting to collaborate with Tong Zhao. Shi Qianqiu was just sitting there and doing nothing, saying he didn’t want to shoot a new movie for the time being—unless Tong Zhao acted in it.
 

 
Sister Chu: “You have a point.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Others are fine with just one bowl of rice; you want to set a banquet at home.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed at this description.
 

 
Isn’t that right? She could indeed host a grand feast in her mind.
 

 
After laughing, Tong Zhao collected herself and said, “The main issue is that they got it wrong from the beginning. Where did they hear such false news? Director Shi has already settled on me. However, the increased costs need to be discussed with the investors. He was very confident in his tone, saying he has some influence with the investors and asked me to give him two days. He will definitely give me a response by Sunday.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s time was precious; she wouldn’t get stuck on a single project.
 

 
So, waiting two days was also a matter of giving Director Shi face.
 

 
Sister Chu felt happy for her after hearing this, but she was also puzzled—how did this rumor spread?
 

 
This was easy to investigate.
 

 
After all, a group of people were vividly claiming that they had personally heard Director Shi say it.
 

 
As it circulated, the final version morphed into a sensational story about how “the domineering little flower wanted to show off in front of the veteran director but ended up being eliminated instead,” which was very satisfying for those who spread it.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a phone call to ask the director himself. Director Shi was baffled, denied the rumors three times, and then told her the original words. He didn’t think she was making a big deal out of it; instead, he comforted her: “Stability in the subconscious is important. If this were your first performance, I might be worried, but your past performances have been so stable that I don’t need to worry at all! The audition effect you presented to me is worth the risk. You’re still young and new in the industry; too many people are envious of you. Such talk is normal, just wait for the official announcement.”
 

 
Director Shi had a good impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Moreover, since his master was quite fond of her, they might even have a future as fellow disciples, so he naturally was willing to say a few more words.
 

 
“By the way, do you have time the night after tomorrow? My master’s birthday is being celebrated at Ming Yun Restaurant, and I’d like to invite you to dinner. But it’s in Qin City… If you come, I will arrange for someone to pick you up.”
 

 
Taking the opportunity, Director Shi extended the invitation.
 

 
Tong Zhao checked her schedule; she had nothing planned for that day, so it would be a good chance to visit Qin City.
 

 
While enjoying peace and rest at home was nice, she also needed to get out and about.
 

 
One of the benefits of her quick-wear experiences was that she had endless energy and initiative. She didn’t need others to tell her what to do, nor did she require prompting; she would take the initiative to get things done and would find tasks to occupy herself with if there was nothing to do—she simply couldn’t sit still. Sister Chu often joked that among the artists she managed, Zhao Zhao was the one who needed the least coaxing. When the schedule was set, and she called to confirm, the answer she always received was full of energy, along with a readiness to go out at any time.
 

 
That’s why she was the most cherished by her.
 

 
“Okay, then I’ll see you the night after tomorrow.”
 

 
Once Tong Zhao settled this, she told Sister Chu not to schedule any other work for her in the meantime.
 

 
She also sent a message to that overly worried guy: “Don’t overthink it; I wasn’t eliminated. The role is mine now.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “ [Surprised expression of the host holding open their eyelids with two fingers.jpg]”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Snape clapping meme.jpg]”
 

 
…This guy's collection of memes was truly unfathomable.
 

 
After hanging up, Sister Chu suddenly realized something was off. The old curator’s birthday?
 

 
She checked, and historically, the old curator's birthday was a star-studded event, especially for those who had acted in action films. No one would dare to offend him. However, in the past, it had never been grand; he only invited his disciples and familiar faces. This year marked his sixtieth birthday, and they were preparing for a big celebration at Ming Yun Restaurant.
 

 
Ming Yun Restaurant was also a prestigious place.
 

 
It was the highest-rated restaurant in Qin City, and many celebrities and wealthy businessmen chose to host banquets on the top three floors.
 

 
It wasn’t just a simple birthday celebration for a friend!
 

 
Sister Chu was speechless and more anxious than Tong Zhao herself. She hurriedly booked the best stylist and formal wear she could find on short notice, determined to dress her up beautifully. There would be reporters and other film stars on site, and once the photos hit the streets, who would dare say Director Shi looked down on her?
 

 
Tong Zhao was clearly informed about the arrangements, while her manager was already starting to take out loans to prove a point.
 

 
She didn’t feel much about it; her manager said, “If they can mock with loans, why can’t I enjoy myself with one? They talk as if it’s true; Director Shi is on good terms with our Zhao Zhao!”
 

 
Tong Zhao found this line of reasoning a bit strange.
 

 
But it was no wonder Sister Chu was angry. The confidentiality of the auditions that day was not very high, and once rumors started circulating, they spread like wildfire. Some were screenshot and shared within small circles of friends, eventually landing in the hands of marketing accounts, presented as half-truths.
 

 
@Guajie Breaks the News:
 

 
Guess who this female star is?
 

 
[Content of the screenshot from the Moments: “I can’t help but say this is too funny ! When I went to the audition today, I encountered Director Shi auditioning for ‘The Knives of the Maiden' and overheard a scoop… A certain female star who debuted a year ago claimed her subconscious was very special and wanted two audition chances. In the end, she didn’t make it after trying twice . The director and the supervisor said she was too unstable, which would increase costs.”]
 

 
Comments on Moments:
 

 
“Really? Who is it?”
 

 
Reply: “TZ (in a low voice)”
 

 
“Wow, didn’t she say she rejected a lot of scripts? Is she just waiting for this one? It’s so unfortunate to be eliminated.”
 

 
Reply: “I think the director doesn’t like her being too dramatic. If she had auditioned well, maybe she’d still have a chance.”
 

 
These snarky screenshots from Moments were like water hitting a hot oil pan; they exploded.
 

 
It was too easy to guess.
 

 
The points about being in the industry for a year and subconsciousness, coupled with the initials, were practically the same as naming her outright.
 

 
[TZ can only be Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[It’s normal to fail an audition once; is it necessary to be so sarcastic? She didn’t use this to promote herself.]
 

 
[Can’t her fans just stop being so smug?]
 

 
[Hmm, it’s probably because saying the truth sounds like bragging; a niche reality show blew up, and a leading lady film broke records on its opening day, but now she’s being buried in the ground after one failed audition… I’m just speaking the truth for some jealous folks; no need to thank me!]
 

 
In the entertainment industry, whether fans or haters, everyone was a super big gossip monger.
 

 
The comments and shares became chaotic, and occasionally an uninformed bystander would wander in, noticing countless mentions of the name in the hot comments, yet there were still people asking—
 

 
[Who are you all talking about? Why do you all look like you know what's going on?]
 

 
Good grief, they’re jumping from Bilibili to Weibo, wanting the gossip served to them on a platter, even saving the effort of chewing.
 

 
Bystanders are just enjoying the show, while fans are genuinely invested.
 

 
The battle between fans and haters in the comments of this Weibo post, coupled with Tong Zhao's increased fame following the Li Zhi TV gala, has led many to pay attention to what role she would take next. Fans were eagerly looking forward to her breaking new records, but instead, they got the news that she turned down many scripts and failed auditions, which must have been disappointing.
 

 
If it were just a private disappointment, that would be one thing.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao had only debuted for a short while, her foundation was solid, and among her fanbase, many top-tier fans wouldn't just run away after a small setback.
 

 
However, being exposed to the sunlight felt entirely different.
 

 
But thinking about it, with Tong Zhao’s current popularity, it was impossible for her to just quietly fade away. Countless pairs of eyes were watching her; if she stumbled, people would gather around to share the news, loudly announcing to the entire fan community: Tong—Zhao—has—fallen!
 

 
After a day of noise, no serious figure had stepped up to speak out.
 

 
That made sense, though; during auditions, there were too many voices. When it came time to decide who would play the lead role, it was a discussion between higher-ups and investors, and irrelevant people couldn't possibly hear it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious and wanted to post on Weibo to throw down the gauntlet.
 

 
Wasn’t it just arguing?
 

 
Although he wasn’t good at being sarcastic, he was still a seasoned gamer from Zu'an, capable of handling pressure and taking the blame like a veteran!
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped him: "If you step out, people really won’t care about my audition anymore; they’ll just think I've been officially announced."
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t understand: "Isn’t an official announcement a good thing? Didn’t Director Shi book you?"
 

 
"It's not about the movie announcement,"
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed: "It's about our relationship being announced."
 

 
This statement successfully stopped Wei Zekai’s impulsive behavior.
 

 
A day later, an entertainment news piece was released by Sina Entertainment.
 

 
“Tong Zhao Appears at Director Deng’s 60th Birthday Banquet”
 

 
Subsequently, many credible entertainment accounts released:
 

 
“Director Shi and Tong Zhao Enjoy a Happy Conversation? Mrs. Shi: A particularly spirited young girl.”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s simple yet elegant appearance stuns everyone; Director Shi clarifies the rumors.”
 

 
“Official Announcement of the Female Lead in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’!”
 

 
The agent, who had been holding in a surge of anger, especially used her connections this time to ensure a photographer at the event took a flattering picture of Tong Zhao—this was incredibly easy for reporters, as Tong Zhao was already a somewhat famous beauty in the industry with no bad angles. It would take a lot of effort and skill to get a bad photo of her; they would need to amp up their techniques to get even an average shot.
 

 
In short, each piece of news was tacitly accompanied by a photo of Tong Zhao sitting next to the old director and his wife, surrounded by her senior brothers and sisters. She wore an elegant gray gown adorned with eagle feathers, her long hair styled up, revealing her graceful swan neck and beautifully defined shoulders...
 

 
Sister Chu put in a lot of effort; she certainly wouldn’t let her agent's hard work go to waste.
 

 
Throughout the event, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of a regal beauty, successfully capturing a multitude of camera shots.
 

 
Once the news broke...
 

 
It was as if the haters who had been shouting, “Can you beat my 17 cards?” were suddenly swept away by a massive bomb and a plane, all accompanied by joyful sounds of a suona!
# Chapter83
What on earth is going on?
 

 
Forget about the haters and bystanders; even the fans, who should have first-hand information, are at a loss and can only rush to share in the fan groups, hoping to get clarification from the fans with better sources.
 

 
Both the fans and the haters are confused.
 

 
Many of the well-informed fans and studio leaders collaborate with entertainment companies, achieving mutual benefits and collectively reaping profits, aiming for a goal of shared prosperity.
 

 
Tong Zhao's contract with the company is quite flexible. She has also emphasized to her manager that she does not want to follow the idol route, so her fans naturally formed on their own without the need for deliberate cultivation—
 

 
Thus, Tong Zhao's fan base has a relatively average fighting capacity.
 

 
Unless provoked by someone else, they will never rush to respond.
 

 
Some in the fandom feel that Tong Zhao's camp lacks the right atmosphere and doesn’t have that sought-after flavor of the domestic entertainment industry. However, Tong Zhao's fandom is also one of the more comfortable ones for outsiders to support, as they don’t focus rigidly on album sales or engage in various messy voting schemes, while also dabbling in other fields that occasionally surprise fans.
 

 
With pros come cons, and Tong Zhao is quite satisfied with the current state of affairs.
 

 
Overall, it’s just fine. She isn’t planning a rebellion or preparing private troops, nor does she want to be the leader of a crab cult that unifies the world for generations.
 

 
During the fans' period of confusion, they noticed that Director Shi followed Tong Zhao—
 

 
@Shi Dingjunv:
 

 
"Welcome the lead actress of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and our little junior sister @Tong Zhao!"
 

 
[Audition Screenshot 1.JPG][Audition Screenshot 2.JPG]
 

 
……
 

 
[So she really became a junior sister? Congratulations to Director Shi.]
 

 
[Oh my gosh, a plot twist??? So the marketing accounts were spreading fake news??? @Guajie, come out and get beaten up.]
 

 
[Wasn’t it said that she had high aspirations and used her unique subconscious as a gimmick, and that she got scolded by you??? How did she turn around??? Did she ultimately bow to capital???]
 

 
This is a suggestion that Tong Zhao has capital backing her.
 

 
Even though she had publicly distanced herself from the Tong family long ago and retained her surname simply because it shares a character with her mother’s, she had also cut ties with Tong Zhenming and had a reputation that was not merely damaged, but practically shattered. If she wasn’t stepped on, it would be a stroke of luck; how could anyone help her? But she also has a wealthy and unattainable rumored boyfriend, Wei Zekai, along with the entertainment company behind her.
 

 
Conspiracy theories never go out of style.
 

 
There are no absolutes in this world; from another perspective, it’s a good thing for the public to remain vigilant.
 

 
Shi Dingjun responded directly to this comment: "After the audition, I planned to finalize Tong Zhao. However, because we intended to use a special filming method, it would increase certain costs, so I needed to discuss it with the investors. They ultimately strongly supported my decision. I only heard about this rumor today; I was too busy preparing for the master’s birthday and the new movie... That rumor has been false since I first trained her; it’s all misinformation."
 

 
To increase his credibility, Shi Dingjun even posted a comment with a picture.
 

 
It was a record of his WeChat conversations with Tong Zhao, clearly showing that they added each other as friends on the morning of the audition. After the audition, they chatted for a bit, and the conversation was filled with appreciation. From the timing of their discussions, it was clear that any notion of capital pressure was nonexistent, and he liked Tong Zhao very much.
 

 
So where did the rumors come from?
 

 
Director Shi said it might have originated from the conversation he had with the supervisor after the audition. They both came from the same hometown and spoke a mix of dialect and Mandarin. Some people only understood part of the conversation and took it upon themselves to spread it as a serious rumor, which is quite unethical. He hopes the rumors can stop.
 

 
This blocked the last point of doubt.
 

 
Shi Dingjun has a great image, and his words carry weight more than anything else.
 

 
[It’s too funny to be a bystander during all this hhhhh]
 

 
[Got it, the end result of mocking with loans is getting slapped in the face.]
 

 
[A little bit of rumor-catching drew all the foolish haters out; I’d call it a skill.]
 

 
Fans who were previously anxious suddenly found their backbone.
 

 
In reality, being eliminated from the audition isn’t a big deal.
 

 
However, being publicly scolded by the well-liked and prominent Director Shi is quite an embarrassing black mark, and it’s likely to resurface in the future whenever there’s a dispute with other companies.
 

 
With the burden lifted, it’s time to settle accounts with the rumor mongers!
 

 
[Seriously, think about how awkward this is. How long have Director Shi and Tong Zhao known each other? If it were someone else, and there were all these rumors about that person badmouthing you behind your back, would you still consider them a friend? The rumor mongers have dirty hearts; I hope they get their mouths sewn shut in the future.]
 

 
The true source of the rumors is untraceable, but the origin of the sarcastic posts that really spread them is easy to find.
 

 
It was a minor role who didn’t leave after the audition that day, named Yun Zhiran. Her level of fame is only slightly different from that of a regular person; she had never landed an important role before, so just getting a minor role with lines in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ is a breakthrough for her.
 

 
Fans are itching to confront her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao first retweeted her thanks to Shi Dingjun and then posted a new Weibo update.
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
"I hope the audience can find joy in my work.
 

 
I hope my fans can draw positive energy from liking me; there’s no need to fight for me, and don’t hate or belittle others because of me. I will fight my own battles, and I will walk my own path. When I’m weary, you support me; when I’m weak, you encourage me; when I succeed, I can share it with you. That is enough."
 

 
This statement was calculated and well-considered.
 

 
Of course, fans need to be restrained. At the very least, she herself set the tone; even if they want to act out, it won’t be too outrageous. By nipping the signs of toxicity in the bud at the beginning, it can prevent things from spiraling out of control later—why are there so many instances of "bystanders wishing for her downfall, while fans wish nothing but for their idol to thrive"? Because short-sightedness for immediate gains set a bad precedent, and the fan groups that developed afterward resemble a high-speed car with malfunctioning brakes, completely out of control and impossible to rein in even by the idol herself.
 

 
Why not stop it?
 

 
Because the capital behind the idol has already earned its money, and there are very few young idols with the foresight and resources to reject toxic fan behavior from the start.
 

 
If you won’t support me, I’ll find someone else to lift up.
 

 
Why not support them?
 

 
After all, they’re just a fast-moving product that will only be popular for one or two years. If they lose control, they can just disappear from the entertainment industry with a fortune.
 

 
In this world, everyone is bustling for profit; the world is chaotic because of profit flowing away.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that her fans were excited, and it wouldn’t be good to harshly criticize them or pour cold water on their enthusiasm. So, she chose to give a more gentle hint, affirming the unwavering support her fans had shown her lately.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t afraid that her fans wouldn’t understand.
 

 
What is there for fans to misunderstand? Most people in the fandom have excellent reading comprehension skills.
 

 
[Got it, we won’t give our sister any trouble; good luck to her in her new drama! /Heart emoji [Tong Zhao cute expression pack.jpg]]
 

 
[Quietly waiting for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’; Sister looked so beautiful at the birthday banquet! [Edited high-quality photo.jpg]]
 

 
[We don’t spread hate / We’re cute, we also don’t belittle others / So happy, hope the rumor-mongering monsters stay away from our sister / Smile]
 

 
This sarcastic Weibo post and the three default expressions show the repressed anger of some of the more combative fans, warning certain competitors who can’t stand Tong Zhao’s success and bored haters to focus on their own happy lives and not bother them anymore.
 

 
After Tong Zhao posted on Weibo, she glanced at the comments, knowing it was enough that her mainstream fans had received her message.
 

 
After all, a celebrity's fanbase influences each other.
 

 
She found it quite interesting to look at the comments on her Weibo.
 

 
If only everyone would talk without constantly posting her photos, it’s a bit too brainwashing; she had become numb to it and was starting to lose the ability to discern her own beauty from ugliness.
 

 
After soothing her fans, Tong Zhao didn’t intend to suffer insults without reason.
 

 
She directly told Director Shi to remove Yun Zhiran from her role, with a ready-made justification—someone who spreads half-truths and rumors clearly has questionable character. Moreover, if she has such strong opinions about the lead, what if that hatred unconsciously affects her and leads to a big problem during filming, like stabbing the lead with a knife? A minor role can be easily swapped out.
 

 
The director’s reply was: “Actually, I was already planning to cut her anyway.”
 

 
After all, half of this rumor was pinned on him, which was quite unfair.
 

 
When Yun Zhiran received the news that she had been temporarily cut from the role, she was momentarily stunned. Putting together the current events, she guessed it had something to do with Tong Zhao—she believed that Director Shi wouldn’t hold a grudge against a young girl; it had to be a case of women making things difficult for each other. It was just like how she felt a sense of secret joy when she heard that Tong Zhao had “failed” the audition and was eager to have more people witness her downfall. Yun Zhiran managed to obtain Tong Zhao's work WeChat through some minor methods, hoping to apologize and plead for mercy.
 

 
When she saw Yun Zhiran send a long string of messages, Tong Zhao felt not a single ripple of emotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Firstly, I don’t have much say in casting decisions; changing actors is not my responsibility. I’m sorry you lost this role, but I don’t know much about the related matters. If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Then, she blacklisted Yun Zhiran.
 

 
Whether it was a phone call or WeChat, there was always a risk of being screenshot or recorded. Tong Zhao was in the right and wasn’t afraid of a dispute.
 

 
However, she didn’t plan to get entangled in endless disputes with a minor role; it would be too embarrassing. If this were a TV drama, this minor character would only be a brief interlude to adjust the pacing; wanting the lead to interact with them for three or four episodes? They’d need at least a top star for that!
 

 
Yun Zhiran felt a tightness in her chest from Tong Zhao’s last line: “If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Because she had mocked Tong Zhao in her social circle with the line, “It’s the director who doesn’t like her being too dramatic; if she auditions well, there might still be opportunities,” now that the same words were thrown back at her, Yun Zhiran felt like she was having a heart attack. Tong Zhao guessed correctly; she indeed wanted to argue with Tong Zhao. By stirring up controversy, she could gain heat and attention. Unfortunately, Tong Zhao didn’t fall for it and remained calm, which made her uncomfortable.
 

 
As she was about to say something, she received a red exclamation mark.
 

 
Yun Zhiran: “…?”
 

 
Did she just get blacklisted?
 

 
No rebuttal?
 

 
No insults?
 

 
Yun Zhiran had also mocked her on Weibo.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had previously stated not to engage in such antics, the fans who came to her defense were few, and passersby quickly forgot about it. After all, they weren't on the same level; they only knew that Tong Zhao quickly clarified the rumors against her and publicly showcased a great resource, gaining the endorsement of credible figures in the industry and maintaining an excellent image…
 

 
That bit of negative impact dissipated silently.
 

 
At that moment, the criticism Yun Zhiran faced was significantly smaller than the wave of collective mockery directed at Tong Zhao that had arisen after her rumors.
 

 
Spreading rumors felt good at the moment, but when the backlash came, she realized how painful it could be.
 

 
In an instant, Yun Zhiran understood.
 

 
This complete disregard from Tong Zhao truly made her uncomfortable—enjoying fabricating rumors behind someone’s back? That’s fine; just focus on being a rat in the gutter and don’t come prancing in front of her. She wasn’t worthy.
 

 
After Tong Zhao blacklisted Yun Zhiran, she completely removed that name from her mind.
 

 
Just a nobody.
 

 
What mattered more was her reputation.
 

 
This was something her agent and her company had been striving for—
 

 
They didn’t expect to mold Tong Zhao into a flawless person, but if the dirt thrown at the “Tong Zhao” brand was false, they needed to wash it away as much as possible. Fortunately, as Tong Zhao had said, there was no need to escalate it into a messy war of words… After being properly “soothed,” the fans’ anger significantly decreased, and the keywords in their comments shifted from aggressive terms like “rumor-mongering dogs,” “haters,” and “anti-explosion” to a focus on the new drama and Tong Zhao’s appearance at the curator’s birthday banquet.
 

 
Many people on Director Shi’s Weibo were asking what this new filming method that would increase costs was all about.
 

 
Director Shi smiled and said he had to keep it a secret for now.
 

 
But surely they could talk about Tong Zhao becoming their little junior sister?
 

 
Not only did Shi Dingjun generously mention it, but some videos from the birthday banquet also leaked, and many attendees proudly showcased it on Weibo. Sister Chu thought correctly; that night, many important figures from the film industry and political circles gathered, especially since the old curator had made significant contributions to martial arts in China. Those involved in this field had some historical connections; in short, it was no small matter.
 

 
Tong Zhao's careful preparation had not gone to waste.
 

 
Considering this wasn’t a fashion show, being too deliberate would invite ridicule. The stylist chose a subtle and elegant high-grade gray outfit, and her long hair, tied in a ponytail, lessened the formality of the gown while emphasizing a youthful vibe appropriate for her age.
 

 
Many photos with Tong Zhao ended up in the news.
 

 
The fans happily basked in her beauty, putting aside the unpleasantness.
 

 
After all, the sister said she wanted to bring them positive influence.
 

 
Being a fan should be fun!
 

 
Tong Zhao, dazzling with the aura of Consort Chen, managed to handle all the scheming behind the photos where only she was edited in, as no amount of editing would work unless they made her look ugly—then it would be too obvious and would lead to endless mockery from the all-seeing netizens.
 

 
Other female stars also attended the birthday banquet, ready with their glamorous press releases...
 

 
But they seemed a bit unconvincing!
 

 
Especially for those who shared the frame with Tong Zhao; only their own fans could praise them with their eyes closed, while passersby looked on with a face full of “Emmm…”
 

 
Consort Chen felt quite wronged.
 

 
Consort Chen: “I’m just a tool for Zhao Zhao to shine in the spotlight.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Youth fades, but affection has already withered, wuwuwu…”
 

 
Seeing her pretend to cry while covering her face, Tong Zhao was speechless.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m afraid if I let you out for a moment, the sect will turn into a fish pond later.”
 

 
Consort Chen blinked her beautiful and innocent eyes as if asking her: “What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that everything was wrong.
 

 
Because after talking with Elder Deng, when he proposed to take her as his last disciple, the atmosphere was very warm and serious.
 

 
Director Deng explicitly mentioned that he saw her as a good candidate for martial arts, and her subconscious in “One Life Survivor” exhibited a kind of decisive aura that all his disciples lacked... reminiscent of his comrades from his fighting days. When Director Deng was young, he was part of the effort to defend the country, and he admired her particularly: “It would be a shame not to join the military.”
 

 
After a moment of thought, Director Deng added, “Actually, not all disciples are lacking, but those that are, didn’t survive.”
 

 
The disciples he took in their thirties all died on the battlefield.
 

 
The following thirty years witnessed the rapid development of China.
 

 
So, his gaze toward Tong Zhao was filled with nostalgia.
 

 
Aside from Director Deng’s pure fondness for her, the other senior brothers’ friendliness toward her was polite and somewhat distant, knowing she was about to star in Shi Dingjun’s film. Their conversations revolved entirely around the movie. Tong Zhao keenly observed that this sect resembled the Jewish community in Hollywood, supporting younger members and exchanging benefits... Action movies are one of the more profitable genres, and nearly ninety percent of the excellent action films on the market in Huaxia come from Director Deng’s disciples, who wouldn’t be willing to share this cake with outsiders.
 

 
However, there were very few female disciples under Director Deng, making Tong Zhao a low-threat, high-value new member for them.
 

 
From the news and the public’s perspective, Tong Zhao, surrounded by admirers while sitting next to Director Deng, appeared to be the “darling of the group.”
 

 
But at the core, Tong Zhao understood very well…
 

 
This was yet another venue for exchanging benefits, and she had inadvertently obtained a ticket to enter.
 

 
Just like in more traditional settings, there were always the remnants of drinking culture, but no one forced her to drink and no one made vulgar jokes at her expense. Because she was recently very popular and was expected to become even more so, there were no handles or black spots to use against her. Her demeanor constantly emphasized that she did not intend to leverage her beauty to gain anything...
 

 
After a few rounds of drinks, Tong Zhao assisted the elderly director’s wife into a car and remained sober.
 

 
She sat in the nanny van and took out her phone to check the online response.
 

 
The atmosphere was anything but calm.
 

 
In the world of showbiz, one had to keep fighting every day.
 

 
Fans' excited emotions were calmed down; there was no widespread online outrage, and the trolls quickly fell silent. Some even turned their attitudes 180 degrees and angrily criticized the rumor mongers—ironically, the ones who cursed the most fiercely were not Tong Zhao's fans but those who had initially followed the trend to mock her, only to realize they had been slapped in the face.
 

 
Some trolls showed traces of being backed by other groups, and their operations were not clean enough, leaving behind evidence that was noted down.
 

 
Tong Zhao only recognized some names as fellow actresses of the same age group.
 

 
Their faces were blurred, and she had little impression of them.
 

 
The malice directed at her was overwhelming.
 

 
However, this was not a personal grudge; if she accumulated more mocked history, it could indeed tarnish her currently glittering crown for a while.
 

 
The assistant who flew with her to Qin City handed her a thermos: “Sister Zhao, you didn’t eat much at the birthday banquet, did you? Do you want to drink something?”
 

 
Tong Zhao unscrewed the cap, revealing steaming hot chicken soup inside.
 

 
Due to her cultivation practice and good fitness habits, she didn’t pay much attention to her diet. At this moment, she was indeed hungry, so she smiled and thanked her assistant, then lowered her head to sip the chicken soup in small gulps. The rich and fragrant soup soothed the slight turmoil stirred up by the online chaos—
 

 
It was over.
 

 
Whether in reality or the online farce, everything had temporarily come to a close...
 

 
Not so fast!
 

 
Reality does influence the subconscious, so before filming began, Tong Zhao had to stay in Qin City to learn all the martial arts that might be used in “The Knives of the Maiden.” She didn’t aim to master them; at the very least, she wanted to keep the concepts in her mind, which was a kind of “skill” in the film industry, proven to be somewhat helpful.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao’s role in “The Knives of the Maiden” was a done deal, the focus of fans and reporters shifted to—
 

 
Since learning martial arts is so difficult, will she study hard?
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Save the children.”
 

 
Duan Ge: "Okay."
 

 
Shuyi: "Do I also need to learn together?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It's decided. You will take turns sitting in the main character's position, and I'll be in charge of supervision."
# Chapter84
Amateur martial arts practice isn’t hard.
 

 
It’s a very good way to strengthen the body.
 

 
However, starting from a young age is different.
 

 
First, let’s mention that the pain of having a master help you stretch your muscles is deeply ingrained in one’s memory.
 

 
The so-called training comes from the heart, and it is a tedious and painful process that comes from within—like holding a horse stance; can you find joy in that? It’s much harder than lifting weights or doing cardio in a gym. So when Tong Zhao reported to the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy, her senior martial artists in the academy reminded her to never show off in front of Director Deng. If she couldn’t endure it, she must speak up…
 

 
“Just a few years ago, a wealthy businessman who loved collecting antiques and revered traditional Chinese culture used his connections to spend a lot of money to send his grandson here to study martial arts. He wanted the best, and we told him that Director Deng is strict and that following him would definitely be tough, so it would be better to choose some senior brothers who are higher up in the ranking, who are a bit younger and known to be more lenient, knowing that young people can’t handle it,” the sixth senior brother shook his head and sighed. “But that rich man was undeterred and insisted on getting the best. He asked me…”
 

 
Tong Zhao was curious: “What did he ask?”
 

 
The sixth senior brother replied, “He asked if Director Deng had a different price.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
The sixth senior brother was forty this year and had a reliable and honest appearance, making it hard for Tong Zhao to judge if he was joking about Master Deng. He continued, “As a result, the kid was stubborn and refused to admit he was struggling, so Master didn’t really push him to the limit. It was just too tough, and the kid found a chance to sneak back home, saying he didn’t want to come back.”
 

 
“He complained to his parents and caused trouble for the martial arts academy?”
 

 
“Not really,” the sixth senior brother sighed. “The rich man thought his child couldn’t handle the hardship. Director Deng began to doubt his teaching methods were outdated. After that, he refused to accept any more students through connections until he saw you, junior sister…”
 

 
“Master said he was initially impressed by your fighting scenes in the variety show, and later, when he watched the earlier episodes, he found out you could endure hardships very well.”
 

 
“What did he notice specifically?”
 

 
Having heard a lot of flattery from fans, Tong Zhao wanted to know how Director Deng, such an important figure, appreciated her.
 

 
The sixth senior brother appeared more embarrassed: “Those instant noodles without seasoning packets.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao's respect for her master slightly declined.
 

 
In the bustling city of Qin, the martial arts academy felt like a paradise amid a concrete jungle, with a purely traditional Chinese-designed courtyard that was quite elegant. Master Deng and some of his core disciples lived here. Daily expenses came from tuition fees from apprentices and occasional offerings from disciples. Master Deng himself had a substantial fortune, which clearly indicated that he wasn’t short on money.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood that part of this “offering” was a return for Director Deng’s help in connecting her to good resources in the film industry.
 

 
In traditional films, the fighting scenes are judged by the actors; in instinctive films, they are judged by the action designers.
 

 
An excellent action designer is the soul of an action movie; the actors are just puppets controlled by them. Shi Dingjun was not satisfied with filming a puppet, which is why he favored Tong Zhao, who could perform incredibly well without needing action design coding.
 

 
“Master, I’ve brought my junior sister over.”
 

 
As they passed the indoor training hall, the shouting faded away.
 

 
After crossing a picturesque bridge with flowing water, they arrived at a wooden door.
 

 
“Let her in; you go on with your work.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother complied.
 

 
Thinking that Director Deng preferred Duan Ge and that martial arts practice was hard…
 

 
Cough!
 

 
Whether or not she practiced martial arts wasn’t important; what mattered was her respect for the elder.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay, you can go rest now.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Alright!”
 

 
Tong Zhao bounced around like Nobita from "Doraemon" asking for help.
 

 
Although she seemed very mature in front of others, in front of “herself,” she was always that childish kid fantasizing, “If only there were another me to go to school and do homework while I could just play.”
 

 
Duan Ge walked into the study and saw the energetic Director Deng writing calligraphy, just finishing the last character.
 

 
What was he writing?
 

 
A treasure for women?
 

 
Duan Ge took a closer look.
 

 
Oh, it turned out to be “A Warm Welcome.”
 

 
Director Deng smiled and invited her to sit, chatting with her about the operations of the martial arts academy.
 

 
“One month doesn’t really teach much; in the past, it would have just been basic practice. But it can’t be helped; your time is precious,” he said, his tone a bit helpless and annoyed, like he was jealous of fame and fortune. He knew that even though Tong Zhao was a great talent, he wouldn’t be able to keep her by his side to teach her: “The master only hopes that after you finish filming Xiao Jun’s movie, you’ll have time to practice what I taught you. Just don’t forget everything; you’ll need it in the future.”
 

 
Even though he had a high status in the industry and was usually respected, Director Deng didn’t put on airs. Instead, he genuinely treated Tong Zhao as a beloved junior: “When you came, Xiao Liu mentioned the incident where I scared my little disciple back home, right? It really wasn’t that bad; if you had just talked to me, I could have worked something out with you.”
 

 
When mentioning this, Director Deng seemed a bit troubled:
 

 
“I’ll teach you everything you need to know. Do you want me to teach you in a way suitable for a disciple, or do you just want to cover the basics for the sake of the movie? Don’t be afraid and don’t force yourself; just be honest.”
 

 
By the end of it, the master who had nurtured many stars in the film industry looked like a wronged old man.
 

 
Duan Ge echoed something similar to what the wealthy businessman had said:
 

 
“I want the best; just hold me to the highest standards.”
 

 
Duan Ge's thoughts were simple and straightforward.
 

 
Director Deng is recognized as the most formidable figure in Chinese martial arts. It would be foolish to miss out on such a great opportunity to learn. What does hardship matter? Duan Ge’s daily routine is all about enduring hardship, and being able to stay peacefully in the palace of consciousness doesn’t suit her at all. That’s why when Tong Zhao underwent the consciousness test through the Instinct Film Association, she saw Duan Ge’s room piled high with survival resources, cramped and narrow… all remnants of the shadows from her previous experiences in a post-apocalyptic world.
 

 
Director Deng glanced at her: “Don’t force yourself.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ll know if I try.”
 

 
Only then did Director Deng turn to face her properly: “You need to get up at five-thirty every morning.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I can get up at five to make breakfast for you, Master.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this a reverse bargain?
 

 
Director Deng clearly didn’t expect his little disciple to make such a move: “That’s not really necessary…”
 

 
“Respect for my teacher is the right thing to do.”
 

 
Duan Ge has always been very clear about her relationships and is quite perceptive about people.
 

 
Director Deng truly cares for Tong Zhao, showing genuine affection for a promising junior in martial arts.
 

 
“Throw me a peach, I’ll return it with a plum.”
 

 
Director Deng stared at her for a while, suddenly less friendly, as if he didn’t dare to be too happy in advance. He snorted coldly and called the sixth senior brother in to help her choose a room, saying in a gruff voice, “If you’re just going to learn casually, you can stay in a nearby hotel and come over for five hours of class each day. It would be much easier.”
 

 
This expectation mixed with fear of being hurt…
 

 
It was like a girl who had been deceived by ten scumbags; one could see she was becoming more childlike with each passing day.
 

 
This was the first step to treating Tong Zhao like one of their own.
 

 
As Duan Ge stepped forward, she turned back and said, “From early morning to evening, Master, don’t worry about getting tired.”
 

 
Director Deng felt amused and snorted heavily again, secretly resolving to see the results tomorrow.
 

 
He truly intended to bring out the strictness he had shown to his previously accepted disciples and see how long this delicate little girl could hold on!
 

 
……
 

 
The sixth senior brother led Duan Ge to the dormitory area.
 

 
There weren’t many core disciples living in the martial arts academy, and the dormitory areas for female and male disciples were clearly separated. The female disciples were already few, and in recent years, the senior sisters had all moved out due to marriage and childbirth, so Duan Ge basically had the place to herself, even more comfortable than staying in a hotel suite…
 

 
Though it was called a dormitory, it felt more like a quaint resort.
 

 
After all, this place isn’t designed for profit by widely accepting disciples, so there’s no need for large dormitories.
 

 
It’s more like a prestigious mansion that has just a few too many grandchildren.
 

 
After Duan Ge chose her room, the sixth senior brother didn’t go inside due to the separation of the genders: “A cleaner will come every day to tidy up. If you don’t need it, just hang the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign outside the door. Flip it over, and it means ‘Please come in to clean,’” he added, thinking for a moment about what else to say. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in his head, and he comforted her, saying, “Master can be a bit childlike with those close to him, so don’t take it to heart. He treats his disciples very well.”
 

 
“Master said that today you should just get familiar with the environment, and learning will start tomorrow.”
 

 
Duan Ge smiled slightly.
 

 
She could, of course, distinguish between malicious difficulty and playful arrogance.
 

 
“I understand. Since Master arranged everything so thoughtfully, I should be grateful.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother breathed a sigh of relief, and his gaze toward her became even more affectionate.
 

 
At forty years old, with a daughter around Tong Zhao’s age who was off having fun in college, he could only express his paternal love through money transfers. Now, seeing his junior sister felt like looking at his daughter’s classmate, filled with the strange affection of a father.
 

 
His little junior sister was just too cute.
 

 
However, for some reason, after she met with Master, her demeanor suddenly changed.
 

 
She looked a bit fierce.
 

 
Thus, the sixth senior brother unconsciously thought Master had said something wrong, making his little junior sister unhappy—ever since the last time Master had taught a little disciple who couldn’t endure the hardship and ran back home, Master had been quite affected. After all, he could tell that Master genuinely liked that child…
 

 
Master also liked Tong Zhao.
 

 
Did he scare her off with his usual arrogance when they first met? The sixth senior brother sighed inwardly.
 

 
That’s why he offered such comforting words to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Duan Ge, who wasn’t scared at all, thought this environment was simply too good.
 

 
It was comfortable to stay here, and the sect had such pleasant conversations; she liked it here a lot.
 

 
Tong Zhao was truly deep in sleep this time. Unless Zeshan had something urgent to discuss or Sister Chu had official business with her, she didn’t want to be disturbed for anything else. It felt like she was on an extended vacation, resting in her consciousness palace, sorting through her past memories, filling in the gaps, and playing with Zhao Zai…
 

 
“Shouldn’t I be doing something that a female celebrity is supposed to do?”
 

 
Duan Ge turned around in her room.
 

 
Han Zhi gave her a suggestion: “A month of training might be too long. If you want to engage with fans, you could document your little training moments, like filming a Vlog.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Oh, I can tell you’re an old influencer just by the way you speak.”
 

 
Duan Ge asked both Master and Sister Chu for permission to film a Vlog via WeChat.
 

 
Master: “Sure. Deng.”
 

 
Master: “No one’s not around. Deng.”
 

 
According to the sixth senior brother, the “Deng” at the end was Master’s signature.
 

 
Master: “But you need to clarify the main mission of your visit to the martial arts school. Deng. [Muay Thai warning. (Panda head punching) gif]”
 

 
……
 

 
How should she put it……
 

 
Did she need to explain that the Muay Thai warning wasn’t used in that way?
 

 
But it didn’t seem wrong either.
 

 
The internal struggle between being fashionable and retro was definitely a reflection of Master himself.
 

 
After receiving approval, Duan Ge began filming her Vlog with Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
After filming for three minutes, Han Zhi couldn’t take it anymore: “Can I do it instead? I’m better at this.”
 

 
Duan Ge scratched her head and stepped aside.
 

 
When it came to filming, Shuyi and Han Zhi were the best.
 

 
However, once Shuyi started talking, her tone became strange: “Martial arts is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese nation. As time goes by, this ancient culture is gradually fading away… If we’re talking about the place where martial arts traditions are preserved the best, we cannot bypass the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center and Master Deng. Today, as a student, I have come to the martial arts center…”
 

 
In short, the documentary felt overly intense and not very feminine.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t used to being feminine; after stretching a bit in front of the full-length mirror, he started filming.
 

 
After putting on the mask, Han Zhi ran to the entrance of the center, re-recording some footage and editing the process of Tong Zhao arriving at the center.
 

 
Without a smartphone stabilizer, it was still a bit difficult to film.
 

 
The first night at the martial arts school was spent filming and editing with Han Zhi.
 

 
……
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
Arrived at the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center in the afternoon.
 

 
Little junior sister is all set!
 

 
PS: This trip doesn’t have an assistant following me; this Vlog was filmed while learning, so please bear with me.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t need to learn anything.
 

 
Doing this made him appear even more diligent.
 

 
This kind of self-promotion was his occupational habit; he did it effortlessly.
 

 
Under Tong Zhao’s Weibo, many fans were eagerly waiting for updates.
 

 
As soon as this new post came out, the number of comments visibly shot up from 0 to three digits, and after refreshing, it hit four digits.
 

 
The growth rate was comparable to real estate prices.
 

 
You just think about how to be clever, and suddenly, the front row turns into the back row.
 

 
The video wasn’t long, just five minutes, briefly introducing the martial arts school and her living arrangements.
 

 
Han Zhi had a strong sense of the camera, making the short video feel like a professional promotional film; once the filter was applied, the fans couldn’t believe their sister had filmed it.
 

 
[Your sister did such a great job! So talented and versatile!]
 

 
[Already at the location? Are you going to train for a month? Sounds tough…]
 

 
[Even during the traditional film era, your sister must have been a particularly hard-working actress.]
 

 
Originally, it was just meant to be filmed for promotion, but unexpectedly, after Shi Dingjun saw it, he contacted her via WeChat and asked if she would be interested in turning the month-long training into a video. He had always wanted to shoot some short clips to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center but had never found a good opportunity. Today, seeing her film the martial arts school in such a relatable way, he knew it could definitely appeal to a younger audience.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “I’m not looking to profit from this; I just want more young people to know about our martial arts school.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “If you’re willing, I can arrange for a photographer from my team to come and assist you in filming the videos.”
 

 
……
 

 
Han Zhi, who really just wanted to do some promotion: "..."
 

 
Thinking about it, it didn't seem like a bad idea!
# Chapter85
Han Zhi agreed to it.
 

 
Shi Dingjun was very efficient and sent the photographer that same evening.
 

 
According to him, Xuanxuan was a particularly hardworking girl, and it was fine to let her sleep on a folding bed. This wasn’t meant to be harsh; if she was going to follow Tong Zhao around for 24 hours for filming, it would be more convenient for them to share a room. Finding a female photographer was also for this reason.
 

 
Xuanxuan was very willing.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t want to impose on the girl like this, so he went to discuss adding a bed in the room with Sixth Senior Brother. Since the suite provided for the junior sister was quite large, having one more person wouldn’t make it feel cramped.
 

 
Han Zhi: “If it’s going to be 24-hour filming, then I can’t do it. Duan Ge, you come back.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “By the way, are the class hours split evenly between me and Shuyi? Who goes first?”
 

 
For a full 24 hours, the two personalities would be divided.
 

 
Shuyi: “You go first.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why so polite with me?”
 

 
Shuyi: “I just don’t want to get up early…”
 

 
With this simple statement about not wanting to wake up early, the conversation suddenly felt more real.
 

 
Before Han Zhi left the main personality position, he discussed filming ideas with the photographer, Xuanxuan, for half an hour. After reaching a consensus, he let Duan Ge take back control of the body. She stretched her neck a bit and heard Xuanxuan excitedly ask, “By the way, I need to film you getting up every day, so I’ll need to wake up earlier than you. What time does Sister Zhao plan to wake up?”
 

 
Her smile was full of excitement, with a rosy glow on her fair cheeks.
 

 
Oh my.
 

 
She was going to film Tong Zhao!
 

 
That was almost on the same level as the treatment given to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xuanxuan's lips curl up uncontrollably.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Five o’clock.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Xuanxuan’s smile suddenly faltered.
 

 
Xuanxuan: “Is, is it really that early...?”
 

 
“Yeah, I’ll get up early to make breakfast,” Duan Ge asked with concern, “Can you not make it?”
 

 
Thinking she might be replaced, Xuanxuan quickly shook her head.
 

 
"I can get up, don’t worry, it’s no problem at all!"
 

 
Duan Ge gave a light "mm" in response: “Get some rest early tonight.”
 

 
During the apocalypse, entertainment was almost nonexistent. Physical books were unexpectedly precious; later, her survival base found a large number of books in a warehouse—most likely from a bookstore’s storage. Those books became something her subordinates eagerly borrowed. Therefore, Duan Ge had a low demand for entertainment and had long since given up the habit of using it, even in harsh environments.
 

 
At ten o’clock that night, when Xuanxuan still wanted to play on her phone for a while, she saw that Duan Ge had already covered herself with a blanket.
 

 
From her calm and steady breathing, it seemed she had fallen asleep.
 

 
…What a disciplined modern woman!
 

 
How could a modern person go to bed at ten o'clock without playing on their phone at all!
 

 
So impressive.
 

 
Of course, Xuanxuan already knew that Tong Zhao was very talented, but seeing her go to bed and fall asleep in seconds at ten o'clock made Xuanxuan's admiration rise to another level. Observing Tong Zhao's discipline, she felt embarrassed to continue playing on her phone. She obediently set a vibrating alarm for four-thirty and turned off her screen to sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
At four-thirty, Xuanxuan was jolted awake by the phone vibrating under her pillow for a second and quickly pressed the snooze button.
 

 
Once she shook off the grogginess of just waking up, a sense of accomplishment spread across her face.
 

 
She was up!
 

 
Fortunately, she had seen Sister Zhao go to sleep early last night, so she also seized the opportunity to rest. Otherwise, waking up this early would have been unbearable. Xuanxuan tiptoed out of bed and unexpectedly locked eyes with Duan Ge, who had already sat up in bed: "..."
 

 
Unlike her groggy, dazed expression, Duan Ge looked awake, her complexion slightly pale but her eyes bright and alert.
 

 
Wait, she had only just woken up a few seconds ago!
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ve noticed a problem.”
 

 
Xuanxuan stared at her blankly: “What is it, Sister Zhao?”
 

 
Duan Ge continued: “I’m the type who wakes up at the slightest sound of life nearby, so you won’t be able to capture me waking up to the alarm because I’ll be fully awake by the time you’re about ten steps away.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The photographer was even more dumbfounded.
 

 
She had considered many obstacles to filming, like a big star throwing a tantrum, and last night she had even been secretly relieved that Sister Zhao was easy to get along with and had specially arranged a large bed for her. She never expected that difficulties were waiting for her. She blurted out, “W-why is that?”
 

 
Duan Ge paused for a moment, omitting the cause and only stating the result: “When a person is sleeping, they are usually unguarded, right? I just feel it’s dangerous. Even if I try to convince myself that you’re not a threat, I will still wake up… it’s instinct.”
 

 
As the photographer considered probing further, she recalled the family scandal that had come to light about Sister Zhao.
 

 
She heard that Sister Zhao’s father was an abusive scumbag!
 

 
Growing up in such a cold and brutal family, it was only natural that her instincts would be sharper than most people’s. The photographer felt a surge of sympathy.
 

 
Not revealing someone’s scars is the most basic courtesy, so she immediately suppressed her inappropriate curiosity and quickly came to an understanding: “Okay, then can you lie back down and pretend to be asleep? I’ll get everything ready, and when your alarm goes off, you can pretend to wake up then.”
 

 
That was easy enough to do.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded and lay back down.
 

 
Startled by Sister Zhao, the photographer’s sleepiness vanished completely. She hurried to wash her face, brush her teeth, and change into comfortable clothes. Once she got the camera ready, she said, “I’m starting to film in three seconds.”
 

 
At five in the morning, it was still dark outside.
 

 
The alarm rang, and the bedside lamp gradually lit up. Duan Ge, who had been wide awake for a while, sat up in bed. The light from the bedside lamp cast a warm glow over her pale skin, making her look like the heroine in an art film. The photographer instantly understood why the famous director liked to film her so much—Shi Qianqiu was also notoriously picky about aesthetics on camera and had won many photography awards during college.
 

 
Even with no makeup, Sister Zhao looked beautiful!
 

 
Duan Ge looked at the camera and said in a hoarse voice, “Can you step outside and wait for me? I need to change clothes.”
 

 
The photographer quickly nodded and stepped outside.
 

 
She had mentally prepared herself for a long wait, but unexpectedly, within ten minutes, Duan Ge came out fully dressed.
 

 
Most people, after getting up and taking a morning shower, tend to daze off in the hot water, but Duan Ge wasn’t accustomed to that. She was very disciplined, taking what she called a “standard three-minute combat shower.” Afterward, she applied skincare products to her skin based on memory, using serums and moisturizers, all while getting dressed and doing her light makeup, resembling a well-trained robot.
 

 
The weather had turned a bit cold recently, with even lower temperatures in the morning.
 

 
From the photographer's perspective, Sister Zhao appeared in a black long-sleeve sports outfit, her hair tied in a high ponytail… Before coming to Qin City, her stylist had curled her hair, and now her ponytail had a graceful wave that softened the sharpness of her bangs that were all slicked back. She wore very light makeup; her long eyebrows framed her softly hazel eyes, which seemed to hold a distant, misty look.
 

 
Her fair skin glowed against the morning chill, giving her an air of cool detachment that left the photographer mesmerized.
 

 
“Let’s go.”
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her chin toward the photographer and walked straight ahead.
 

 
It was only then that the photographer, still taken aback by her understated beauty, snapped back to reality and quickly nodded to follow her.
 

 
Last night, Duan Ge had asked her sixth senior brother about Master’s meal arrangements.
 

 
The sixth senior brother said that everyone in the martial arts school ate in a common dining hall, and Master was no exception.
 

 
When the Master’s wife was in good health, she used to eat with him, but her health had deteriorated over the years. After forcing herself to attend Master’s sixtieth birthday banquet, she returned to the nursing home. Master was willing to take care of her, but given her condition required constant medical attention, it was inappropriate for her to stay at the martial arts school.
 

 
After learning about Master’s dietary preferences and restrictions, Duan Ge went to the kitchen to make chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles. She also made a cup of soy milk and prepared two meat buns from the kitchen. Since she had gone to bed early last night, she could have prepared more simple dishes beforehand, making it easy to get breakfast ready in the morning.
 

 
As for herself, she simply took some meat buns and plain porridge from the kitchen.
 

 
The photographer also grabbed some to eat.
 

 
The meat buns were stuffed generously with filling, and the juices soaked through the bun skin, making them particularly delicious.
 

 
Duan Ge lost count of how many she had eaten; she just continued until she was full.
 

 
…
 

 
After yesterday's meal with Tong Zhao, Director Deng had completely forgotten about her plan to wake up early to make breakfast for Master.
 

 
How could she possibly wake up on time?
 

 
He heard that Xiao Jun had arranged for her to have a photographer, hoping to get her up in the morning.
 

 
Director Deng didn’t think much of it and continued with his usual morning routine. Just as he was preparing to go to the dining hall for breakfast, the doorbell rang.
 

 
So early, who could it be?
 

 
A flicker of anticipation rose in Director Deng’s heart but was quickly suppressed.
 

 
“Who is it?”
 

 
He asked loudly while opening the door.
 

 
Behind the door stood his young disciple.
 

 
“Master, breakfast is ready.”
 

 
In an instant, Director Deng felt as if he had returned to twenty years ago...
 

 
Back then, the disciples he took in all adhered to such rules, doing everything they could to please their master.
 

 
As he grew older, he lost the desire to take on students.
 

 
The last time he accepted a disciple was ten years ago, and that experience had been quite dismal, almost like a reminder that his way of teaching was no longer in vogue.
 

 
Granddisciples were not as rewarding to instruct.
 

 
Director Deng had a bit of a craving to take in disciples again.
 

 
Seeing Duan Ge standing there, enveloped in the cold morning air, made Director Deng’s heart soften immensely.
 

 
The feeling was akin to that of a player in many online games who, after completing a system task, is given a disciple, only to be touched and embarrassed when the disciple presents them with thoughtful little herbal dishes or other items.
 

 
“Did you really go and get me breakfast? You didn’t need to go to all this trouble. What time did you wake up?”
 

 
Despite his effort to appear dismissive, the joy on Director Deng’s face was unmistakable as he accepted the tray. “Come in quickly. After I finish breakfast, we’ll head to the morning class—although the lesson is tailored to your performance needs, it’s a rare opportunity for the other disciples, so those interested will join in to learn. If anyone isn’t focused on martial arts, I’ll send them back to the second and third halls.”
 

 
The martial arts practice spaces were mostly spacious indoor areas.
 

 
The second and third halls were where ordinary disciples attended classes; the first hall was reserved for when Director Deng taught his disciples. Even though it had been years since he had needed it, he was reluctant to let anyone else use it, saying they could do as they pleased once he passed on.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t hold back and walked in with the photographer.
 

 
Han Zhi: “I just realized that Director Shi sending a photographer over is incredibly timely.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Hmm? How so?”
 

 
Shuyi: “With a month of one-on-one instruction, although Master is in his sixties, there could still be malicious speculation… Having a photographer present at all times can help extinguish any potential misunderstandings.”
 

 
After hearing their analysis, Duan Ge realized this aspect as well.
 

 
She could certainly sense Director Deng’s fondness for her; it was the affection an elder shows to a junior. However, many people would gladly wish for Tong Zhao’s downfall.
 

 
Duan Ge: “I need to gather evidence in advance for things I haven’t done.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, "This is exactly the kind of thing celebrities have to worry about for a lifetime. You wouldn’t believe how much reporters want you to get into trouble."
 

 
Director Deng finished his breakfast quickly.
 

 
After eating, he frowned, sensing something was off.
 

 
He had been eating the cafeteria chef's dishes for over ten years, and aside from the meat buns being at a familiar level, the chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles were typical Chinese breakfast items. However, as he ate, he noticed they tasted different from usual—much better than normal. The highlight was the soy sauce noodles, topped with a savory sauce made from diced pork stir-fried with seasonings. It was incredibly satisfying.
 

 
At that moment, Director Deng thought that Duan Ge had simply brought him the cafeteria's dishes.
 

 
Just this gesture was already enough to touch the master.
 

 
Director Deng ate quickly and then led her to a classroom.
 

 
The other disciples who had come to learn were sitting quietly in the corner, not daring to look too much.
 

 
After all, they were all young men in their prime, and Tong Zhao was a well-known beauty in the entertainment industry. They were afraid of embarrassing themselves by staring at her, and they certainly didn’t want to give the junior sister a bad impression of the sect, making her think that all the disciples were lecherous. So, before they arrived, they were sternly reminded to keep their focus on learning. If they were caught behaving inappropriately in front of their senior aunt, they would be sent back to the second and third halls and reprimanded!
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was personally taken in by Master Deng, she ranked higher in seniority than these disciples.
 

 
They should call her "Senior Aunt."
 

 
As soon as Director Deng entered the room, he waved for the boys to come over and greet her as "Senior Aunt."
 

 
So, under the watchful eyes of the camera and Duan Ge...
 

 
These boys, afraid of losing their resolve and being distracted by her beauty, kept their heads down, showing only their black hair as they took turns saying, "Good day, Master Deng! Good day, Senior Aunt!"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s persona didn’t have low emotional intelligence.
 

 
After all, this was one of her core traits.
 

 
Duan Ge was no exception; she could sense that these younger disciples were not entirely convinced about calling her "Senior Aunt," but under the authority of Master Deng, they had to comply.
 

 
Duan Ge raised an eyebrow.
 

 
Consort Chen: “One-on-one combat, smash them!”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I really suspect your palace intrigue skills refer to physical combat.”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied: “I’ve beaten my fair share of provocateurs, but I’d rather not dirty my hands myself; my hands are too delicate. Why not let the maids and eunuchs deal with it? Everyone has their specialties.” She said the most arrogant things in the sweetest tone.
 

 
The photographer was relieved to find that once she set up the camera, she could sit to the side and take a quick rest.
 

 
If nothing special happens, then she will just consider it a chance to catch up on sleep.
 

 
With her eyes closed, she doesn't love anyone!
 

 
Once the photographer set up the camera and got everything ready, she was so tired that her single eyelid looked like a double eyelid. She couldn’t help but sneak a glance at Duan Ge.
 

 
As a result, she found Duan Ge full of energy, doing warm-up exercises.
 

 
The photographer was speechless; indeed, one’s physical condition varies from person to person!
 

 
…
 

 
Having learned from the last time he took on a disciple, Director Deng didn’t dare to have too high expectations for Tong Zhao at the beginning. He started by teaching her the basics.
 

 
He not only taught her martial arts moves but also explained the meaning behind each technique.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao was listening intently, Director Deng felt reassured that he hadn’t misjudged her.
 

 
Because Director Deng was taking it easy, the other disciples found his class much less demanding than their usual lessons with their own master. Is this really the stern Master Deng they had heard about? It wasn't until Director Deng noticed that Tong Zhao was able to learn everything quickly that he gradually began to raise his expectations.
 

 
A week passed, and the other disciples began to struggle. They went to their master to say that the pace was too fast and requested that he give feedback to Master Deng to slow it down a bit.
 

 
Their master replied, "There’s nothing I can do. This was originally a private lesson for Tong Zhao. How much you learn is your own fortune; as long as she keeps up, Master Deng has no reason to slow down the teaching pace for you."
 

 
That made sense.
 

 
However, the other disciples were skeptical: had Tong Zhao really learned everything?
 

 
They all thought it was too fast; didn’t Tong Zhao feel the same way?
 

 
So someone went to ask her.
 

 
During a break, Director Deng was not far away and perked up his ears when he heard this question.
 

 
Duan Ge was leisurely drinking water, replying, "It’s not fast; I think it’s just right."
 

 
The disciples were not convinced and didn’t believe she had really learned everything and found it just right. "Senior Aunt, don’t force yourself. It’s better to master one set before moving on to the next; you can’t bite off more than you can chew."
 

 
"I’m not forcing myself,"
 

 
Duan Ge finished her bottled water with a few hearty gulps, her beautiful eyes casually scanning the speaker. "Don’t believe me? Want to go one-on-one? Only with the techniques I’ve learned."
 

 
If there weren’t any pre-set restrictions, her fighting style would feel more streetwise.
 

 
Since it was a rare opportunity for "reviewing the old and learning the new," of course, it was best to use the techniques she had just learned!
 

 
The disciple clearly hadn’t expected the celebrity to propose a one-on-one match, and a look of disbelief crossed his face, as if to say, "Are you kidding me?" However, Duan Ge’s challenge was laid out before him, and backing down would be even more embarrassing. The martial arts school allowed disciples to spar with each other, so he had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree.
 

 
He turned back to discuss with the other disciples how they could go easy on her.
 

 
In his thoughts, he quickly imagined the moment he would be pinned to the ground by Duan Ge during the sparring match.
 

 
The dilemma of how to go easy on her turned into thoughts of how to defeat her.
 

 
Duan Ge stood tall, her expression still calm and composed.
 

 
There was a hint of restraint within her solitude.
 

 
It was genuinely hard to suppress her laughter.
 

 
Throughout the sparring match, her mind was filled with thoughts like…
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fight well, and hit harder! Show him he shouldn’t underestimate you!"
 

 
Shuyi: "Make it hurt a bit; I don’t want anyone else coming to challenge me when I’m on duty."
 

 
Duan Ge had become the golden fighter of Tong Zhao's personality.
 

 
For her, the hardest part was actually holding back her laughter during the match.
 

 
Just a moment ago, she couldn’t help but smile.
 

 
The defeated disciple A took a long time to regain his senses.
 

 
At one point, when his attack was countered and he was taken down, he caught a close-up glimpse of the slight curve of Duan Ge’s lips, as if she was trying hard to suppress something… Was it? Yes, she had numerous opportunities to deliver a lethal blow, and that was clearly a smile indicating the restraint of lethal intent!
 

 
Realizing this, disciple A felt a chill run down his spine. Once he managed to scramble to his feet, he cupped his fists and said, "Senior Aunt, you’re amazing! I willingly concede!"
 

 
The other disciples were skeptical, thinking he had gone too easy and messed up.
 

 
Naturally, a second disciple came forward to seek guidance.
 

 
Duan Ge felt it was a bit unfair—after all, she had a body cultivated through the way of immortals, where martial arts and spiritual practice were inseparable. Besides, she had far more experience in one-on-one combat than these young men, who were used to sparring with strict rules of martial ethics at the school. To put it bluntly, she knew exactly where to hit to make her opponent momentarily powerless, and her mindset was calm, confident, and free of fear. She possessed all the ideal traits of a martial artist.
 

 
But so what if it felt unfair?
 

 
The satisfaction of winning one after another was simply too exhilarating!
 

 
It only took one sparring match for them to go from casually calling her "Senior Aunt" to genuinely respecting her as their mentor.
 

 
A month passed quickly.
 

 
During this not too long or too short period of time together, the photographer had completely turned into a fan of Tong Zhao. Anyone who lived with her and wanted to improve while often procrastinating would be infected by her unrelenting drive and action. When the photographer excitedly took the footage back to edit, Tong Zhao also woke up from her holiday and returned to her original city, diving into a series of promotional appearances.
 

 
She appeared on an interview program and a traditional variety show themed around ancient cuisine.
 

 
In this variety show, guests were required to wear ancient costumes.
 

 
This provided an opportunity for Consort Chen to perform—
 

 
In fact, Tong Zhao initially planned to do it herself, but when Consort Chen playfully said she wanted to join in, Tong Zhao agreed!
 

 
Whatever she wanted to do, pampering herself was the priority.
 

 
On the variety show, Consort Chen radiated an aura that outshone everyone else. The combined effect of the system's aura and her own enchanting presence created a multiplier effect that was far more than just 1 + 1.
 

 
As a result, the other female guests were completely overshadowed.
 

 
It wasn’t that the production team didn’t film them; they did, but their discussions were quickly overshadowed.
 

 
Some female guests were relieved that Tong Zhao was only appearing for one episode, thinking that they would be fine once that was over.
 

 
However, others couldn’t sit still.
# Chapter86
"Breaking News! Tong Zhao and Rumored Boyfriend Spotted in Qin City: Is It Fake Studying or Real Affair?"
 

 
"Mr. Wei's Green Hat: Is the Truth Really Like This?"
 

 
"Tong Zhao and Handsome Guy Caught in Flirty Interaction on the Streets: Fans Shocked and Disappointed"
 

 
The reporter who captured these photos made a tidy sum on the side.
 

 
Why was this only revealed now?
 

 
Because they were negotiating the price.
 

 
In this batch of photos, Tong Zhao, wearing a mask, was seen walking down the street with a tall man in black sportswear before they got into a car. There wasn't any ambiguous behavior; they didn't kiss or hold hands, so the photos weren't particularly valuable, and the entertainment media were reluctant to pay a high price for them. However, the reporter believed they should be worth more.
 

 
Since the price didn’t meet their expectations, the reporter preferred to keep them under wraps. After all, the reporter didn’t dislike Tong Zhao and even liked her movies.
 

 
It wasn't until Tong Zhao finished her closed-door training and appeared on "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat"...
 

 
Things unexpectedly got messy.
 

 
The timeline needs to be pushed back two days—
 

 
There was a co-star on the same show, actress Ning Siya, who had a tranquil demeanor and a deep understanding of ancient cuisine. She had recently gained some popularity with a light idol drama, "Palm-sized Preserved Fruits," which revolved around ancient food. Both her manager and she thought that "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" would be a great variety show choice for her.
 

 
Think about it: fans who loved her for the ancient culinary drama would see her in a similar-themed variety show and find her character very relatable, leading to increased affection for her. The interest generated by the variety show would also reflect positively on her drama, creating a virtuous cycle.
 

 
But the problem was that Tong Zhao was also on the same show.
 

 
During the costume change segment, Ning Siya chose a light yellow ancient dress. Another female guest asked her if she didn’t prefer wearing white. She replied, “In most dynasties, white is considered an unlucky mourning color. Although I really like the clean and unblemished look of white, I still have to remember the traditions of our ancestors.”
 

 
Because they were going to shoot in a resort themed like an ancient palace, this statement didn’t seem unreasonable. It painted the image of a cultured girl who valued traditions. However, another female guest, who wasn’t very educated, was nervously clutching a white outfit she apparently intended to wear. After hearing this, she awkwardly smiled and put the dress back.
 

 
Seeing this, Ning Siya also smiled and said, “If you have any questions about the rules, feel free to ask me. But I’m just an amateur; I’m only interested in this aspect.”
 

 
…At that moment, Consort Chen, dressed in a gown styled like a dragon robe, walked over and curiously asked, “According to the traditions, shouldn’t one kneel when seeing someone in a dragon robe?”
 

 
Ning Siya froze on the spot.
 

 
Seeing her not respond, Consort Chen finished her smile and went off to talk to someone else.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t entirely an “ancient person.” After all, from the beginning in the ancient world, Tong Zhao had known she was on a quick transmigration mission. It was her belief in “my fate is in my own hands, not dictated by heaven” and the spirit of “how can princes and nobles have more power than me?” that allowed her to break through many crises in unconventional ways. However, spending so long in that world—almost a lifetime—had formed her into a distinct personality.
 

 
So, when Consort Chen had the choice to wear what she liked, she unhesitatingly chose the audacious style of a dragon robe dress.
 

 
If the emperor could wear it, then so could she.
 

 
In fact, there was a time when she accidentally spilled tea, and the liquid soaked her foot; she even stepped on the emperor’s dragon robe to dry it off. What’s the big deal? She wore what she wanted and enjoyed herself. How could she uphold the title of Consort without being a little willful?
 

 
At that moment, Ning Siya was arranged to sit next to Tong Zhao, her beautiful face adorned with a gentle smile, presenting an ethereal, unworldly appearance.
 

 
Many people admired her style.
 

 
Elegant and serene, she resembled a fairy who had strayed into the mortal world.
 

 
But the problem was, sitting beside her was Consort Chen, radiating an overwhelming presence.
 

 
Bright yellow was already an eye-catching color, overshadowing Ning Siya, who wore a light yellow dress—did she prefer subtlety? Then she might as well embrace it.
 

 
There seemed to be no chance for her to shine brightly.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t targeting her specifically.
 

 
It was just that, as a favored Consort, she had developed the habit of wanting to stand out. Hiding her brilliance and playing second fiddle was impossible for her.
 

 
The theme of "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" was about modernized ancient cuisine, featuring segments where guests sampled food and also prepared simple dishes together. During the cooking segment, Consort Chen was clumsy and wanted to quit after a while. However, she forced herself to complete it, thinking of impressing Zhao Zhao on the show. It was quite humbling for her—this princess personally washing her hands to make soup; she definitely had to make Zhao Zhao happy afterward.
 

 
In this round, Ning Siya shone more brightly, but during the food tasting segment, all the attention was snatched by Consort Chen.
 

 
Even if one ingredient was of lesser quality, every dish prepared with care…
 

 
Consort Chen could discern every flavor; nothing escaped her taste buds.
 

 
The comments ranged from those criticizing her for being spoiled to others recognizing that she actually had a deep understanding and appreciation for ancient cuisine, just lacking in practical skills, which suited her role as a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao's portrayal of the concubine had resonated well with the audience.
 

 
After all, a concubine should be a bit pampered.
 

 
Moreover, her previous appearances on "72 Hours" and "One Life Survivor" proved she could endure hardship and withstand tough challenges, while being a little lazy and picky in peacetime was merely endearing.
 

 
Some viewers, holding onto the fantasy that "celebrities should be flawless," relentlessly criticized Tong Zhao in the comments.
 

 
[It’s puzzling—how can someone who can only eat but not cook be a cute point?]
 

 
[I think she just doesn’t want to work.]
 

 
This statement had some truth to it.
 

 
Consort Chen really didn’t want to work.
 

 
[Are we really saying Tong Zhao is lazy after just one episode????]
 

 
[Come on, this is just a light-hearted variety show; the guests are here to eat, drink, and have fun. Would you get scolded for not having the correct posture while farming at a homestay? Besides, Tong Zhao has always been quite capable in the kitchen. She just came out of closed-door training and only wants to eat, so what's wrong with that? Are you eating her rice?]
 

 
With this part of the criticism, the controversy surrounding Tong Zhao boosted the discussion of this episode of the variety show.
 

 
Of course, just eating and being picky can be off-putting, but Consort Chen also had her likable traits.
 

 
She sincerely praised the well-prepared dishes, noticing details that other guests missed:
 

 
“The broth is a bit bland. Adding vinegar would ruin the chef’s carefully crafted sweetness. If only we had Jinhua ham juice!”
 

 
When asked about a dish that had a texture similar to fish belly and fish maw, she was able to elaborate: “This is the tendon from the back of the sturgeon; it tastes like fish belly but has more bounce.”
 

 
However, she absolutely refused to eat fish with a muddy taste.
 

 
The comments playfully remarked that they had invited a serious emperor:
 

 
[Tong Zhao in a dragon robe is practically the emperor himself, aside from gender.]
 

 
[How about a gender-swapped version of "The Legend of Ming Emperor"? I’d definitely watch! I want to see Zhao Zhao as the female emperor!]
 

 
[No, no, no, she doesn’t have the taste of someone who commands the world. She’s better suited to play a foolish ruler who should be fed grapes by beautiful women, doing nothing but enjoying food and fun every day.]
 

 
Screenshots of Tong Zhao's beauty on the variety show were referred to as depictions of a pampered concubine donning a dragon robe.
 

 
#PamperedConcubineBigBoldTongZhao#
 

 
This trending topic was filled with Tong Zhao's expressive memes.
 

 
When she tasted a piece of fish with a slight fishy smell that the other guests didn’t notice, [Tong Zhao looked disdainful.jpg], her spoiled attitude was entirely justified. There was also the moment when someone asked Ning Siyu if she should kneel before the dragon robe, [Tong Zhao looked puzzled.jpg]... Whatever is fun, let’s go with it. Others might not know, but Song Wanzhuo had a whole collection of these memes in her WeChat and secretly gave a thumbs-up to the production team.
 

 
Half of the money behind this trending topic came from the "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" variety show team.
 

 
It wasn't because they were enchanted by Tong Zhao's charm.
 

 
It was simply because she was the most discussed point of this episode; the backend data clearly indicated it, and the show just went along to ride the wave of her popularity. While others joined the variety show to gain exposure, Tong Zhao’s presence ended up giving the show a boost in heat!
 

 
No one making a variety show would pass up the chance to invite Tong Zhao.
 

 
She always delivered unexpected results; for example, "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" had steady but mediocre ratings. As soon as she appeared, the ratings skyrocketed. It was completely worth the high price they paid to have her on.
 

 
The outcome was that no one was talking about Ning Siyu; her appearance was practically meaningless.
 

 
What angered Ning Siyu the most was seeing people who initially tuned in to watch "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" for her end up being captivated by Tong Zhao. Her manager comforted her, saying that because of Tong Zhao, this second-tier variety show had jumped to first-tier ratings, giving her higher exposure than before...
 

 
This consolation was worse than useless; Ning Siyu was furious!
 

 
Then there was that part where they asked her if she should kneel upon seeing the dragon robe, and the trolls were criticizing her for pretending and ruining her image. Of course, her elders, who had worked hard to liberate China with blood and tears, could wear whatever they wanted. How could she take other guests' advice on what to wear, using “the rules of our ancestors” to point fingers at them? Did she really think she was a cultured matriarch?
 

 
Ning Siyu felt that these people were just Tong Zhao's fans, coming to annoy her.
 

 
However, in reality, these trolls were simultaneously criticizing Consort Chen for being lazy, picky, and spoiled, merely behaving like typical trolls.
 

 
She really wanted to vent her frustration!
 

 
It was too easy for people in the industry to find dirt on others. Just a hint, and sellers would come looking for her.
 

 
Ning Siyu thought to herself that it was just the cost of three bags, and at worst, she could just act cute with her sugar daddy.
 

 
She bought bags for face value, and now Tong Zhao had made her lose face; venting her anger took priority over buying bags. She quickly arranged for the paparazzi to get a scoop... The reporter took the money and then sold it to the media for a cheaper price.
 

 
After all, Ning Siyu wanted him to expose Tong Zhao, and she never said he couldn’t make a second profit.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was more popular than her, she was confident this would hurt her!
 

 
...
 

 
Her manager asked Tong Zhao if she had any idea who she had offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao was just about to say no.
 

 
Consort Chen: [It must be that person sitting next to me with that gloomy face the whole time.]
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment and asked, “How did you know about this?”
 

 
Consort Chen replied, “I’m very sensitive to malice coming from the same gender.”
 

 
Truly a master of palace intrigue.
 

 
Since she didn’t respond, Sister Chu continued, “But it doesn’t matter. Who did it isn’t important; everyone wants to bring you down or ride your coattails. There’s really nothing to gain from this; it’s mostly just paparazzi snapping random shots.”
 

 
That reasoning was quite reasonable.
 

 
It was enough to consider all competitors as potential enemies; Tong Zhao never thought about making friends in the industry... The entertainment world was essentially a super-large corporation. For adults to genuinely want to befriend colleagues was naive and unnecessary. Of course, there are examples of true friendships, but more often than not, there are incompatible plastic friends, backstabbers competing for promotions, and those you think are friends but turn out to treat you as merely a colleague before quietly leaving, disappearing into the crowd.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao didn’t take the Ning family’s actions to heart, nor would she blame Consort Chen for drawing attention and attracting enemies.
 

 
Tong Zhao praised her, “If you can make people hate you, it seems our princess is doing quite well.”
 

 
Consort Chen responded, “It’s manageable.”
 

 
Sister Chu added, “Now Tong Zhao has the persona tag of being lazy and picky; how do you explain that?”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied, “That just means our Zhao Zhao is living well enough to be picky while being lazy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh.
 

 
Her manager was baffled by her laughter and asked if she had lost her mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “Of course not! It was my Fourth Senior Brother’s disciple who got photographed. That day, my master suddenly wanted to eat stinky tofu and oil lamp drum from the market, and I had already drunk two cups of my master’s homemade wine in the morning, so I couldn’t drive. I asked my nephew to take me to buy it; it was all out of kindness.”
 

 
If some baseless gossip and unfounded malice could affect Tong Zhao's mindset...
 

 
Then she shouldn’t be in the entertainment industry and should just pack up and return to business.
 

 
Sister Chu understood and decided to come up with a public relations strategy to let Tong Zhao relax for a couple of days.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt completely at ease, but someone else couldn’t sit still.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked when he saw these reports and photos while surfing the internet. No matter who asked him, he claimed he didn’t know anything about it. How could he be greened if they weren’t even together? It must be that damn paparazzi fabricating stories about his good buddy again! Wei Zekai noticed that Tong Zhao hadn’t mentioned the matter at all, and he felt too shy to ask.
 

 
If he were to ask, wouldn’t it make him seem no different from any other netizen?
 

 
To bring up some baseless rumors and gossip with her?
 

 
This is really outrageous.
 

 
But that night, as he tossed and turned, unable to sleep, Wei Zekai finally couldn’t hold back anymore and secretly sent her a message on WeChat: “Have you started dating?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[So love will disappear, right.jpg]”
 

 
After sending it, he thought it sounded too feminine and quickly added a masculine crying cat emoji.
 

 
Good, that’s the kind of emoji a tough guy should use!
 

 
At that time, Tong Zhao was fast asleep, with her body being played with by Consort Chen.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “Don’t browse through her phone.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “But this is my phone too! Ah, it’s just so bitter to think about it. Back then, when I time-traveled to this backward ancient era, I couldn’t even play with my phone. The biggest entertainment was listening to music. It was even more amusing to watch other concubines perform monkey tricks after entering the palace.”
 

 
That makes sense.
 

 
Even if they have different names, they are essentially the same individual.
 

 
Consort Chen wanted to tease Wei Zekai; she had a good impression of him.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were left to her own devices, it would probably be forty years before anything happened.
 

 
Now, let’s shift the camera to the WeChat page on the phone—
 

 
Tong Zhao: “What, are you very interested in my love life?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I’m not here to gossip.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Then tell me, what did you think when you saw those reports?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I was really angry that they made up stories, but I’m also a bit afraid they might be true.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If it’s true, and you didn’t tell me about such a big thing as starting a relationship, I’d wonder if you don’t see me as a brother anymore, or if I’m the only one who thinks of you as a really important friend.”
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen: “Damn it, what an idiot.”
 

 
Consort Chen threw the phone onto the bed and directly slipped back into her consciousness palace to sleep.
 

 
As for the boy who was eagerly waiting for a response…
 

 
Why should she care about a man’s thoughts? The beautiful woman was puzzled.
 

 
So, when Tong Zhao woke up and checked her phone, she realized she had left Wei Zekai hanging for an entire night.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought he had said something wrong and, feeling aggrieved, apologized to her. Unable to think of a way to cheer her up, he secretly logged into her game account and sent her a screenshot of his eight consecutive victories.
 

 
How should I put it? The thought process of a gamer is quite peculiar.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Fake.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If I were dating someone, I would tell you right away.”
 

 
When Wei Zekai woke up and saw her reply, he felt relieved but also strangely dissatisfied.
 

 
Just as the reporter had thought, those photos didn’t elicit much of a reaction from the fans.
 

 
So what if she was dating?
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t peddling the illusion of romance. Some fans even hoped for fewer boyfriend fans, and some comments seemed rather creepy.
 

 
And then there were those old-fashioned 2G internet users who were completely caught off guard: “What? Isn’t Tong Zhao’s boyfriend Wei Zekai?”
 

 
And even more absurdly: “Doesn’t Tong Zhao have a boyfriend named Han Zhi?”
 

 
Fans couldn’t take it anymore: “That’s still her!”
 

 
Ning Siya couldn’t figure out why the gossip attacks didn’t seem to affect Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s other competitors saw that this “bird standing out” was rather useless—what was the point of attacking her love life? Without understanding where the pain points were, they jumped on the bandwagon, leading public opinion to ferment for an entire afternoon, shifting focus to another point:
 

 
“Rational Discussion: Is Tong Zhao’s effort to create a hard-working persona getting a bit excessive? Has she fallen off in the food variety show?”
 

 
The post scrutinized Tong Zhao’s performance in “Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat” and combined it with the “shopping photos” that had been taken, questioning whether her month of training in seclusion was real or just for show. Similar content appeared on Weibo marketing accounts and various public accounts. It was impossible to trace who initiated the attacks, but it could only be said that Tong Zhao had recently attracted too much attention from the opposing side.
 

 
Even if they could take down her current endorsement, that would be something.
 

 
Seeing these posts didn’t upset Tong Zhao.
 

 
But Consort Chen was quite upset.
 

 
Consort Chen felt wronged: “Isn’t it in line with my persona to be a beautiful, lazy eater? How can that be called ‘falling off’?”
 

 
She didn’t care when people talked about her, but it upset her to see Tong Zhao being poked in the back.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and said, “It’s not your fault; it’s just that there are too many people who hate me.”
 

 
The only way to avoid disputes was to quit the spotlight and stop competing with others.
 

 
By evening, the official Weibo account of the martial arts academy suddenly posted a new update, seriously clarifying recent gossip. However, the focus wasn’t on protecting Tong Zhao; instead, it highlighted the identity of the “mysterious man,” stating that he was Tong Zhao’s apprentice. The accompanying photo showed a spirited young man with a crew cut holding a certain award, smiling brightly and innocently.
 

 
This Weibo post, unlike the usual light-hearted style of Director Deng, used very formal language, and the tone was noticeably angry.
 

 
After posting the formal statement, Director Deng made a private comment that quickly became a hot comment: “That day, I suddenly had a craving for stinky tofu and oil lamp drum, so I ordered them to go to the market to buy it for me. I didn’t expect it to cause such a big fuss [Panda looking aggrieved.JPG].”
 

 
If the focus had been on protecting Tong Zhao, people might have read into it more.
 

 
Fans suddenly understood, and the attention of bystanders shifted to how Director Deng was keeping up with trends and even using memes.
 

 
This was where the matter could have ended.
 

 
Who would take something from a food and entertainment variety show seriously?
 

 
Was it really a black mark for artists to enjoy themselves? That shouldn’t be the case. However, the opposing side didn’t want to miss this opportunity… Sister Chu suspected it was because she was trying to tear up a jewelry endorsement for Tong Zhao, and the chances were quite high.
 

 
The press releases and trending topics were still being arranged; the only way to suppress them was to spend money.
 

 
Those who had been trying to undermine Tong Zhao realized there wouldn’t be any more waves, so they were preparing to give their side some positive publicity when a new development arose.
 

 
It was a promotional video edited by Huashi Sports, featuring Shi Dingjun, Tong Zhao, and the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.
 

 
Huashi Sports V:
 
“The Collision of Entertainment and Traditional Martial Arts: Tong Zhao’s 30 Days at Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.”
# Chapter87
“In the modern city, amidst the hustle and bustle, there lies a classical building hidden in the depths of prosperity. Passersby, upon seeing the century-old plaque, might wonder if it belongs to an expensive private restaurant or a wealthy mansion. However, the residents nearby know that this is the residence of one of the most influential traditional martial arts masters in China and abroad…”
 

 
The opening scene features aerial shots of Qin City, suddenly zooming in on the area around the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
The hurried crowds, fast-forwarded in the footage, slow down in front of the center's outer wall, revealing the cold plum blossoms blooming outside.
 

 
Next is an interview with Elder Deng.
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “This plaque was left to me by my master. It has a history of over a hundred years and was renovated just the year before last. It looks much newer now. Some people advised me to leave it as it was, saying that would make it look like a century-old plaque. I don’t like that; there’s no need. Even if it’s repaired to look brand new, its essence will remain unchanged.”
 

 
Narration: “Elder Deng does not reject new things; however, he hasn’t taken on disciples for a long time.”
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “I’ve had enough disciples. I stopped accepting new ones long ago; it’s all my students who are teaching now.”
 

 
Cameraman: “What about Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Elder Deng squints, looking at Tong Zhao talking with other disciples nearby, his tone becoming light and proud: “She’s particularly talented. I don’t feel at ease letting others teach her.”
 

 
After piquing the audience’s curiosity, the scene shifts to a close-up of Tong Zhao speaking with her disciples.
 

 
Boys, each a head taller than her, listen attentively to her insights on the course content, earnestly calling her “Auntie Master,” creating a somewhat humorous scene. With only her slender brows drawn and a natural light makeup of pink lipstick, she appears to the straight male audience as though she’s naturally beautiful without any embellishment. Even if they can’t understand what she’s saying, they can’t help but be drawn to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Do you understand now?”
 

 
Disciple One hesitantly replies: “I understand…”
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “I think you don’t understand; just jump right in and practice.”
 

 
[There’s a kind of misunderstanding where the master’s niece thinks you don’t understand.]
 

 
[Jumping right in seems fine, though! Hahaha.]
 

 
[So fierce; Tong Zhao must be the only female star who can fall into a den of men without any romantic vibes.]
 

 
[No romantic vibe, but there’s definitely a sense of intimidation…]
 

 
Saying this, the two of them went into the inner area, where the other disciples instinctively surrounded them, creating a large open space.
 

 
Narration: “The martial arts school preserves the tradition of sparring, emphasizing control and restraint. Elder Deng mentioned that there used to be people who would challenge the school, but that hasn’t happened in a long time.”
 

 
A clip followed showing Tong Zhao first using her elbow, then delivering a powerful kick with her left leg, taking down her opponent in quick succession. It is often said that traditional Chinese martial arts use softness to overcome hardness, but all sports emphasize fundamental techniques. This concept is similar to weight classes in sports—different weight categories are used to separate competitors. For example, professional boxing has seventeen distinct weight classes, ranging from heavyweight to mini-flyweight.
 

 
Even Elder Deng couldn’t understand why Tong Zhao had such strength.
 

 
Not only was her power explosive in an instant, but she also had endurance. She could easily handle the wheel battles with her disciples. That’s why, in a short time, she managed to subdue this group of spirited young men, causing them to stop viewing her as a beautiful older sister and instead recognize her as a formidable master who was beyond their capabilities.
 

 
Viewers who saw this couldn’t believe their eyes and rewound the footage several times.
 

 
This was not a sequence designed by a choreographer in advance!
 

 
This was a real fight performed by real people!
 

 
The unwillingness and admiration on the young men’s faces didn’t look like acting.
 

 
The complete episode was uploaded on Huashi TV, primarily to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
Director Deng had many older Chinese fans who all had martial arts dreams but never pursued them due to various real-life reasons, or who had learned when they were younger but later abandoned it. When they saw this girl performing beautiful and smooth martial arts moves on TV and learned she was a star…
 

 
—“In the past, when I suggested you learn martial arts, you thought it was too tough and didn’t go. Look, mastering martial arts can lead to becoming a big star!”
 

 
—“Dad, martial arts has nothing to do with being a star…”
 

 
—“Are our Chinese female stars really this strong now?”
 

 
—“Luzi, come here and tell Dad, has this girl acted in any movies?”
 

 
As the full episode aired simultaneously, similar conversations arose in different households.
 

 
The later content focused on Tong Zhao’s life over the month she spent learning martial arts at the dojo, presenting the seemingly surreal life of martial arts from her perspective. They had a very down-to-earth side: many long-time disciples had become action designers, while those who hadn’t yet graduated were often working part-time jobs that required physical labor, alongside attending night school.
 

 
Tong Zhao would wake up before dawn to make breakfast for Master Deng, persisting day after day for a month, honoring the way of respecting her teacher.
 

 
The day she went to the market to buy snacks for Elder Deng was also documented by the cameraman.
 

 
However, not wanting to attract attention from passersby with a cameraman carrying a long lens, the camera only captured her getting into the car driven by her disciple.
 

 
The rumors and gossip naturally fell apart here—
 

 
That “mysterious man” was someone Tong Zhao had previously mercilessly pinned to the ground!
 

 
Can this be called love?
 

 
She would be better off if her older sister could date, right?
 

 
The complete version aired on television and various video platforms mainly discussed traditional martial arts culture and introduced the dojo. However, the edited version on Weibo understood what online viewers loved to see, highlighting all the exciting moments. Naturally, it included the impressive segments of Tong Zhao taking on her disciples in wheel battles, as well as her quick cuts of waking up early for thirty days, with shots of the breakfast she prepared.
 

 
You could see that although the dishes were simple, they were made with skill.
 

 
This also helped dispel the previous accusations of her being lazy and indulging in pleasures.
 

 
[So what if she relaxed a bit while participating in a variety show themed around food and fun? When she was genuinely learning, she was very willing to wake up early to make breakfast for her master.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao looks like the type who is very filial. I wonder if her deadbeat dad will regret seeing this program. Will his mistress's daughter cook for him every day when he gets old?]
 

 
[I really want to eat the breakfast made by Zhao Zhao!!!]
 

 
...
 

 
However, the hottest topic of discussion was still Tong Zhao defeating her disciples using the martial arts taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Not only were the disciples surprised, but the audience was too.
 

 
It turns out that Tong Zhao could not only fight in instinctive variety shows but was also highly skilled in real life?
 

 
This completely shattered public perception.
 

 
Last time, Tong Zhao showcased her athletic abilities that rivaled muscular men at the promotional event for "One Life Survivor," but actually fighting was a different matter. After all, everyone was used to the subconscious belief that people could achieve things in instinctive movies that they couldn't in reality...
 

 
In real life, an 180 cm tall guy was easily taken down by Tong Zhao?
 

 
[Old man on the subway looking at his phone.jpg]
 

 
Not only could she fight, but she also used the techniques taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Her performance was practically textbook-level in terms of promotional impact—smooth, elegant, and powerful.
 

 
Netizens collectively raised a soul-searching question—
 

 
How many more surprises does this woman have that they don’t know about?
 

 
In the secluded world of Tong Zhao’s home, Xu Zhu felt for the 108th time that Tong Zhao must have been possessed or time-traveled, because she had grown up with Tong Zhao and had no idea she had a martial arts background... or perhaps it was because she had never truly acknowledged her "best friend" or genuinely understood her.
 

 
However, Xu Zhu’s thoughts had become irrelevant to Tong Zhao and the netizens.
 

 
...
 

 
The large-scale, deliberately created doubts had attracted significant attention from netizens.
 

 
Then, just like that, the promotional video released by the official Huashi turned the situation around.
 

 
Wow.
 

 
This wave was free publicity!
 

 
If it hadn’t been for the intense backlash earlier, the effect wouldn’t be so good now. Of course, the credit also went to Tong Zhao's manager, who monitored public sentiment, contacted Elder Deng, and coordinated with Huashi to establish a promotional plan. This not only promoted traditional martial arts but also cleverly clarified the negative rumors while boosting Tong Zhao’s reputation and popularity with the public.
 

 
This was a classic example of public relations that achieved three goals with one shot, elevating Sister Chu’s reputation in the industry. Many artists with contracts ending soon wanted to switch to her management, but she turned down quite a few, saying she couldn’t take them all on.
 

 
In the domestic entertainment industry, while it can feel vast, it can also feel quite small.
 

 
Sister Chu proudly shared her triumph in her social circle:
 

 
[When the retrograde hits, small-minded people swarm around; when it's over, we rise with the momentum! When others ask me if working with artists is hard, I say it is. There's no possibility of a stable routine; fabricated scandals don't adhere to a 9-to-5 schedule, and I often get phone calls at midnight. Plus, there’s one exceptionally talented artist whose invites for variety shows, movies, and TV dramas are so numerous that I couldn’t sort through them even after three sleepless nights. Sigh. Hang in there, hardworking people!】
 

 
The attached photo shows a large stack of documents, with a corner revealing the name "Tong Zhao."
 

 
Everyone knows that Tong Zhao is the most formidable artist under Sister Chu's management.
 

 
This social media post could be considered a modern classic of “humblebragging.”
 

 
This post, pretending to complain but actually showing off, poked at many people's sore spots—
 

 
There are so many who envy Tong Zhao that a few more won’t make a difference. The ones secretly undermining her, especially Ning Siya, were furious after realizing they inadvertently wove her a wedding dress and couldn’t eat all day. Of course, that competitive jewelry endorsement also benefited from this publicity on Huashi, greatly enhancing Tong Zhao's image, allowing her to secure the deal.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s team popped champagne to celebrate, while she just handled the mundane task of taking photos and collecting payment, even giving her manager's post a like.
 

 
Does it do any good to be jealous of her?
 

 
Not at all. When Shi Dingjun started filming "The Knives of the Maiden," Tong Zhao returned to Qin City, where her jewelry advertisement was already prominently displayed at the city’s most prestigious shopping center, with the highest rent and foot traffic.
 

 
With her black hair and snow-white skin, Tong Zhao smiled faintly, her red lips curving slightly.
 

 
Her chin slightly raised, accentuating her beautifully defined jawline, she wore a diamond necklace adorned with large sapphires. Her thick, soft black hair was pulled back, exuding a cold yet beautiful aura. The diamond earrings shaped like snakes hugged her shell-like ears, giving her a unique villainous charm.
 

 
This poster was a performance passionately delivered by Consort Chen.
 

 
She had previously thought about having her portrait hung on the palace walls so that people could see what the most beautiful favored concubine looked like. However, the painter's skills were limited, and she wasn't used to ink portraits. Moreover, the emperor was incredibly jealous, so she gave up.
 

 
Therefore, this endorsement satisfied her vanity.
 

 
No matter how luxurious the cars passing by are or how affluent the pedestrians appear, they must lift their heads to look up at her in the advertisement.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao's entertainment company is directly across from this shopping plaza.
 

 
The people who plotted against her during this incident would have to constantly look up at this strikingly beautiful advertisement…
 

 
As Ning Siya stepped out of the chauffeur-driven car on her way to the company, her eyes immediately caught sight of the advertisement across the street. She squeezed the Starbucks cup in her hand, causing it to crumple slightly. In the lower left corner of the poster was Tong Zhao's signature and her introduction: [Popular Female Star of 20xx].
 

 
Popular female star?
 

 
Ning Siya saw her as an infuriating star!
 

 
...
 

 
Qin City, high-end VIP shooting studio.
 

 
Tong Zhao's holographic shooting pod was separate from the others.
 

 
The other characters were in a large filming studio, which was one of the privileges of being a lead actor.
 

 
"Can we start?"
 

 
After checking the equipment, all the crew members took their places.
 

 
With a command from the director, countless consciousness streams flowed into the device, and the monitoring screens suddenly lit up.
 

 
It was as if they were in another world.
 

 
"The Knives of the Maiden" had a lighthearted tone, beginning with a theft of cultural relics. Dressed in black, with long hair tied in a ponytail, Fu Xuancheng stealthily took an ancient sword and left a new replica next to the safe before elegantly departing. This action choreography was created by Director Deng's sixth disciple, who, despite his honest and sturdy appearance, excelled at fluid martial arts movements. He was humorously nicknamed the "most agile fat guy" by his brothers in the school.
 

 
The same martial arts moves performed by the exceptionally fit rising star Zeng Mingjun appeared suave and charming.
 

 
The supervisor nodded repeatedly, saying, "Your brother's choreography is impeccable; the details are spot on."
 

 
Director Shi lamented, "He couldn’t squeeze in the time to attend classes; the start and end of his movements always feel a bit stiff."
 

 
"There’s no helping it; after all, it's a predetermined program without his personal input."
 

 
The backstage was orderly, monitoring every detail of the film like gods fulfilling their roles, ensuring the world continued to operate smoothly.
 

 
The original footage hadn’t been edited yet.
 

 
However, the director already had an idea in mind: the scene should freeze on the villain Fu Xuancheng leaping on the rooftop, the corners of his trench coat billowing, creating a light-and-shadow silhouette under the moonlight. This shot would be captured by passersby and appear on the front page the next day. Meanwhile, the protagonist Xie Guiya's boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, would excitedly bring this clipping to show off to his girlfriend.
 

 
Tong Zhao entered Cheng Siwen's line of sight, and he saw her walking toward him and sitting down at a milk tea shop.
 

 
Up until this point, everything was fine.
 

 
After Tong Zhao appeared, the supervisor remarked, "I've heard that many TV dramas have sent her scripts, but I think she’s more suited for the big screen. Her figure is truly exceptional; even in this ordinary college casual wear, she still stands out. From the side, her physique is simply different—like a swan among a flock of ducks."
 

 
The assistant director added, "She’s the kind of person who makes you understand why others are background actors while she is the star."
 

 
"Alright, let’s stop before we sound like fans ourselves."
 

 
A few Tong Zhao fans, "lurking" among the crew, were internally cheering.
 

 
In the scene, Cheng Siwen excitedly recounted the modern martial arts-style theft case from the previous night to his girlfriend, along with the silhouette: "It couldn't be wrong; what ordinary thief would dress like that while standing on a rooftop? Look at the agility described; it must be lightness skills!”
 

 
The photo of the master thief standing atop a tall pillar dominated more than half the page.
 

 
In the corner of the society section was a small news piece about seven punks who had suffered varying degrees of minor injuries and were fainting on the side of the street.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was supposed to have a strong aversion to martial arts and heroes, frowned upon hearing her boyfriend's sermon.
 

 
She clearly disagreed with what he was saying.
 

 
In the script, she was supposed to react strongly and refute Cheng Siwen, making him feel deflated.
 

 
However, on screen, Tong Zhao's brows relaxed, and her expression instantly softened: "I think your reasoning, Siwen, makes a lot of sense, and it’s quite interesting."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn't she supposed to start scolding him right away?
 

 
The screenwriter was puzzled.
 

 
Cheng Siwen's eyes lit up at his girlfriend's approval: "Really?"
 

 
"Yes, of course."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded. Her slightly lowered gaze revealed her inner skepticism, but her attitude remained very accommodating as she engaged in a discussion about martial arts with him.
 

 
It's quite common for actors to subconsciously deviate from the script.
 

 
However, no one expected it to happen so quickly. The screenwriter and director discussed it and speculated that Tong Zhao's month-long stay at the martial arts school had significantly increased her acceptance of traditional martial arts, making her subconscious rejection of martial arts something she couldn’t quite reconcile!
 

 
So what should they do now?
 

 
The character designer shook his head: "This is a core setting; it shouldn't be so easily shaken."
 

 
In the next moment, as they left the milk tea shop after paying, Tong Zhao took Cheng Siwen's hand and gently told him that she actually didn't like martial arts and really hated things like heroes. Her tone was warm yet firm, and both Cheng Siwen and the viewers in front of the monitor could clearly feel her resistance and aversion.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was stunned.
 

 
"Then why didn’t you tell me that just now? Why did you let me keep talking?"
 

 
"Because you’re my boyfriend, and you were speaking to me. I wanted to hear you finish and understand your perspective," Tong Zhao's voice was already charming, and in this film, it sounded even more melodious. However, it was not the sultry tone from the time of "The Legend of Ming," but instead carried a neutral, calming, and mysterious power: "Let’s keep things separate; I also want to be honest with you about my views."
 

 
Tong Zhao said, "I really hate martial arts, and heroes shouldn’t exist. I don't accept that."
 

 
She held his hand tightly, her expression focused as she looked at him.
 

 
In her slightly pale eyes lay a world he didn’t know about.
 

 
Director Shi was captivated by her eyes, and a light bulb went off in his head: "I just got inspired! We should give Tong Zhao a close-up here, then transition directly from her eyes to her returning home, facing the man known as the last hero of China, Father Xie!"
 

 
The screenwriter, who wanted to say something but held back: "..."
 

 
Fine.
 

 
As long as the actors want to change things, they can, as long as he doesn’t have to rewrite the script!
 

 
Like traditional films, the status of the screenwriter varies; in "The Knives of the Maiden this particular one was on the lower end, essentially serving as a tool.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Here, Tong Zhao's performance has come full circle. Compared to what she unconsciously improvised, the original plot felt a bit overdone."
 

 
Supervisor: "But the original version would be funnier, right?"
 

 
Assistant Director: "That’s true…"
 

 
The group held differing opinions, but ultimately, there was no disagreement that this way of handling the character would likely create a better first impression for the audience and make her more likable. After all, the protagonist’s strong aversion to martial arts in the early stages might make some Chinese viewers uncomfortable, thinking she was too rebellious. Tong Zhao's way of addressing her rebellious feelings showed her subconscious capacity for tolerance and deep-rooted gentleness.
 

 
Reporters need to think critically, digging deep to uncover the truth hidden beneath a facade of peace.
 

 
However, interrupting the interviewee too often is generally considered taboo.
 

 
Thus, the reporter’s subconscious, despite harboring resentment toward traditional martial arts, would still endure and attentively listen to her boyfriend until he finished speaking.
 

 
There were no problems up to this point.
 

 
After returning home, Tong Zhao happened to see her father, who had been injured while fighting multiple opponents late at night, alone and applying medicinal alcohol. When he saw his daughter return, he let out a loud groan and pretended he couldn’t reach the injury, performing for a while. Noticing that his daughter did not react, he sadly asked, “My daughter, aren’t you going to ask why I’m hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "People who take risks often end up hurt."
 

 
Father Xie: "That wasn’t reckless; I was being a hero."
 

 
Hearing those four words made Tong Zhao’s head throb.
 

 
When she was young, her father was so obsessed with being a vigilante that he neglected her education. Every time Father Xie managed to carve out some time to come home, he never asked about her homework, didn’t accompany her to movies, or care about school matters; he only taught her martial arts. Ironically, she learned quickly and became skilled, which motivated him further, making him feel like he was nurturing the second-best fighter in the martial arts world!
 

 
After their parents divorced, her mother took her brother away, and the father-daughter relationship plunged to an all-time low.
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “Even the leader of the martial arts world can get beaten?”
 

 
“Pfft, a few little brats didn’t even touch my clothes.”
 

 
Father Xie stepped lightly, gracefully landing on the sofa next to Tong Zhao, wearing an expression that said [I’m injured, but I’m just acting]. He looked at his daughter: “Did you see the news? Those seven little brats were harassing a girl in public, and I had to teach them a little lesson. I believe if you had been there, you would have made the same choice as I did.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and chuckled: “I would create a distraction while calling the police; using violence to counter violence is the last resort.”
 

 
…
 

 
Screenwriter: “Originally, I wrote that they would get into an argument here.”
 

 
After discovering that her boyfriend particularly admired vigilantes at the milk tea shop, the protagonist returned home filled with frustration, only to find the source of her real anger was her father’s incessant chatter about being a hero. Her anger instantly doubled, pouring cold water on her father, who had been excitedly trying to improve their relationship.
 

 
The protagonist and her father share similar stubbornness, but their thought processes differ due to their contrasting upbringings.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen did not argue. After returning home, although she sparred verbally with her father, her thoughts were clear, and her speech was coherent.
 

 
Instinctual movies and quick-transitions through books are both susceptible to the butterfly effect.
 

 
Supervisor's Comment: "I think this version of the protagonist is more reasonable; after all, she’s a gifted student from a prestigious university."
 

 
Screenwriter: ‘Covering their face:’ "To be honest, I also think she’s performing very adorably."
 

 
Especially when she gives her dad a little smile; it really hits his soft spot!
 

 
However, just because Tong Zhao offered him a hint of a smile, Father Xie’s lips moved, and he blurted out, “Did you see today’s headline in the social news?”
 

 
The backstage crew, who had been joking around, immediately froze.
 

 
This dialogue should have occurred in at least two scenes later. How could Zhang Jianyi (the actor playing Father Xie) have such a lack of discretion? Just because his daughter smiled at him, he said that? Didn’t he fear that she would get upset and refuse to continue acting? What happened to the buildup?
 

 
Upon hearing this, Tong Zhao indeed stopped smiling.
 

 
Her lightly colored eyes swept over her father, and her brows furrowed, clearly displaying her displeasure and unwillingness to continue this topic.
 

 
But…
 

 
"You go ahead," she said.
# Chapter88
"The mysterious thief must have some remarkable skills in light-footwork," remarked Father Xie.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, "Mm-hmm, and then?"
 

 
Father Xie continued, "Mid-next month is the once-a-decade martial arts conference, and I suspect this is a provocation aimed at that gathering. Last time, there were three attendees—all of whom used the weapons that were just stolen. Especially that sword—only the Plum Blossom Swordsman would use such a noisy weapon like the Yan Wing Saber."
 

 
The Yan Wing Saber has five or more holes on its spine with bronze rings hanging from them. When swung, the rings clatter against the blade, creating a sound much like a wild goose's call. Tong Zhao nodded again, asking, "And what kind of person is the Plum Blossom Swordsman?"
 

 
The crew watched as the protagonist’s father proceeded to spill all the information about this future character, without restraint. He even shared the unknown secret that, ten years ago, the Plum Blossom Swordsman took out a high-interest loan just to replace all the bronze rings on his Yan Wing Saber with gold ones, missing the prime time to buy property. Now, this once-famous swordsman was still renting an apartment. Even the director didn’t know this detail. Director Shi glanced at the screenwriter and said, "You’ve created quite a rich backstory."
 

 
The screenwriter chuckled awkwardly, "I just enjoy adding hidden quirks to characters that might never get discovered."
 

 
The assistant director suggested, "This is a good place to insert a segment showcasing the Plum Blossom Swordsman, with Father Xie’s narration as the voiceover."
 

 
Director Shi agreed, and an assistant immediately added a note to the timeline. Since they weren’t editing as they shot, these notes would make post-production smoother, preventing any fleeting inspirations from slipping away.
 

 
…
 

 
Father Xie, oblivious to how much he'd been prodded into revealing, was delighted, thinking his daughter was finally interested in the martial world.
 

 
Encouraged, he boldly suggested sparring with her.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and refused, heading straight to her room. "I’m not doing something so pointless anymore."
 

 
"How can you call it pointless?" Father Xie looked visibly disappointed.
 

 
"It has meaning for you, so use ‘your’ time on it. But don’t force it onto my life," Tong Zhao said, pausing as she closed the door. With a trace of self-mockery, she added, "That said, I guess I’m stating the obvious, considering all your time has always been spent on this."
 

 
With that, she closed the door, sealing it as firmly as she had her heart.
 

 
In the original script, this scene had the protagonist slamming the door to show her dissatisfaction. However, Tong Zhao’s movements were understated—the door closed gently, blending smoothly into the frame without disturbing even the air. Yet this subtlety conveyed a sense of suffocating restraint, even more intense than if she had slammed the door. The camera followed Tong Zhao as she entered her room and picked up a small wooden dagger on her desk—a “toy” her father had given her as a child. Her childhood had no pretty dolls, no make-believe games; only martial arts and various martial arts-related "toys."
 

 
As a child, in pursuit of her father’s praise, she had trained diligently, displaying an exceptional talent for martial arts.
 

 
Father Xie's enthusiasm was partly fueled by the possibility that his daughter might carry on his legacy.
 

 
On the surveillance screen, Tong Zhao remained silent, her elegant face frozen without expression, as if time had stopped along with the air around her. Even through the screen, the crew could feel the suffocating tension. In the original script, the protagonist had several confrontational scenes early on to establish her character, but Tong Zhao’s subconscious had erased all of them, creating a more layered, subdued, and heartbreaking portrayal of a young woman.
 

 
She didn’t stay silent for long—perhaps only half a minute.
 

 
Yet why was the pressure so intense?
 

 
One perceptive crew member noticed, "She’s gripping the wooden dagger tightly; it’s pressing into her palm."
 

 
"Yes," Director Shi murmured thoughtfully. "Her body language is incredibly expressive."
 

 
As an older director, Shi had trained during the era when traditional films were dominant, studying both representational and method acting. Representational actors use specific expressions, gestures, or props as cues, allowing the audience to understand a character through these signals.
 

 
To use an example from anime, seeing a character with black hair and glasses might immediately bring to mind traits like intelligence or a sly nature. Creators often lean into such stereotypes when building characters.
 

 
But instinctive cinema doesn’t normally use representational methods.
 

 
Tong Zhao, however, was the closest thing to it he had ever seen. She would often employ small, signature gestures to reinforce a character's image. For example, in ‘Emperor Ming’, her consort character habitually took the emperor’s hand and nestled her face into it. Dedicated fans even made a compilation of these moments, noticing that she repeated this gesture almost every time she interacted with him, creating a lasting impression through repetition.
 

 
It was almost like intentional performance.
 

 
Suddenly, Tong Zhao moved.
 

 
Her face remained cold and expressionless, stripped of the gentle facade she showed to others. With surprising speed, she began twirling the wooden dagger in her hand. But the dagger wasn’t enough to release her frustration; with a flick of her wrist, she expertly threw it, landing it perfectly in its stand on her desk. Then, she picked up the sword lying beside her bed…
 

 
A protagonist who despised martial arts, now channeling her anger, executed three full sets of martial arts routines—combining forms from different schools—to vent her frustration.
 

 
This wasn’t in the script, either.
 

 
As she was about to sheath her sword, her father burst into the room, oblivious as always. "Guiya, I made your favorite char siu rice. Don’t be mad—"
 

 
His words trailed off as he froze, staring at his daughter wielding the sword.
 

 
That expression could only be described as, "I walked in and caught Chang Wei attacking Lai Fu."
 

 
‘Chang Wei, you said you didn’t know martial arts?’
 

 
Tong Zhao, you said you didn’t like martial arts?
 

 
Tong Zhao turned back coldly, pursed her lips, and calmly sheathed her sword. “I’ll come out to eat later. Dad, please leave for now; I’m changing.”
 

 
Father Xie was puzzled. “But…”
 

 
His daughter was clearly fully dressed!
 

 
Tong Zhao repeated, using her mesmerizing voice, “I’m changing.”
 

 
“Alright, alright, I’ll leave right now.”
 

 
Indulgent as ever, her father quickly closed the door and left.
 

 
The bedroom returned to silence.
 

 
On screen, a soft pink blush crept onto Tong Zhao’s elegant face, her ears turning red.
 

 
---
 

 
The director and assistant director were deep in discussion about the storyline. Meanwhile, the screenwriter had rolled off to a corner, munching on snacks and complaining to the character designer, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious is incredible at rewriting the story. I’d heard Old Bei mention that she had erased an intricately designed power struggle scene he’d crafted, but I thought that was just a one-time thing. Turns out, this is standard practice for her!”
 

 
Old Bei was the screenwriter for ‘Emperor’s Meng’.
 

 
He’d spent two sleepless nights writing the plot around the Eastern Sea Pearl, sparking a rivalry between two ministers—only for the pearl to be handed off to the consort played by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Screenwriter: “The character model for Xie Guiya is your design, Cheng. You must feel my pain, right?”
 

 
Character designer: “Uh, well…”
 

 
Character designer: “But…isn’t her performance adorable? So…maybe it’s okay?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “?”
 

 
‘When I put a question mark, it’s not that I have a question—I think ‘you’ have a problem.’
 

 
It’s hopeless, bury it.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s practice scene in her room was a small solo martial arts sequence intended to captivate the audience and remind them that this is an action film. Clearly, she delivered. After a month of training, the choreography embedded by the action designer was no longer just a string of rigid moves—it had become an instinctive skill integrated into her subconscious.
 

 
The lead action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ commented, “Luckily, Fu Xuancheng’s lightfoot escape sequence appears first. Otherwise, after seeing the junior sister’s fight scenes, the audience wouldn’t be as captivated by his agility. Compared to her, he’s just performing the moves without depth.”
 

 
Director Shi nodded in agreement. “Her dedication has even earned praise from the masters.”
 

 
Through this brief father-daughter interaction, Xie Guiya’s character was already well-established. Next came a tightly paced dialogue scene, unveiling the movie’s central conflict and introducing the antagonist—Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
In ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, the villain and protagonist are complete opposites.
 

 
Xie Guiya’s mother is a strong and independent woman who, after divorcing her husband, single-handedly raised her son with the child support and her wages, occasionally calling her daughter. In stark contrast, Fu Xuancheng’s mother is a martial artist from a lineage that includes three generations of practitioners of a dark martial arts sect, while his father is a corrupt man involved in gambling, drugs, and other vices. Though his mother had the skills to protect herself, her intense love for her husband made her afraid that standing up to him would lead to his rejection, causing her to tolerate the domestic violence inflicted on her and her children.
 

 
Growing up in a twisted family, Fu Xuancheng’s inner self was like a dark green plant nourished in a swamp.
 

 
Like the protagonist’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, he loved reading martial arts novels. At some point, he even discovered that his mother was one of the legendary figures who knew mystical martial arts. Excited, he went to ask her about it, but instead of praise, he was scolded; his mother forbade him from ever bringing up martial arts again.
 

 
This was because Fu’s father preferred weak women.
 

 
More than that, on the very night that Fu’s mother received a promotion and a raise that put her income slightly above his, he humiliated her to shatter her self-esteem.
 

 
From that point on, Fu Xuancheng realized that his mother had the ability to resist and protect him.
 

 
But she simply chose not to.
 

 
Because her son was merely a tool to keep her husband around.
 

 
At that stage, young Fu did not turn dark; he accepted this logic.
 

 
It wasn’t until Fu’s father was laid off, gambled away his severance pay, got kicked out of an underground casino, drank at a street vendor without paying, and was beaten when he couldn’t cover the bill, that he returned home in disgrace. Furious, he turned on his wife and child who never fought back, yelling, “You think I suffer like this for my own sake?!” Then he beat Fu Xuancheng half to death. At that moment, Fu’s mother, pushed to her limit, resisted for the first time.
 

 
She had gone so long without using her martial arts, and the skills she had were of the most brutal, sinister type.
 

 
In her attempt to stop him, she accidentally killed the man she loved most.
 

 
No one cared about the disappearance of a social outcast like him, and Fu Xuancheng, being so young, had little experience in covering up a crime. He emptied out the refrigerator and struggled to fit his “father” inside. He thought that with his father gone, all their pain would end, that he could finally live a normal life like his classmates. But after he had healed, he came home from school one day to find his mother hanging from the ceiling.
 

 
She had followed the man she loved into another world.
 

 
So what was he left to be?
 

 
When the neighbors called the police due to the stench, and social workers came to take Fu Xuancheng away, he was still unable to understand. Desperate for answers, he searched frantically through his mother’s belongings and found the manual for her sinister martial arts techniques.
 

 
His views were the opposite of the heroine’s.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng believed his mother was completely wrong.
 

 
If she had wanted to keep his father, she should have subdued him with force from the start. Leaving a powerful weapon unused and hoping that love would change him was putting the cart before the horse.
 

 
Martial arts novels often touch on the question of wielding power for control or submission—
 

 
When such discussions arise, they pull the reader from the fantastical world of martial arts back to reality. But if they don’t discuss it, the stories feel somewhat unrealistic.
 

 
Under the influence of the dark martial arts manual, Fu Xuancheng’s ambitions became old-fashioned and somewhat out of place. He dreamed of unifying the martial arts world and becoming its supreme leader. Ironically, in modern times, almost no one practices martial arts; even fitness-based martial arts gyms—which lack any real martial arts skill—see barely any customers.
 

 
In the end, he would be unifying an empty, lonely world.
 

 
Two years ago, a so-called "grandmaster" claimed to be the head of the Xingyi Tai Chi sect. Fu Xuancheng, eager for a fight, raced to his door under the cover of night (by high-speed rail). It turned out the man was a fraud, just another con artist. Disappointed, Fu defeated him and returned home, resolving from then on to seek out real "martial artists," intent on challenging them to truly unify the martial arts world...
 

 
The actor playing Fu Xuancheng, Jiang Dang, is known for his eccentric personality in real life, endearingly nicknamed the "crazy beauty" by his fans. Jiang has a rather unusual mindset.
 

 
Reporters find it hard to interview him because he often seems lost in his own world, sporting a mischievous yet alluring smile while barely responding to questions. Fortunately, he’s well-behaved when it comes to reading the PR scripts his agent prepares for him. He’s managed to stay scandal-free, but his recent puzzling “scandal” came when he starred in a romance drama with a new actress. The variety show they later appeared on together had accepted a favor from the actress’s agent, hoping to create a romance buzz around them. No matter what he asked, the editing team planned to spin it as “cute” chemistry.
 

 
But his question was, “Do you think tomatoes really like being paired with scrambled eggs as a national favorite?”
 

 
By afternoon, the internet exploded, with fans assuming Jiang was shading the actress for trying to force a “couple” image with him. Later that evening, paparazzi reported that Jiang had ordered a simple boxed meal for dinner: tomato and scrambled egg over rice.
 

 
Well, that escalated quickly.
 

 
Fans abandoned the intended romance storyline and instead debated whether Jiang’s emotional intelligence might have been entirely spent on his beauty.
 

 
In the story, Fu Xuancheng arrives in Qin City to search for any remaining “martial artists.” He creates a series of sensational stunts, hoping to draw them out. His main target is none other than the last rumored “hero of China”—the heroine’s father.
 

 
But will these antics draw in the heroine?
 

 
The answer is no. It’s her boyfriend who takes the bait.
 

 
The screenwriter brags, “This move, you see, is a masterful way of sneaking around to our goal!”
 

 
The character designer gives him a slap on the back of the head, “Please, stop butchering idioms like that.”
 

 
Screenwriter: QAQ
 

 
So what exactly does Jiang Dang’s Fu Xuancheng do?
 

 
Under the screenwriter’s omnipotent guidance, every time Fu Xuancheng makes a scene, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen just happen to be there.
 

 
For instance, when Fu shatters the face of the iconic clock tower—Qin City’s prime dating spot—by shooting an arrow in broad daylight, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen are holding hands right below it. Shattered glass falls dangerously close to Cheng, but Tong swiftly pulls him into her arms, saying, “Be careful.”
 

 
The arrowhead is deeply embedded in the clock face.
 

 
Tong looks towards the direction the arrow came from, but all she catches is a glimpse of a trench coat vanishing around the corner.
 

 
Cheng’s eyes light up with excitement, eager to investigate. However, knowing his girlfriend dislikes his fascination with all things martial arts, he restrains himself. Only after seeing Tong home does he race back to the clock tower, channeling his inner detective and asking around if anyone has seen a man in a trench coat. By chance, he ends up asking Fu Xuancheng himself (minus his “getaway” trench coat).
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked, "Did you see the person who shot the arrow?"
 

 
Cheng Siwen shook his head honestly. "No, I didn’t. That’s why I want to find him!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked why he was so interested, noting that Cheng seemed far too innocent to be a police officer.
 

 
Cheng eagerly shared his thoughts, convinced the mysterious archer must be a true hero. "McCarthy said, 'If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it’s a duck.'"
 

 
“You really have a lot of free time,” Fu Xuancheng remarked with a sigh, then added, “But if you find him, what do you plan to do? What if he’s actually a bad guy?”
 

 
The two chatted aimlessly for a while. Perhaps Fu Xuancheng hadn’t had a casual conversation in a long time, or maybe Cheng’s guileless nature simply made people feel at ease. Fu eventually confessed, “I, too, am searching for real heroes in this city. I believe they’re out there.”
 

 
Someone like him.
 

 
Cheng nodded excitedly, thrilled to have found someone who shared his thoughts. This wasn’t just a random stranger; this was a kindred spirit!
 

 
Since the other person was a man, Cheng didn’t worry about his girlfriend getting jealous... although he had never actually seen her get jealous. She was always warm and gentle, occasionally patting his head affectionately.
 

 
After an awkward but heartfelt exchange, Cheng reluctantly left, casting longing glances over his shoulder, completely unaware that he’d just escaped a dangerous situation.
 

 
...
 

 
Originally, this scene was supposed to be Fu Xuancheng meeting the heroine. However, after some discussion, the crew felt it wouldn’t work.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s incredible ability to extract information, the actor playing Fu, Jiang Dang, would likely end up spilling every detail of his life, including his birthday and first love’s name. It felt much safer to send Cheng Siwen, with his innocent, straightforward nature. Unintentionally, the secondary male lead had become the perfect "tool" character, and the assistant director who recommended him to the team felt immensely proud.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s next move involved inviting a professor at the heroine’s university to create a calligraphy piece of the phrase “Invincible Solitude.”
 

 
In the classroom at that time, Cheng Siwen had woken up late and, sensing something was off, quickly ducked back down. Because he was lying in the last row, he only caught a quick glimpse before hiding, so Fu didn’t notice him.
 

 
This incident would later create a plot twist during a scene where they try to identify each other.
 

 
But then, the butterfly effect began to unfold.
 

 
The journalist Shuyi had long anticipated that her boyfriend’s curiosity about the "mysterious thief" would likely get him into trouble. She was far more attentive to him than her script required. With meticulous detail, she checked his class schedule and, noticing he hadn’t responded for a while after class, decided to look for him. She ended up running straight into the professor, who was being forced to write calligraphy, and Fu Xuancheng!
 

 
The first fight scene was about to erupt—
 

 
Screenwriter: “So, does this mean the character recognition scene I designed is scrapped again?”
 

 
Character Modeler: “Looks like it.”
 

 
Screenwriter: “Damn it.”
 

 
The screenwriter was frustrated, but then realized that this would be an impromptu fight scene, unscripted and unplanned by the action choreographer. This meant Shuyi’s moves would come entirely from her subconscious.
 

 
Without the guidance of a fight choreographer, most actors simply can’t pull off a convincing fight scene—this is widely acknowledged in the industry.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng is, after all, a grown man. Even without planned moves, he should be able to handle a young woman easily, right? The screenwriter knew that Shuyi had some martial arts training, but the difference in strength was still significant.
 

 
Director Shi frowned, sensing trouble. “Quick, come up with a reason why Fu Xuancheng can’t use his full strength! Have a passing student call the police, so we can wrap this up sooner!”
 

 
He needed to justify why Fu Xuancheng wouldn’t be able to defeat the not-yet-awakened heroine without disrupting the plot entirely.
 

 
Director Shi had seen Tong Zhao sparring with her junior disciples at the martial arts studio and knew her skills were extraordinarily sharp. But please, just don’t let her defeat the villain boss here and now!
 

 
…
 

 
The backstage crew was in chaos. On set, the dim classroom was lit only by natural light from the large windows, casting long shadows of Fu Xuancheng and Shuyi, creating a beautifully dramatic composition.
 

 
Shuyi immediately pulled out her phone to call the police.
 

 
But before she could press 110, a flying sword sliced through the air toward her, forcing her to dodge to the side.
 

 
“Oh?” Fu Xuancheng’s interest was piqued.
 

 
…
 

 
The assistant director was nervous. “We need to make Shuyi afraid somehow… this isn’t the right moment for dialogue between them! Can the modeler come up with something?”
 

 
“Absolutely,” the modeler replied confidently.
 

 
To handle various unexpected situations, the modeler had prepared numerous emergency codes.
 

 
…
 

 
Shuyi studied him.
 

 
He had a striking, devilishly handsome face. His high-bridged nose and thin lips gave him the classic look of a male lead in a novel, while his narrow, phoenix-like eyes flashed with an unsettling intensity that sent chills down one’s spine. Of course, while ‘Instinct’ could blur the line with reality, it couldn’t convey hundreds of words of internal monologue through a single flicker in someone’s gaze. However, inducing a shiver was much easier.
 

 
Under the influence of a pre-set program from the “Hand of God” crew, Shuyi’s back cooled perceptibly as Fu Xuancheng fixed his gaze on her with interest.
 

 
Huh?
 

 
An ordinary subconscious mind might have interpreted that sensation as fear.
 

 
After all, feeling a chill while facing a dangerous figure is a normal physiological response.
 

 
But Shuyi’s subconscious wasn’t afraid.
 

 
Though she didn’t know why and didn’t dwell on the reason, she simply didn’t fear the unknown threat in front of her. It felt as if she’d faced far graver dangers countless times, confronting ruthless warlords or shielding the defenseless from gunfire. Her principle was always to stand on the side of the vulnerable, of reason, and of justice.
 

 
Any physiological reactions the crew tried to trigger in her to provoke confusion or fear couldn’t stir even a hint of dread in her.
 

 
Not only did she refuse to retreat—she took a step forward and asked:
 

 
“Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want?”
# Chapter89
Who am I?
 

 
Where am I?
 

 
What should I do?
 

 
If this isn't an interrogation of a criminal, these three questions could even be quite philosophical, like the question a teacher asks students when choosing a career — what are your life goals? You probably need to first understand why we live before talking about life goals, and that's a never-ending question, something that could make you think for three hours while sitting on the toilet. Fortunately, most of us don't overthink it. Instead, we straightforwardly fill in a university's name as our life goal, and for work, there's a standard, one-size-fits-all answer: become a government official.
 

 
Unfortunately, Jiang Dang, the actor playing Fu Xuancheng, belongs to the type of person who tends to overthink.
 

 
Faced with this inquiry, he began thinking!
 

 
But while thinking, he also spoke: "You can dodge my throwing knives. You're not an ordinary person."
 

 
Shuyi denied it: "I'm just an ordinary college student with good physical fitness."
 

 
"Really? I don't believe it."
 

 
After saying that, Fu Xuancheng let go of the poor professor, his figure blurred, and in an instant, he was in front of Shuyi.
 

 
In films, the things martial arts can do are exaggerated for effect.
 

 
But the fundamentals remain the same.
 

 
It's like actors learning to swim—though the butterfly stroke remains the same, in an action movie, they can swim with the speed of a speedboat. Fu Xuancheng was fast, but Shuyi wasn’t slow either. Her dynamic vision clearly tracked his approaching trajectory, and she seized his arm, throwing him to the ground…
 

 
Without the support of a stunt module, Fu Xuancheng had the strength and speed, but he was unable to react in time or use his "high-level martial arts" to counter.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's mood was one of shock.
 

 
However, since his emotions and expressions often went off-kilter, his cold and handsome face remained calm as he looked up at Shuyi from below.
 

 
Shu Yi: "Please answer my question."
 

 
In the gentlest and most polite tone, she did the most brutal thing.
 

 
When investigating abused animals that couldn’t speak, Shu Yi frequently used her self-created "physical interrogation" method to get answers. After all, gentleness and respect are reserved for those who deserve it, while unrepentant criminals don’t need such treatment… In this regard, she might be a little "immoral."
 

 
...
 

 
The template master was sweating nervously: "This isn't working. Conventional reasons can’t deter Tong Zhao. She’s not afraid of the villain at all."
 

 
Does this scene need to be reshot?
 

 
A reshoot might make it even worse, since something that wasn’t scary the first time will only seem even more indifferent the second time in such a short period.
 

 
So, they had to give the villain a reason not to take action against the protagonist.
 

 
The sunset's fading glow cast its light over the two of them.
 

 
Director Shi thought for a moment: "If physiological reactions can't affect Tong Zhao, let's have the villain make the first move. Could that make Fu Xuancheng feel something for the protagonist?"
 

 
Other staff members exchanged looks of disbelief, thinking, ‘Is that even possible?’
 

 
No wonder he's a veteran director with experience in over ten instinctual films; his ability to think on his feet is outstanding.
 

 
Template Master: "I'll give it a try."
 

 
After all, there's nothing more difficult than manipulating Tong Zhao's subconscious!
 

 
---
 

 
Fu Xuancheng froze for about two or three seconds, while Shuyi kept her knee pressed on his arm. She turned to the professor and asked, "Professor, did he do anything to you?"
 

 
In Shuyi's mind, this was simply a villain attacking a university professor.
 

 
The professor's voice trembled, mixed with confusion: "He asked me to write a calligraphy for him, the content was 'Dugu Qiubai'..."
 

 
---
 

 
Where did this "garden baby" come from? Shuyi was speechless.
 

 
Then, the temporary code input by the template master took effect. Fu Xuancheng, who had been staring at Shuyi in astonishment, suddenly felt his heartbeat race and dopamine rush through him, making him feel a nonsensical sense of happiness. Under the influence of the bridge effect and dopamine, he couldn’t help but raise his left hand, which was not being controlled, to touch his chest to confirm the change in his heartbeat, but Shuyi, quick to react, caught his other hand.
 

 
Shuyi narrowed her eyes slightly.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, looking somewhat shy, said, "Do you want to hold my hand?"
 

 
In the back, the original partner Cheng Siwen, who had been watching this from the start: "?"
 

 
He thought this warrior had a problem, and it was a big one!
 

 
The crew didn’t expect this.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had mostly played the second male lead in idol dramas before, typically as the villain, where all he needed to do was display his handsome, wicked-looking face and deliver his lines. He didn’t need to immerse himself deeply into the role, nor had he ever tried to make the audience feel the rush of love through physiological means.
 

 
Everyone was caught off guard by how this guy was reacting...
 

 
Shuyi furrowed her brows: "I don’t want you to move around. I’ll tell the police later."
 

 
"No," Fu Xuancheng refused. "Although you're very cute, I can't let the police catch me."
 

 
After subduing the villain, a normal person's rational response would be to call the police immediately.
 

 
However, Shuyi’s subconscious was a bit different. She was more concerned with another matter: "Then tell me your purpose."
 

 
"You know martial arts. I can’t tell what style it is, but you practice well."
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's lips curled into an ambiguous smile, even a little flirtatious, as though he'd finally found someone special in a sea of people, and that someone was like him. Was there anything more joyful than this? Probably not.
 

 
He continued to speak to himself:
 

 
"I didn’t expect the person I was looking for to be such a young girl. Who's your master? I'd like to spar with you properly, but this place is obviously not suitable." He wore an expression of regret.
 

 
"I don’t know martial arts. I just have a healthy exercise routine.”
 

 
Shuyi emphasized again.
 

 
By pure chance, Shuyi's curiosity was piqued by this neurotic person who loved to chat a lot and make grand gestures. Her intuition told her that this was no ordinary madman. The two of them were about to continue talking, but at that moment, Cheng Siwen once again displayed his exceptional potential as a tool man. He...
 

 
He secretly sent a WeChat message to his classmates, asking them to bring over more security guards.
 

 
At this moment, with both the villain and the protagonist acting out at the same time, what a rare "normal person" Cheng Siwen was! The crew couldn’t help but sigh in relief, thinking that simplicity and peace are truly a blessing. The combination of a madman and a master of conversation could easily turn an action movie into a philosophical art film.
 

 
As the villain, Fu Xuancheng had much higher combat power than the protagonist in the early stages.
 

 
This could make up for his lack of technique.
 

 
Excited, he finally broke free from Shuyi's control and rolled over to engage in the first fight scene with her —
 

 
It was like an impromptu free-fight match without any weight class. Shuyi didn't want to kill him, and Fu Xuancheng didn't want to hurt her either, so the fight wasn't full of deadly blows. Instead, it was quite a spectacle. Her movements were agile, and despite her opponent having a slight physical advantage, she didn't fall behind. After being knocked down once, before Fu Xuancheng could take advantage of the situation, she performed a light and nimble kip-up, her waist arching as she sprung up. The short white T-shirt she wore lifted slightly, revealing a toned and tight abdomen, showcasing her strength and beauty.
 

 
---
 

 
The action choreographer's eyes remained glued to the scene, afraid to blink in case he missed even a moment: "Her moves are so perfect, no wonder she was personally trained by her master. Compared to her, Jiang Dang is just using brute force with the help of the coded 'golden finger.'"
 

 
The supervisor shifted his gaze to the director.
 

 
The one most passionate about action scenes here was Director Shi.
 

 
"I can't wait to start editing," Director Shi said, indicating that even he was impressed by Tong Zhao's fight scenes.
 

 
The raw, unedited footage looked a little chaotic because the real fight was intense, every punch landing with force, creating an exhilarating feeling. But through camera work and some montage techniques, they could highlight the elegant beauty of the movements.
 

 
However, they didn’t have much time to enjoy the fight scene. The security guards Cheng Siwen had called for were almost there. The two fighters heard the approaching footsteps in the hallway and the students' insistent calls: "Yes, it's this way!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng didn’t give her a chance to stop him. He quickly closed the distance, jumped lightly to the window, and as he did, he casually yanked out the hair tie holding her ponytail.
 

 
The hair tie fell into his hand, and Shuyi’s long hair tumbled down, the strands fanning out in an arc, unknowingly providing the director with a perfect shot. She looked up at him, and the disheveled hair added a softness to her previously cold demeanor.
 

 
Her coat fluttered in the wind, and the sunset had completely set behind the mountains.
 

 
The darkness swallowed half of his face, but the eye on his right side locked onto Shuyi: "Unfortunately, this is where our fight ends today. But I’m sure... you’re one of the people I’ve been looking for. I hope the next time we meet, we can fight until one of us is dead."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a light sparring?
 

 
Fu Xuancheng: "You must be a martial arts genius, just like me."
 

 
Shuyi: "..."
 

 
Favorability: -1-1-1.
 

 
She was too tired to explain that she was simply good at sports and had no martial arts skills at all!
 

 
With time running out, Fu Xuancheng kissed the hair tie, then leaped away with light steps, disappearing from the third floor.
 

 
The security guards and classmates almost arrived at the same time.
 

 
Cheng Siwen, who had gotten up from the back row, tugged at his girlfriend’s hand with a resentful expression, feeling a bit green, but Shuyi quickly reassured him with a few words, lifting his spirits again. He then turned his attention to another matter: "By the way, Guiya, so you’re really that good at fighting? What you used just now was Xingyi Quan, right?"
 

 
"It was the military boxing taught during military training."
 

 
"I saw it clearly—it wasn’t military boxing..."
 

 
"Then you must have seen it wrong."
 

 
Shuyi said decisively, her firm expression convincing her boyfriend.
 

 
...
 

 
At this point, the plot had already taken off like a wild horse, never to return.
 

 
But the protagonist was still doing what they were supposed to be doing, walking down what seemed to be the right path.
 

 
After a discussion, the core team of the crew felt that the changes were acceptable. Aside from the writer feeling a little emotionally slighted, the plot was moving forward as planned, and the three lead actors had unexpected interactions and chemistry. The key was that there were several scenes that the director thought would be a waste to reshoot. He and the team already had a rough idea for how to edit the footage in post-production.
 

 
"The only remaining issue is when to trigger Tong Zhao’s subconscious shift; there needs to be a catalyst."
 

 
As the discussion was winding down, the first portion of the shoot came to an end.
 

 
Since ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ has a significant time span within the storyline, for the health of the actors, the crew didn’t want to rush the actors and decided to set up some rest periods. The actors could wake up and rest in the studio dorms after they finished filming.
 

 
The lead actors woke up from the filming cabin.
 

 
Shuyi was a bit tired, so she directly handed over the position of the main personality to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned to her room to rest, she noticed that someone from the crew group had added her as a friend—
 

 
Jiang Dang?
 

 
He was the actor playing the antagonist.
 

 
"Why did he add me?"
 

 
After returning to her room, Tong Zhao accepted the request while casually saying this.
 

 
Consort Chen: [Maybe he wants to make a move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need for that.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Do you remember Song Wanzhuo? Maybe something happened between you two in the film, and its effect carried over into real life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment but felt that it didn’t seem quite right.
 

 
Jiang Dang wasn’t new to playing in instinct-based films; this kind of “getting into character” situation should be something he could handle himself—this was also a problem that many on-screen couples faced. The feeling of attraction generally faded away after filming wrapped: [Besides, he's the antagonist, not the male lead, and Shuyi isn't a concubine. She doesn’t “keep fish.”]
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, Director Shi sent a message and a sample file.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [Because of adjustments to the plot, we’ve added a romantic scene between you and Jiang Dang.]
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [There’s also another plot point that will need your second type of subconscious. Can you handle it?]
 

 
...
 

 
This was actually happening.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with a simple "Okay."
 

 
As soon as she sent the message, Jiang Dang’s WeChat call came through.
 

 
Was there something that couldn’t be typed out?
 

 
It was just a professional relationship, and Tong Zhao was a bit patient with him, so she answered the call and greeted him in a cheerful voice meant for fans: “Brother Dang, what’s up?”
 

 
Jiang Dang had debuted earlier than her, so using his full name felt a bit too unfamiliar... The entertainment industry, like any other network-based industry, often made it safe to address others with titles like "sister" or "brother."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I guess I shouldn’t be disturbing you at this time."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, indeed.
 

 
But Jiang Dang had an irresistibly seductive voice.
 

 
Even if she wasn’t a "voice person," just hearing him speak could instantly erase any irritation.
 

 
Every syllable was soft and lingering, even when he said something as ordinary as "Did you eat?" It felt like he was whispering sweet nothings. While ordinary people’s words vibrated in the ear, his voice slid past like a gentle caress...
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her ears tingle.
 

 
Jiang Dang spoke slowly, as if he couldn’t quite find the right words: "I don’t know why, but after I woke up from the cabin, I felt this strong urge to find you. I just had to find you."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't help but inwardly hiss.
 

 
Shuyi: [Is this my turn now?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Looks like our Shuyi has leveled up.]
 

 
“I wanted to ask if you have some free time. I really want to spar with you…”
 

 
It was as if he suddenly remembered something inappropriate to say, and his deep voice took on a shy tone, adding a touch of unspoken allure.
 

 
Could this be the legendary “let’s find a time to hook up” invitation?
 

 
Too direct, too forward.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect.
 

 
After all, “sex and food are human nature." While she wasn’t someone who easily got into relationships, she admired the other person’s frankness. It was a genuine, straightforward approach.
 

 
Consort Chen’s comment: [That kid, Wei, should learn from him. They could have had a couple of kids by now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What does this have to do with Zekai?]
 

 
Consort Chen smiled behind her fan and said nothing.
 

 
On the other end, Jiang Dang finally made up his mind and made a bold request to the female star he had just met:
 

 
"Would you spar with me?”
# Chapter90
“...Huh?”
 

 
Even Tong Zhao was momentarily stunned.
 

 
At her age, she had never heard of such a request.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If you really need something, you can discuss it with your manager first.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s words were somewhat tactful.
 

 
Mainly, because the two weren’t familiar with each other, she didn’t feel comfortable suggesting that he see a psychiatrist. But based on the movie script, his desire to fight seemed to be an impulsive moment. Once he talks to his manager, he’d probably calm down and realize how ridiculous he was being.
 

 
“Could it be...”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was more confused now. “Tong Zhao, do you think I’m not worthy of being your opponent by myself, and want me to bring my manager for a two-on-one?”
 

 
...
 

 
Well, well, well. Tong Zhao silently thought to herself.
 

 
She had been trained to be professional and managed to suppress the urge to laugh, but the other personalities in her mind were on the verge of cracking up.
 

 
Before she could steady herself and speak, Jiang Dang suddenly had an epiphany: “Ah, I get it now. I knew it.”
 

 
Well, if you understand...
 

 
Jiang Dang: “You want to bring my manager in as a referee, right?”
 

 
You understand ‘nothing’!
 

 
Tong Zhao tightened her grip on the phone, her fist clenching.
 

 
“We might cause rumors if we attend the same event together, so it’s better to discuss it with the manager first.”
 

 
Her side was quite relaxed; she just needed to report things.
 

 
Her manager didn’t restrict her socializing, but the whole team worked hard for her image, so naturally, it was her responsibility to cooperate and trust them to the fullest.
 

 
“Then it’s settled. Thank you.”
 

 
After Jiang Dang finished speaking, he quickly hung up the phone.
 

 
...
 

 
Huh?
 

 
It’s settled?
 

 
What kind of train of thought does this person have?
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, are you really going to fight him?]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Fighting a demon might be worth considering.]
 

 
[No,] Tong Zhao quickly stopped the wild idea from the consort, saying: [Actually, it’s not impossible… I mean, a fight, just as practice. I’ve fought with my junior disciples in the dojo before.]
 

 
Tong Zhao mentioned it to her manager.
 

 
Sister Chu was also stunned.
 

 
However, Jiang Dang’s reputation for being unconventional in the industry wasn’t surprising. Sister Chu said on the phone, “Maybe he’s interested in you. It depends on how you feel about him. I won’t interfere with that. Although his personality is a bit odd, it’s hard to resist someone with his looks and voice.”
 

 
Jiang Dang was one of the rare amphibious artists in the younger generation. His singing was more famous than his acting, and he became famous through his music.
 

 
It was said that when he first debuted, he wasn’t as eccentric.
 

 
There was a rumor in the industry that Jiang Dang loved singing so much that his manager once told him that in order to be a professional singer, he needed to speak less and protect his voice. After two years, when he became an overnight sensation, his manager, thinking that he was now a big star and should have the image of an idol, told him that it was fine if he talked more.
 

 
Once that seal was broken, there was no turning back.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s best-selling album became a hit all across Asia.
 

 
The promotional poster for this album features him wearing a soaked white shirt, his hands cuffed with a pair of silver handcuffs, and the lower half of his face firmly restrained by a black leather muzzle designed for vicious dogs. His naturally sinister face carries an indifferent expression, as if hiding a thousand-word love song behind his dark, wet eyes. The photographer adjusted the lighting to make the faintest hint of light shine in his eyes, adding an intense, unspoken depth to the emotion, as if he were struggling to hold it in.
 

 
Later, when asked what he was thinking while shooting this poster, Jiang Dang said, “The lighting technician seemed to want to shine the light directly into my eyes. I wanted to complain to my manager, but my mouth was covered by the muzzle.”
 

 
Countless fans fantasized about what kind of charming love words this fierce dog might speak.
 

 
Who could have imagined that, in the end, it would turn into a whole lot of dog talk.
 

 
Sister Chu said she bought the album and even saved the high-definition image of the poster to send to Tong Zhao. Since entering the industry, Tong Zhao had seen so many handsome men and beautiful women that she had become somewhat numb to them. The one who most matched her aesthetic was still Han Zhi in her mind. She wasn’t particularly moved by Jiang Dang’s looks and, after the phone call earlier, she began to think that he might not be that smart.
 

 
But he wasn’t like a Husky either.
 

 
Wei Zekai had more of that Husky vibe.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and pushed the thought aside.
 

 
...
 

 
So, what exactly was Jiang Dang’s reasoning behind making such a bold request?
 

 
At the time, he had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and the influence of his character Fu Xuancheng still lingered in his mind. However, the effect was minimal, something most actors would just ignore and laugh off. But Jiang Dang was no ordinary person. He was someone who acted on impulse, and after giving it some thought, he didn’t see anything unreasonable about the request.
 

 
A fight? What a perfectly legitimate invitation.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao "agreed" to his request, he was satisfied.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to consult with his manager, he obediently did so. — Fans liked to call him a "crazy beauty," but that wasn’t entirely accurate. Jiang Dang was actually quite willing to follow the rules; he just sometimes acted a little thoughtlessly, making him seem a bit wild in the rational, interest-driven entertainment industry.
 

 
After hearing his report, his manager fell silent for a moment. “Sorry, Jiang Dang, could you repeat what you want to do?”
 

 
He suspected his ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied in a particularly cheerful tone, “I want to spar with her!”
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, so it’s just that his artist has lost his mind. Well, that’s nothing unusual.
 

 
The manager knew he was filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ at the moment, so he advised, “Calm down. Don’t get too immersed in your character. She’s the last direct disciple of Director Deng! Even a 1.8-meter tall man can’t beat her. Have you studied martial arts?”
 

 
“Nope!” Jiang Dang replied in the same cheerful, refreshing tone.
 

 
The manager sighed heavily. “...You’ll get beaten to death!”
 

 
From his understanding of Jiang Dang, once the guy had a weird idea, he would become stubborn about it. The manager didn’t want to argue further, so he decided to find a chance to talk to Tong Zhao, pleading with her not to injure him too badly, or at least avoid hitting him in the face. If she could silence him, that would be great... No, wait, that wouldn’t work either—there was a concert scheduled mid-year, and his voice couldn’t be ruined.
 

 
Coincidentally, Jiang Dang’s manager, Aaron, had some connections with Sister Chu, so arranging this wouldn’t be a hassle.
 

 
Back to the filming work.
 

 
The actor playing the male lead’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, was a normal guy who didn’t have as much drama as Jiang Dang. He held a simple “the more friends, the more paths” philosophy and added Tong Zhao as a friend, then quietly laid low.
 

 
After resting for the entire day, everyone returned to holographic filming the next day, fully recharged and ready to go.
 

 
The villain Fu Xuancheng became entangled with the protagonist, played by Shuyi, and wanted to spar with her.
 

 
But she chose to blend into the crowd and avoid the fight, not even returning home.
 

 
During her entanglement with Fu Xuancheng, Shuyi, who believed that everything had an answer, proactively reached out to the so-called "martial artists." She encountered the Plum Blossom Swordsman, who, facing a midlife crisis, spoke with shining eyes when talking about his knife. He mentioned that if he saw his students studying too late and there was no one to accompany them home, he would secretly follow them using his lightness skill. Once, he was mistaken for a creepy stalker, and he had to work hard to escape the situation...
 

 
Gu Xiaopan, a descendant of the famous martial artist Jianghu Bai Xiaosheng, was a serious recluse. Even when food delivery arrived, she wouldn’t dare make eye contact with the delivery driver, insisting in her notes that the food be placed in a plastic basket by the door.
 

 
But she still knew a lot of information.
 

 
This was because Gu Xiaopan, though timid in real life, was a force to be reckoned with online.
 

 
Not only did she teach these older martial artists how to use computers and WeChat over the phone, but she also gained much information from the internet. By hacking into various surveillance systems, she narrowed down Fu Xuancheng’s movements.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan’s computer was filled with PSD files of “martial arts manuals.”
 

 
These used to be passed down only to trusted individuals.
 

 
Now, due to necessity, she had no choice but to share them, afraid that they would be lost forever.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan said, “I told the uncles and aunties that as long as the files are saved on the computer, they’ll last as long as the heavens and the earth. I have one copy on the cloud, one on the computer, and three more stored on different solid-state drives, all kept in a waterproof safe.”
 

 
Becoming a martial artist is too hard—practicing stances is no different from attending hobby classes.
 

 
After all, knowing lightness skill won’t give you extra points on the college entrance exam, and it can’t stop bullets or make you an outlaw. People like Fu Xuancheng and the protagonist are rare talents, one in a million.
 

 
The most important thing is that it doesn’t make money!
 

 
When the time and effort invested doesn’t bring proportional returns, the skill will disappear.
 

 
If no one learns it, what’s the difference from it being lost?
 

 
There are many types of urban knights, each with a different appearance.
 

 
The one thing they all have in common is their love for martial arts.
 

 
After the guerrilla warfare in the girls’ dormitory, Fu Xuancheng could no longer contain himself and made his move on Cheng Siwen.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was kidnapped to an abandoned school, where Fu Xuancheng forced him to send a message to the protagonist, luring her to come alone. After Cheng Siwen firmly refused, Fu Xuancheng had no choice but to send her a voice message—due to his father’s deliberate abuse, he hadn’t attended school much and could only recognize a few characters. At the time, he only understood the movements and principles in the secret martial arts manual.
 

 
He didn’t understand the warning left by previous masters, telling him not to learn it.
 

 
This was a turning point in the protagonist’s character arc, where, in the process of using the martial arts taught by his father to protect important people, he also came to accept that he actually loved martial arts.
 

 
As the protagonist saw her boyfriend injured, she was also provoked by Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
Just then, filming paused.
 

 
...
 

 
All the actors were still in a deep sleep, except for Tong Zhao, who had woken up.
 

 
A staff member thoughtfully handed her a warm towel to wipe her face. “In ten minutes, we’ll need to put your consciousness back into the scene. Do you need more time to prepare?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head. “I’m ready anytime.”
 

 
In stark contrast to Tong Zhao's full confidence, the director, assistant director, and the supervisor who ultimately supported the decision were all, without exception, extremely nervous, sweating with anxiety, worried that the desired effect wouldn’t be achieved. The assistant director comforted them, saying, “Even if it doesn't work out, the result will just be more ordinary, but not bad. Did you think the first half of the film was bad?”
 

 
“Of course it wasn’t bad.”
 

 
Shuyi portrayed a character who possessed extraordinary martial arts skills but was calm, reserved, and had a very modern mindset.
 

 
She was easier to like than the pre-set character of Xie Guiya, and her performance was very appealing.
 

 
“But in the last third of the story…” Director Shi’s gaze shifted to the frozen surveillance footage, which was now starting a sixty-second countdown. When it hit zero, the second phase of the consciousness deployment would be complete. “I want to see a protagonist with contrast, someone whose emotions are more outwardly expressive and vivid… Seriously, can you imagine Tong Zhao’s Xie Guiya pinning someone down and beating them up? She’s the type who would call the police after subduing a criminal. It’s hard to picture her executing extrajudicial punishment.”
 

 
The assistant director nodded in agreement and teased, “I can imagine her subduing the criminal and extracting all of his past secrets and little secrets out of him.”
 

 
...
 

 
The world inside the scene resumed its motion.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng waited for a while, but when there was still no reaction from the protagonist, he shook his head in utter disappointment. “You’ve got backup waiting, don’t you?”
 

 
Previously, Shuyi had always managed to stay one step ahead and had backup ready.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng guessed that this time would be no different.
 

 
As the still image came to life again, every crew member backstage became tense, fearing that Tong Zhao, like before, would be just as clever this time, always one step ahead and avoiding the fight. In fact, if it had been any other actor, there wouldn't be such an issue because, as long as the template master adjusted the adrenaline levels, the actor would act like a firecracker ready to go off, performing in ways that were more extreme and suited for the climax of the story...
 

 
But this trick didn’t work on Tong Zhao!
 

 
They were starting to suspect that Tong Zhao had undergone some special training, allowing her to ignore any physical discomfort and always make the optimal choice, no matter the situation.
 

 
This was unbelievable.
 

 
“Backup?”
 

 
In the scene, Tong Zhao, after helping the injured Cheng Siwen to the wall, slowly repeated the words “backup” in a soft voice.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng threw her a phone from a distance, reminding her, “You can still call the police.”
 

 
The supervisor was stunned. “What the hell? When did he get a phone?”
 

 
In the film, Fu Xuancheng, who had suffered from domestic violence and was so poor he couldn’t even afford basic necessities, had never really been in contact with electronics. He was a complete tech illiterate. Moreover, at this moment, handing a phone to Tong Zhao…
 

 
The assistant director slapped his forehead, suddenly remembering that Jiang Dang’s thought process was also a bit extraordinary.
 

 
“Call the police?”
 

 
At this moment, the Tong Zhao in the scene repeated his words again.
 

 
She caught the phone Fu Xuancheng had thrown at her.
 

 
Is she really going to call the police?
 

 
Everyone couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. The supervisor turned his head irritably, unable to tolerate Tong Zhao’s overly reserved subconscious behavior. Being refined is great, but here, they needed her to explode with emotion. Why was she holding back?
 

 
However, the next development made everyone’s eyes widen in shock.
 

 
They saw Tong Zhao stand up, let go, and the phone fell to the ground.
 

 
Then, with one swift step, she stomped on the phone, crushing it with a loud, forceful sound. The glass screen slammed against the uneven floor and shattered under the pressure, glass fragments scattering all over the place.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked the glass shards aside.
 

 
The crew held their breath, and Fu Xuancheng stared at her intently.
 

 
Screenwriter: “Wait, isn’t that her boyfriend’s phone?”
 

 
Template artist: “Enough, you’ve already broken the atmosphere.”
 

 
Fu Xuancheng stared at her for a moment, then asked:
 

 
“You clearly have excellent martial arts skills, yet you always avoid confrontation. Why?”
 

 
The crew members realized with a sinking feeling that, based on Tong Zhao’s subconscious behavior earlier, this was a sign that she was about to have a conversation!
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head and looked up.
 

 
The moonlight fell into her eyes, shattering into pieces.
 

 
Her delicate face showed no smile, and her facial features were tense and sharp, forming cold, ruthless lines.
 

 
No words were necessary— even through the cold screen, every viewer could feel her anger.
 

 
The template artist silently gasped in shock, quickly checking the backstage data to see if he had administered too much hormone to her. How was the effect so strong? But no, the data clearly showed that the dosage was appropriate, just enough to make an average worker—who would normally endure a 996 work schedule—stand up to his boss and argue reasonably.
 

 
But it shouldn’t have made her look like she was ready to kill someone, right?
 

 
In the next moment, the Tong Zhao on the surveillance footage lunged forward!
# Chapter91
Is this really the same person?
 

 
At this moment, both the crew and the villain were questioning their very souls.
 

 
The final battle had a pre-set action template, designed so that "once the mind makes a move, the brain and body already have a complete set of actions ready." It's like playing a video game where, after thousands of rounds, certain combos like "a1, a3, a3" become instinctive—no thinking required, just ensuring a spectacular performance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Fu Xuancheng flying!
 

 
The director, still somewhat composed, said, "It's okay, we were always going to adjust many of the camera angles in post-production. This moment is quite impactful."
 

 
The action designer had also prepared many templates to guide him.
 

 
In short, the movie crew had gone to great lengths to ensure that an actor who had never studied martial arts could still pull off a thrilling action scene. It was almost like playing a rhythm game, but the tricky part was that Tong Zhao didn't play by the usual rules... her subconscious mind had actual skills! The fight scenes she delivered were truly hard-hitting and incredibly impressive!
 

 
But directing her—well, that was both a painful and thrilling challenge.
 

 
So, what did the action designer do?
 

 
Of course, he didn’t give up!
 

 
"Alright, Fu Xuancheng being kicked away was within my calculations," said the action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ as his fingers flew over the control panel, so fast that his fingers blurred. "I anticipated that Tong Zhao's subconscious wouldn't follow the plan, so I prepared several backup options just waiting for her to make her move!"
 

 
Everyone else looked at him with admiration.
 

 
Now ‘that’ is professionalism.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, who had been kicked away, took less than a second to recover and switch to a defensive stance, preparing to strike. However, Tong Zhao was even faster. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, she appeared right in front of him. Fu Xuancheng's heart raced—there was no time to dodge!
 

 
Outside the scene, the action designer smirked coldly. "Don’t underestimate my reaction speed. I played professional e-sports for a year!"
 

 
The action coding input in the backstage system would precede the brain's instructions—this is what’s known as a "subconscious action." This type of movement doesn’t appear often in regular dramatic scenes, as actors might start doubting their mental state if it happens too frequently, potentially hindering the performance. However, in high-frequency action scenes, there's no such worry. Fu Xuancheng would only think that his experience made him so skilled that his body instinctively reacted before his mind could process it.
 

 
With the action designer’s help, Fu Xuancheng narrowly sidestepped, avoiding a fatal strike. Only his shoulder was hit.
 

 
It was a wooden sword, but the dull pain it caused was no less intense than that of a metal blade.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s entire body tensed as he lowered his stance, locking eyes with her.
 

 
Unexpectedly, she didn’t go for a quick attack. Instead, she stood still, glancing up at Fu Xuancheng, her hand still gripping the wooden sword.

Within the story, Duan Ge, upon regaining consciousness, received the full character memory.
 

 
Duan Ge had never been a mindless killer. On the contrary, leading her companions to survive in the post-apocalyptic world required constant avoidance of conflict, only striking decisively and precisely when absolutely necessary. Killing one person should be equivalent to killing ten—she wasn’t a sadist. However, the personality shaped by extreme conditions didn’t quite fit with the peaceful times.
 

 
Let me give an example.
 

 
In peaceful times, an ordinary person, when enraged to the point of explosion, would slap someone across the face.
 

 
In extreme conditions, Duan Ge, when enraged to the point of explosion, would want to knock someone’s head off and kick it like a soccer ball.
 

 
Right now, Duan Ge really wanted to twist off the head of the person who had hurt her boyfriend and kick it around.
 

 
“You’ve asked for a fight again and again.”
 

 
“To be honest, I don’t like martial arts at all, and I despise violence. I can’t understand creatures like you who take pleasure in combat.”
 

 
“Alright then…”
 

 
She stretched her arms and then, with her palm facing up, made a beckoning gesture at him.
 

 
“I’ll let you experience the essence of traditional martial arts—until you’re dead.”
 

 
As she spoke, Duan Ge smiled.
 

 
The curve at the corner of her eyes was both charming and violent.
 

 
---
 

 
Whenever action scenes appeared, it was the time for the action designer to shine.
 

 
Everyone else could only remain quiet and try not to disturb his work.
 

 
“Hmph, just you, Tong Zhao, I’ll see how you fight me!”
 

 
“Ah, hasn’t Jiang Dang’s physical condition been enhanced? Why is he still so weak?”
 

 
“Template designer, template designer, can you adjust the backstage data again? Oh, and how about activating a blood lock cheat for him!”
 

 
The entire backstage was filled with the increasingly insane and unreasonable demands from the action designer.
 

 
The template designer weakly raised his hand. “Uh, it’s already set to the maximum. I really can’t activate any more cheats…”
 

 
The action designer couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Even with his help, Fu Xuancheng still couldn’t defeat Tong Zhao!
 

 
How could there be a female star with such superior combat skills?
 

 
Does this girl really just run errands for her schedule instead of competing in mixed martial arts?
 

 
A deep sense of defeat enveloped him.
 

 
In front of him stood a mountain called Tong Zhao, one that he could only look up to, but could never overcome.
 

 
---
 

 
Because the movie’s main character, while searching for information on the villain, had come across many martial arts secrets, greatly enhancing her strength, she had also begun to accept this “family tradition.” She had studied longer than Fu Xuancheng, who started later, but had always been unwilling to admit that she was so powerful.
 

 
The first two-thirds of the story were about “this protagonist being incredibly strong yet overly cautious.”
 

 
And the climax, when it finally erupted, was especially satisfying.
 

 
And the villain? The villain was the one who made the audience feel good.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was beaten half to death, and Duan Ge was injured a bit.
 

 
The action designer, who initially wanted to manipulate the villain to defeat the protagonist, then aimed for a draw, and in the end, compromised to the humble goal of "don't ruin that handsome face..."
 

 
Duan Ge handed Fu Xuancheng over to the police, and before leaving, he grabbed her hand. "Didn’t we agree to fight until one of us dies?"
 

 
"The times have changed, big bad wolf."
 

 
Duan Ge tilted her head and gave him a heroic smile.
 

 
---
 

 
Later, because Fu Xuancheng didn’t actually kill anyone and was a minor (Duan Ge: "He’s that young???"), the authorities chose to let him off lightly. A relevant organization helped him return to school, saying he wanted to be the protagonist’s junior and wanted to pursue her.
 

 
Duan Ge said: "With your IQ, that’s unlikely, but you can come to my martial arts school to become my disciple."
 

 
After much consideration, the protagonist reconciled with her father and decided to take over the martial arts school.
 

 
One person couldn’t handle it alone, so Jianghu informant Gu Xiaopan (who had previously been at home) found another place to squat—she came to her martial arts school. Together, they began researching whether traditional martial arts could be adapted into a more manageable version—one that was less grueling but still strong for the body.
 

 
In the torrent of the times, what gets washed away isn’t necessarily the weak or unworthy, but more likely what doesn’t fit the new era’s standards. It’s still good. The protagonist resisted martial arts because what her father taught her was in stark contrast to what she was taught in school. As a young child, she was like a diode, and she firmly believed that it should be discarded.
 

 
After a series of dangerous yet somewhat amusing events, the protagonist came to terms with two things in her heart.
 

 
The story ended on a satisfying note.
 

 
The screenwriter was at a loss for words: "Although... but... however..."
 

 
What should he say?
 

 
The ending was fitting.
 

 
But it seemed like the process had nothing to do with what he originally wrote.
 

 
A huge sense of disappointment enveloped him, but thinking about the payment that had already been deposited into his account made it feel a bit better. After all, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t a film that focused on the screenwriter; everything was based on whether Director Shi Dingjun was satisfied, and it seemed like he couldn’t wait to start editing the final cut.
 

 
Unlike traditional films, the most tedious part of instinct films was the pre-production and post-editing. The actual filming with the actors was much quicker.
 

 
Everyone was celebrating the successful conclusion.
 

 
Indeed, the joys and sorrows of people do not really connect!
 

 
As the screenwriter reflected in his melancholy, his gaze met that of the action designer, who was sitting dejectedly. In that brief moment when their eyes locked, it felt like two lonely whales tuning into the same wavelength. They shared a common formidable opponent. Even though the work had come to a satisfying conclusion, they couldn’t feel happiness—only overwhelming defeat. Their gazes seemed to offer each other solace, almost sparking something…
 

 
But it really felt way too ‘gay’.
 

 
The two, who were both very rigid in terms of their inclinations, simultaneously turned away with expressionless faces.
 

 
How should one describe this feeling?
 

 
It’s like the screenwriter playing mid-lane, and Tong Zhao playing jungle. The jungle keeps taking all the screen time from the mid-lane, and in the end, Tong Zhao economically dominates, carrying the whole game and easily securing the star of the match. Meanwhile, the screenwriter just coasts along, winning without contributing much, and ends up being slaughtered by the enemy team…
 

 
Did they win the game?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
Are the teammates happy?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
But him? 0/22/0, face down in defeat, with no game experience.
 

 
Not only unhappy, but a bit wronged as well.
 

 
"If it weren't for Tong Zhao being so tired, I’d really want to go over the replay with her."
 

 
"Yeah, I didn’t expect her subconscious to have such explosive power."
 

 
The crew excitedly discussed the raw footage.
 

 
Movies are ultimately art and need to be exaggerated, but sometimes instinctive films can be too realistic and fail to achieve those exaggerated twists. Tong Zhao’s subconscious, though, pulled it off! It was like the saying, "You look five pounds heavier on camera." If she looks so slim on screen, how thin must she be in real life? This led to a discussion about Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
The stagehand said, “But I think Xiao Zhao is really friendly.”
 

 
“Yeah, she’s just an ordinary person. Except for being a bit quiet, she doesn’t put on airs.”
 

 
“I’m a fan of hers…”
 

 
The screenwriter felt that his friendship with the template designer had reached its end.
 

 
No, there was still one person—this person’s feelings should be just like his!
 

 
The screenwriter thought of Jiang Dang, who had been beaten up badly.
 

 
Well, once Jiang Dang regains his memories from the film, maybe he should chat with him for a bit.
 

 
---
 

 
Since she had to rush off for other engagements, Tong Zhao didn’t stay long in Qin City after waking up from the cabin. She took the earliest flight back to the company, and as soon as she landed, she was taken to the studio to shoot for a magazine cover. Jiang Dang, on the other hand, had three days off and spent a whole night resting at the Qin City Film Studio. At the celebration banquet, he finally met the screenwriter, who seemed eager to talk.
 

 
The screenwriter had deliberately arranged to sit next to him and said, "Sigh, it seems like you’re the only one who understands how I feel!"
 

 
Jiang Dang nodded, "Yes, we're both eating steamed bass."
 

 
---
 

 
The screenwriter was exasperated, "I mean ‘feelings’."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked back at him honestly, "Is there something different about your bass?"
 

 
The table just happened to have a big dish of steamed bass, and they coincidentally both took a bite. Wasn’t it the "same feeling"? The screenwriter remembered the rumors about Jiang Dang’s unusual thought process, but in the entertainment industry, he always only believed half of the rumors: "Maybe I wasn’t clear earlier. I mean the feeling of you being beaten half to death by Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jiang Dang’s expression subtly changed.
 

 
Seeing this, the screenwriter immediately got excited.
 

 
"Right? I hit a nerve, didn’t I?"
 

 
"Let’s hug and cry together, licking each other’s wounds!"
 

 
"Has she hit you before?" Jiang Dang asked, his gaze darkening slightly, a bit inexplicably displeased.
 

 
The screenwriter was taken aback. "No, not really."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Jiang Dang leisurely picked up a piece of tender bass, dipped it in white sugar, and ate it. His devilishly handsome side profile and elegant eating style couldn’t suppress the screenwriter's sense of nausea at seeing this scene… Maybe the problem with this guy wasn’t his thought process, but his taste buds.
 

 
The screenwriter decided to get to the point. "Doesn't it hurt, getting beaten like that by her?"
 

 
After chewing slowly and savoring, Jiang Dang turned his gaze back to him.
 

 
Jiang Dang had eyes that were as steady as a rock in a world of vanity, with a heart that seemed to hold deep thoughts and layers of meaning, not a complaint like "I can't believe bass goes with sugar—this is so gross, I got duped again."
 

 
The screenwriter felt his heart skip a beat under his gaze.
 

 
No wonder he was called the "godly face" of the music industry... Unlike when he looked at the action designer, this time the screenwriter felt that sexual orientation didn’t need to be so rigid. If the person in question was Jiang Dang, he could be flexible!
 

 
"It doesn’t hurt," Jiang Dang said with a slight curve of his lips, his eyes flashing with a mad excitement. "I actually like it. I want her to hit me again. You said our feelings are the same... Do you want to have a spar with her too? If you really want it, I can help you get in touch with her manager, but whether she agrees is up to her."
 

 
---
 

 
"No thanks."
 

 
"I don’t mean to monopolize her, you know."
 

 
Seeing the change in the screenwriter’s expression, Jiang Dang thought maybe his face was too intimidating. He tried to soften his tone.
 

 
"Mm, mm, really no need, thank you, thank you."
 

 
---
 

 
The screenwriter turned to the modeling supervisor and asked, "Can we switch seats?"
# Chapter92
While others were celebrating, Tong Zhao was still hard at work.
 

 
After two non-stop days, her assistant was so exhausted that every step felt like walking on clouds, stumbling along in a daze. It was no surprise—Tong Zhao, a superstar like her, setting aside an entire month to focus on rigorous training was incredibly rare. It showed a deep love for her craft and earned her praise within the film industry, as well as approval from critics.
 

 
After all, in both traditional and instinctive cinema, audiences ultimately want to see actors put themselves through the wringer in the name of "artistic dedication."
 

 
Many times, Tong Zhao suggested her assistant go home and get some rest.
 

 
The assistant firmly refused, saying, "If Sister Zhao isn't resting, how can I?"
 

 
"I could go a whole week without sleep."
 

 
Tong Zhao, having only slept four hours in the past two days, shot her a look. Her small, sharp face looked as energetic as if she'd had a full eight hours of sleep, making the assistant almost believe that people might not need sleep after all. "Sister Zhao, stop joking. Let’s get through this last set of shots, and then we can go home and rest."
 

 
"Alright," Tong Zhao replied, closing her eyes again.
 

 
This shoot had a rugged, cold theme, requiring her to wear military fatigues and give the camera a fierce expression. For her, it was effortless—no acting required, just posing naturally. Since she started training in spiritual cultivation, she barely needed sleep, but the less she slept, the worse her mood got...
 

 
Before shooting, Tong Zhao sat fully equipped in a corner, completely uninterested in interacting with anyone. Sunglasses and mask on, she looked like a mysterious character.
 

 
Over time, with the success of one hit film after another, Tong Zhao’s status in the industry had quietly risen.
 

 
She now had every right to assert herself.
 

 
Of course, in the entertainment world, even her modest setup wasn’t anything remarkable. Though she had graciously treated the entire crew to milk tea upon arriving at the studio, the gesture didn't really sway opinions much. For her, it wasn’t worth the energy to manage her image too meticulously.
 

 
In fact, at times, letting people assume she had a bit of a temper wasn’t such a bad thing.
 

 
Now, the staff around her recognized her growing influence and quietly adjusted, moving more carefully, keeping conversations low, not wanting to disrupt her. This unspoken courtesy allowed Tong Zhao to relax and rest for a moment.
 

 
After finishing the photoshoot, Tong Zhao removed her makeup and, too tired to trek back to her faraway apartment, decided to check into a bay-view suite at a nearby Hilton. She went straight to sleep, planning to figure out her next move when she woke up.
 

 
After she woke up, her agent called, asking where she was.
 

 
When Tong Zhao answered, Sister Chu chuckled, "Good choice of room—I was just about to discuss a little matter with you."
 

 
It turned out to be about housing.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's rapid rise in the industry, her current single apartment—which was perfectly fine for a newcomer—was no longer suitable. For both her image and security, a new home was in order. "I’d wanted to bring this up for a while, but things kept getting delayed."
 

 
As status rises, so must every aspect of one’s lifestyle—housing, clothing, transportation.
 

 
"No problem."
 

 
After a short understanding reply, Tong Zhao got up from bed. "Arrange someone to take me to check out some homes. I’d rather not pick out an entire neighborhood myself."
 

 
Sister Chu laughed, "Of course, I'll make sure you’re set up with something excellent."
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished washing up and applying a bit of makeup for going out, the driver and entourage were already waiting downstairs.
 

 
The property Sister Chu selected for her was a single-unit-per-floor high-rise in a prime location with first-class security and privacy. Naturally, the price and maintenance fees were steep, but at this point, they were necessities for Tong Zhao, who was never one to shortchange herself.
 

 
The new property was a massive flat with eight rooms and four living areas.
 

 
The sales agent, sharp-eyed and professional, emphasized the privacy features of Yu Long Xuan and the in-house cleaning team, which could be used for an additional fee. This way, there was no need to risk hiring unreliable outside services. He added with a smile, “And even if someone hires an external cleaning service, it’d be difficult for them to get in here without being escorted by the owner or tenant.”
 

 
Tong Zhao believed him.
 

 
Just getting in herself had felt like passing through multiple security gates.
 

 
After viewing the property, she was thoroughly satisfied and didn’t feel the need to shop around further—she went straight ahead and paid the down payment.
 

 
In fact, she could afford to pay the full price by cashing out some of her shares and investments. But rather than pay all at once, she preferred to let that few million yuan work for her, earning returns instead of saving a bit of interest.
 

 
"Whew..."
 

 
Now all that was left was arranging for the moving company.
 

 
Once the paperwork was done, she could move in as soon as the master bedroom was ready; it would definitely be more comfortable than a hotel.
 

 
Relieved, Tong Zhao shared the news with her friends in a group chat: "I’m officially someone with a mortgage now!"
 

 
Friend A: "Sounds so novel—I want to try it too."
 

 
Friend B: "Can’t wait to visit your new place, Zhao!"
 

 
Friend C: "Where’d you buy it?"
 

 
After chatting and laughing with them for a while, she messaged Wei Zekai privately, who had been trying to play dead: "Stop pretending. What's your connection to Yu Long Xuan?"
 

 
Good properties usually sold out before construction was even complete.
 

 
The unit Tong Zhao bought had never been lived in—it was brand new.
 

 
Although Yu Long Xuan was absurdly expensive, it was considered “prime real estate,” targeted toward the city’s wealthy residents. And the city was not short of wealthy people. Although Sister Chu had plenty of influence in the entertainment industry, this deal went beyond her reach. So Tong Zhao suspected Wei Zekai had something to do with it. After the incident with ‘Neptune Hunt’ and the previous rumors, her manager still had his contact info.
 

 
Wei Zekai confessed honestly: "My uncle is in real estate, and I asked Sister Chu if you needed to move. When Yu Long Xuan was finished, we set aside a batch of the best units, which weren’t publicly available. Don’t be mad."
 

 
Her manager probably just thought she’d recommended a decent property.
 

 
Little did she know it’d rack up such a big favor.
 

 
"I’m not mad; I should’ve asked you, honestly. You know this stuff better." Tong Zhao wasn’t one to fuss over debts with someone who genuinely cared for her. Besides, she and her childhood friend had built up so many mutual favors over the years that there was no point in keeping score.
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Know it better, my ass! I don’t know real estate."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "So, what do you know?"
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Entrepreneurship!"
 

 
…
 

 
Sometimes, Tong Zhao found it hard to tell if he was joking or dead serious.
 

 
In any case, the moving company quickly transported her belongings from the old apartment to her new home. With the numerous layers of paperwork and approvals involved in buying a luxury home, word about her purchase inevitably leaked to the media. Considering her current film fees and endorsement income, it was clear that purchasing a luxury property like Yu Long Xuan was a bit of a stretch for her budget.
 

 
Experts among the public didn’t take long to calculate her approximate income and compare it to the price of the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan.
 

 
The gap was at least several million yuan.
 

 
On Weibo and various forums, netizens were buzzing with surprise at her extravagant spending.
 

 
- “My whole family is shocked by her wealth—how can she have so much money?”
 

 
- “The genre of ‘immersive cinema’ is a huge market—either you profit big or lose big. Tong Zhao’s films have all been hits, and her pay rate must be sky-high by now. Her fan base alone wouldn’t cover this; it’s really her good relationship with audiences and her knack for picking the right projects.”
 

 
- “Sure, the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan is expensive, but there’s no rule saying she had to pay it all at once! If it’s just the down payment, her income could definitely cover it.”
 

 
Up to this point, the discussion remained positive.
 

 
But it’s the internet—how long can that positivity really last?
 

 
Faced with an apparently perfect celebrity, some netizens started saying, “Really? I don’t believe it,” digging deep for anything suspicious. They uncovered a leak from the bank confirming that Tong Zhao had taken a mortgage rather than paying in full.
 

 
Netizens began wondering why she’d need such a large place.
 

 
-“Maybe she’s just used to living in luxury. When she left her family, she moved from a mansion to a low-cost apartment.”
 

 
- “And now, she’s worked her way back up to an even better mansion! So inspiring, Zhao Zhao! [crying emoji]”
 

 
- “I wish her lousy dad could see this.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming did see it.
 

 
It was hard to miss—even though he only read print newspapers, he couldn’t escape news about his eldest daughter’s latest movie. There was even a giant billboard across from his company featuring her face, all made up and strikingly beautiful, seeming to look down on his business. Every time he saw it, it irritated him to the point where just the sight of Xu Zhu bothered him.
 

 
How could two children from the same family turn out so different?
 

 
Tong Zhenming couldn’t figure it out.
 

 
When he couldn’t make sense of it, he’d go home and take his frustrations out on Xu Zhu, sometimes even physically, though he had held back recently, as her wedding was coming up. She was marrying into the He family; their young master had few options after experiencing a strange wave of setbacks in business. Faced with her father’s plan to marry her off as the second wife of a wealthy older businessman, Xu Zhu settled on the He family as a last resort.
 

 
To support the marriage alliance, Tong Zhenming bought her an apartment, fully paid as part of her dowry.
 

 
Since paparazzi couldn’t dig up any new stories on Tong Zhao, they turned their focus to the father-daughter duo. Even a single unpleasant comment from them would make a juicy headline.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was moving around like an urban hermit, as though in hiding. She had already completed her publicity tour and magazine covers, leaving her largely untraceable while public interest in her was at a fever pitch.
 

 
…
 

 
On Xu Zhu’s wedding dress shopping day, she barely made it out of the store when three people jumped out from the roadside.
 

 
“Xu Zhu, I’m a reporter from Papaya Media. I have a few questions for you.”
 

 
Xu Zhu had never experienced anything like this and clung to her father’s arm in fright.
 

 
When she had been an idol, she hadn’t been particularly famous; the few interviews she had were orchestrated by the company to generate hype.
 

 
“What are you doing!” Tong Zhenming snapped, his eyes flashing with anger.
 

 
Normally, Tong Zhenming wouldn’t accompany Xu Zhu on outings. But today, he planned to take her for wedding dress shopping and then join the He family for a dinner between the two families, so he decided to come along. Little did he know this would land him in hot water.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhenming there too, the three paparazzi reporters became even more excited, their eyes lighting up as if they’d struck gold.
 

 
“What are your thoughts on Tong Zhao buying a high-end A1 unit at Yu Long Xuan after publicly severing your father-daughter relationship?” one reporter fired off rapidly. “Are you considering helping her out financially?”
 

 
The public announcement of his estrangement from his eldest daughter had been one of the most humiliating moments of Tong Zhenming’s life. His expression changed instantly. “Are you crazy? What she does has nothing to do with me. I don’t acknowledge her as my daughter! Why should I support her?”
 

 
People who aren’t used to dealing with the media often get caught off guard. Whether they deny or react with shock, it just creates more material for journalists to exploit.
 

 
Sensing a newsworthy moment, one reporter gave a sly smile and added fuel to the fire. “That’s quite a statement. By the way, is it true that Miss Xu Zhu is getting married soon?” he asked, noticing they had just stepped out of a lavish bridal boutique. “Just curious—are you being fair in providing dowries?”
 

 
Another reporter chimed in, “Tong Zhao is paying off her house through a mortgage.”
 

 
Their questions were loaded with insinuations and structured to provoke, giving Tong Zhenming little room to answer gracefully. In frustration, he raised his voice, shouting, “Impossible! Not a single cent will go to her. I only have one daughter, Zhu Zhu, and I’ve paid for her home in full.”
 

 
Xu Zhu, who had been unwillingly thrust into the spotlight, forced herself to smile and nod for the reporters. “My father treats me very well, but support also brings responsibility. I’ll make sure to take care of him, as well as for my sister’s share,” she added sweetly.
 

 
She had no intention of being photographed looking unpleasant.
 

 
Perfect! That was exactly what the reporters wanted.
 

 
The journalists exchanged glances, and just then, the driver, who had been circling the mall for ages to find parking, finally arrived. The reporters rushed into the car as if they’d been rescued, and sped off, leaving the Tong family trio in relative peace, all of them breathing a sigh of relief.
 

 
Tong Zhenming’s round face was flushed red with anger as he continued ranting about his eldest daughter. “Always stirring up trouble! She’s the one who announced our estrangement, yet I’m the one facing all the hassles? Ridiculous! Buying a place at Yu Long Xuan—who does she think she is? And if she can’t make her mortgage payments and comes begging me, I won’t lift a finger!”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt somewhat appeased.
 

 
She wanted a place at Yu Long Xuan herself. The neighbors there were all wealthy, the ocean view was stunning, but her father wouldn’t buy one for her, and her husband’s family…well, perhaps if she gave them a son and their business continued to do well, they might buy one for her husband. But it certainly wouldn’t be in her name.
 

 
At least, her own pre-wedding home had been paid for in full.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually dared to take out a mortgage?
 

 
"Nothing blooms for a hundred days. In the entertainment industry, a star who rises to fame at the beginning of the year might already be fading by the end of it."
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched the hem of her dress, trying not to think about the possibility that the powerful Wei family’s eldest son might support ‘that’ woman financially…
 

 
If only she had the choice, she’d want to marry into the Wei family too.

"The Ultimate Triumph of the Mistress! Tong Zhenming Prepares a Full Dowry for His Youngest Daughter, Declares He Won't Give a Dime to Tong Zhao"
 

 
Bala Media, with a bit of a Hong Kong tabloid vibe, used sensationalist headlines designed to attract clicks. Known for ignoring PR maneuvers and focusing solely on what draws viewers' attention, this media outlet prioritizes shock value over integrity or morals. Their report cast Tong Zhenming and his younger daughter, born of his mistress, back into the spotlight, where netizens once again condemned them. By the time people suggested that Tong Zhenming should’ve kept quiet, it was already too late.
 

 
With a father like him, there were hardly any accusations left that painted Tong Zhao as ungrateful or extreme.
 

 
In the public eye, Tong Zhao—having to take out a loan to afford her first property without any help from her family—came across as someone to be pitied, almost tragic.
 

 
But this also posed an image problem for her.
 

 
After all, she was carving out a multi-talented career, aiming to be a figure of admiration for her fans.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao herself...
 

 
“I don’t need fans to worship me as some kind of deity, but I also don’t want anyone thinking I’m a pitiable figure,” she said coolly in a company meeting, seated at the head of the table, her sunglasses still on. Only the lower half of her face was visible—perfectly defined and framed by vivid red lips, which parted to deliver her next words calmly.
 

 
“This is the perfect opportunity to reveal that I have other businesses.”
 

 
While she would have preferred for her “past” to stay quiet, if they kept stirring things up, then she'd take advantage of the situation. No news story would bring her down, and no mud-slinging would stick to her name for more than a day.
# Chapter93
What Does It Mean to Live Well?
 

 
Throughout history, being adored by men has often been the benchmark of a woman’s success. Even a wealthy woman without a happy marriage or children isn’t seen as fully fulfilled; her "crown" seems less radiant. People may talk about her with regret, and the tabloids may mock her.
 

 
While this is the kind of lowbrow behavior we often see from certain tabloids, it reflects a deeply ingrained attitude. Many people, influenced by traditional views on fatherly or marital support, still equate a woman's security with having either a supportive father or a devoted husband. If she lacks one, people hope she at least has the other.
 

 
As a result, many of Tong Zhao's casual fans are eager to see her in a dream-like relationship, perhaps even a lavish wedding to a wealthy partner. It would be, to them, the perfect rebuttal to her neglectful father.
 

 
“Come on,” one fan wrote, “those who pity Tong Zhao clearly don’t know who her admirers are! Look at Wei Zekai’s feelings for her on that variety show. Marrying into wealth is just a matter of time.”
 

 
“Her dad? Please, everyone knows he doesn’t even deserve to shine Wei’s shoes,” another commenter added. “Honestly, I think Wei’s family has been making things difficult for the Tong family’s business lately.”
 

 
Fans spoke confidently, sometimes acting as if they knew more about her life than she did.
 

 
Some of them even used this moment to promote fan fiction, shipping Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a popular fictional pairing. From romantic stories like ‘[WeiZhao] The Joy of Our Youthful Meeting’ to comedy pieces like ‘[WeiZhao] The Playboy Meets the dog’, these stories became fan favorites, bringing people into the fandom. And surprisingly, the couple’s “evidence” wasn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
For instance, fans had uncovered Tong Zhao’s main ‘Honor of Kings’ account. Though she wasn’t a VIP player, her account had all the skins available, meaning someone had been gifting them to her. And because her intimacy level was visible to other players, it wasn’t hard for fans to connect her with Wei Zekai, whose account appeared as her top “friend,” showering her with gifts.
 

 
The two hadn’t officially announced anything, and their in-game relationship was just a blue “buddy” connection. Plus, Wei Zekai had a high intimacy score with many friends, indicating that he simply enjoyed sending gifts to everyone in his circle.
 

 
Netizens quickly uncovered that Wei’s account constantly had tens of thousands of in-game currency, which he spent generously on each new skin release, even gifting friends who didn’t actively play. Tong Zhao once commented, “It’s normal for him. Back in elementary school, he’d always buy tons of Little Raccoon noodles and hand out the collectible cards to classmates.”
 

 
It was just a sign of his generosity, not necessarily any exclusive affection.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao even had a chance to clarify, however, the group of second-generation rich friends from Wei Zekai’s circle in ZeShan Capital had already gotten a bit anxious over the gossip.
 

 
All the friends popped up in unison, quickly distancing themselves and humorously encouraging Wei Zekai to "untie himself" from any love rumors.
 

 
The first two who spoke up on Weibo were relatively subtle:
 

 
@SecondGen_A:
 
“The only single scent around here is coming from Wei Zekai. Don’t drag him into the mess of romance.”
 

 
@SecondGen_B:
 
“Pure, innocent brotherhood—can’t say it’ll stay that way, though! /dog face”
 

 
Then, things quickly took a humorous turn:
 

 
@SecondGen_C:
 
“With my brother Zekai’s emotional intelligence, getting married at 30 would still be ‘early dating’ for him!”
 

 
…
 

 
@SecondGen_E:
 
“Pick me instead! Aren’t I and Zhao Zhao legit? [Photo.JPG]”
 

 
This was a soft, sweet girl from the south with family wealth, just a notch below Wei Zekai’s in ZeShan Ventures. Her close photo with Tong Zhao set off a playful competition, with everyone, half-serious, half-joking, claiming Tong Zhao as “the best sister ever.”
 

 
Seeing the fuss, Wei Zekai couldn’t stay silent. With a strong sense of caution, he checked with Tong Zhao first to avoid saying anything that might trouble her. His thoughtfulness impressed her—he’d clearly grown a lot since his early days running ZeShan Ventures, where his emotional
 
intelligence was low, and he acted impulsively with little regard for others.
 

 
In their past life, Wei Zekai’s bluntness and Tong Zhao’s stubbornness had led to a falling-out so severe that they became estranged.
 

 
But this time, Tong Zhao smiled warmly and replied, “Hold on. You’re my trump card.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was both shocked and flattered. “Am I that important?”
 

 
“Of course.”
 

 
With all the cards in her hand, Tong Zhao controlled the game.
 

 
---
 

 
In the entertainment news, Tong Zhao took center stage, covering half the headlines. In the financial news, ZeShan Ventures was the undisputed leader.
 

 
This venture capital firm, which gained attention after investing in ‘Little Lamb Gaming’, had seen incredible profits lately. Every company they backed had turned profitable, creating groundbreaking returns, especially over the past six months, with ZeShan Ventures appearing at the forefront of the highest-return projects.
 

 
Industry insiders were baffled—could this company predict the future?
 

 
But it wasn’t just about providing funds. According to CEOs of invested companies, ZeShan’s representatives offered crucial guidance, helping them assess risks and refine their projects. Their advice was like turning stone to gold. These investors weren’t just seen as angels; they were practically revered.
 

 
And with reverence came respect—and a hint of awe.
 

 
Imagine that—a powerhouse like ZeShan Ventures guiding numerous companies to profitable outcomes naturally has ways to deal with anyone who tries to step out of line. Realizing this, the smaller companies in ZeShan's network dared not act out; instead, they obediently looked to ZeShan as the market compass, heeding their guidance on everything.
 

 
After all, they hadn’t finished raking in the profits yet.
 

 
As ZeShan's investors took the lion’s share of the profits, these partner companies also benefitted significantly, savoring the leftovers. And apart from a few key suggestions, ZeShan didn’t micromanage their operations, creating a sense of comfortable, cooperative, win-win relationships.
 

 
Several financial publications sought interviews with ZeShan’s mastermind, but every request was declined. Finally, Wei Zekai stepped in as the public face. Raised with all the privileges, he wore his suit with a natural authority and a hint of a “king of the boardroom” air—no trace of the inexperience typical of his age group. It was clear that the money the Wei family had poured into his development wasn’t wasted; his broad perspective and steady nerves were unmistakable.
 

 
A closer look at the interview content revealed that Wei Zekai was not a mere figurehead. He demonstrated full knowledge of all ZeShan’s investment projects, familiar with every detail. Yet, despite his expertise, most people still couldn’t believe he was the one providing all the critical advice and insights. His strategies seemed too forward-thinking for one so young.
 

 
Of course, both Wei Zekai and everyone at ZeShan Ventures were unanimous in maintaining that they were only executors; the real strategist behind the scenes was someone else.
 

 
Many established companies, curious about this “mastermind,” privately contacted Wei Zekai in hopes of getting in touch with this expert. But they got nowhere—any attempts were met with vague replies that this person was “too busy.”
 

 
Rumors spread, with some speculating that Wei’s conglomerate was guiding him. As industry chatter grew, ZeShan Ventures scored another major success in its latest venture. In response, China’s most respected financial magazine, ‘WeatherVane’, reached out, offering a feature story on the main cover. They were eager to uncover more exclusive information, particularly about the true identity of ZeShan’s mysterious strategist. Even an online interview would suffice if the person preferred to remain anonymous.
 

 
In the business world, idols aren’t movie stars but financial guides, those with the foresight to steer markets to profit. Whoever can make big money is, temporarily, a deity.
 

 
Surprisingly, ZeShan Ventures accepted WeatherVane's invitation.
 

 
Industry peers were quick to make snide remarks, saying the elusive mastermind wasn’t “impossible” to interview; it just took the right magazine with enough clout.
 

 
Criticism aside, anticipation was high.
 

 
Every issue of ‘WeatherVane’ attracted suit-clad professionals in convenience stores and upscale coffee shops, grabbing a copy. Typically, trendy young people weren’t interested. But with this issue, a strange phenomenon occurred.
 

 
Regardless of age or gender, people stopped when they passed the issue of ‘WeatherVane’… then stared at it, puzzled.
 

 
The background of the cover is pure black, with a high-backed leather office chair at the center. Tong Zhao is seated in the chair, her hands relaxed on the armrests. She is wearing a white custom-tailored women's suit that perfectly outlines her graceful figure. Her slightly amber eyes, faintly visible beneath her light-colored pupils, reveal a confident smile at the corners of her lips, giving off an air of someone in full control.
 

 
Since rising to fame, Tong Zhao has been a regular in major fashion magazines.
 

 
She is capable of mastering various shooting styles, which is neither uncommon nor surprising.
 

 
But can someone explain why she is on the cover of ‘WV’???
 

 
The two lines of subheadings at the bottom of the magazine gave the public an answer:
 

 
“ZeShan Investments true leader — Tong Zhao”
 

 
“New Generation Investment Trendsetter”
 

 
…
 

 
Huh?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
The direct consequence of the confusion was that even people who were not interested in finance or economics casually bought a copy, leaving many white-collar workers who were waiting for the ‘ZeShan’ interview speechless — ‘WV’ had always sold well, but not to this extent. Many had planned to buy it during their lunch break, only to find it sold out!
 

 
The news of Tong Zhao appearing on the cover of ‘WV’ quickly spread across Weibo.
 

 
Many fans who had no idea about this magazine thought it was some obscure fashion publication that somehow managed to feature their idol, Tong Zhao. They felt it was necessary to boost sales to support the magazine. Tong Zhao’s fans didn’t engage in bulk buying or mass purchases, but with so many of them, even fans of her ex-boyfriend Han Zhi would purchase a copy to show their support.
 

 
‘WeatherVane’, a reputable and serious financial magazine, was completely sold out in both physical and online stores within a single day, thanks to the combined efforts of curious passersby, fans, white-collar workers, and stock market enthusiasts.
 

 
After the truth came out, WV's regular readership began complaining about the "fandom frenzy."
 

 
However, the “fandom girls” were innocent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fan club and the official channels didn’t promote bulk buying or collect money for sales. They were used to buying just one copy for personal use, and maybe another as a collectible. They hadn’t even gotten involved in the buying spree! Many of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t even get a copy!
 

 
As a result, a debate started under WV’s official Weibo account.
 

 
[Can we be reasonable? It’s clearly because the official side didn’t anticipate the sales, which led to the stock running out. We didn’t buy that many.]
 

 
[Is WV prohibiting new readers from buying? If so, could the official account make a statement, please?]
 

 
After some “friendly” exchanges, the original readers realized it was just a mix-up and started blaming the official account. Fortunately, WV’s official Weibo responded quickly, issuing an apology and announcing that they would immediately print more copies to meet the demand, while also welcoming new readers to learn more about financial knowledge.
 

 
Some bystanders felt sorry for WV, while others in the industry commented:
 

 
[Why feel sorry for WV? With this kind of sales, the editor-in-chief is probably laughing so much their mouth is going to tear.]
 

 
This statement is quite accurate.
 

 
Just bringing in the mysterious backer of ZeShan Investments was already a huge draw, but then it turns out that the person is Tong Zhao? It’s like hitting the jackpot—two yolks in one egg, a pie falling from the sky, and inside the pie is a gold ingot. They've made a huge profit.
 

 
However, the editor-in-chief still underestimated Tong Zhao’s ability to drive sales and her popularity.
 

 
Although the new magazine couldn’t meet everyone’s demand for copies right away, the content was quickly scanned and uploaded, allowing curious readers to get a sneak peek.
# Chapter94
This issue of WV featured a very special profile.
 

 
It started by listing a long string of investment projects in great detail.
 

 
Industry professionals with some research background, or investors with a keen sense of smell, were all surprised to find that these were all high-profit projects from this year, including some that were originally not well-regarded but later made a dramatic rise. Several stocks performed surprisingly well after receiving investment, even managing to overtake competitors after a sudden boost...
 

 
All of these were projects that ZeShan Venture Capital had participated in, ranked by the depth of their involvement.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, not a single one had lost money.
 

 
In less than a year, ZeShan Venture Capital had already accumulated a staggering profit return.
 

 
[For a young investment firm, this is almost an impossible feat. Anyone who works in investment knows that the basic process involves thorough selection, review, and project evaluation. Only after this is a project deemed to have potential for profit is investment made. Even with the most careful evaluations, no matter how reliable a project appears, it still has the possibility of significant losses.]
 

 
[An investment firm's profits typically come from the profitable projects that offset the losses from the unsuccessful ones. As long as the gains exceed the losses, an overall profit is achieved.]
 

 
[Today, we have invited the star investor behind this venture capital firm for an exclusive interview.]
 

 
[However, what the author didn’t expect was that their true identity would be...]
 

 
Behind the four lines of white text, there was an elegant backshot.
 

 
The tailored suit made her shoulders sharp and strong, while her long hair cascaded down her back—during the photo shoot, Tong Zhao had rejected the stylist’s suggestion to tie her hair into a neat bun or adopt a more professional hairstyle. Why should the media erase feminine traits when talking about successful women? Why should she present herself as a gender-neutral elite to be considered professional?
 

 
Tong Zhao never thought this way.
 

 
Of course, when her identity was that of an investor, Tong Zhao didn’t deliberately emphasize her feminine charm.
 

 
What she showed was her most authentic side, yet still keeping a sense of distance.
 

 
The woman in that backshot had an enviable body figure, but complementing that was the shining record described in those lines of text. WV had many middle-aged male readers, whose interests were more about profit than vanity. They completely overlooked her figure, instead being deeply attracted by her achievements in the investment world.
 

 
How did she do it?
 

 
Did Tong Zhao have an investment column in WV?
 

 
Please, master, enlighten us!
 

 
This was the voice of some readers.
 

 
“When I saw Miss Tong for the first time, I knew this interview would cause a huge stir.”
 

 
Upon hearing the journalist’s question, Tong Zhao smiled. “I’ve been thinking about when to reveal this identity,” she paused and then added, “Actually, I didn’t deliberately hide it. It’s just that my main job is too busy, and all the public-facing tasks were handled by Zekai and the others. They also wanted to protect me as much as possible... It’s a lovely misunderstanding. Plus, since it has nothing to do with my acting career, revealing it just hasn’t made it to the agenda.”
 

 
When the topic turned to ZeShan Venture Capital's members, a warm expression appeared on Tong Zhao’s otherwise distant face.
 

 
“Mr. Wei Zekai has said before that founding ZeShan Venture Capital was your idea—was that true?”
 

 
Tong Zhao openly admitted this and briefly described how ZeShan was established. It sounded almost unbelievable that this highly profitable investment firm had been set up in such an informal and almost playful manner. There was even a hint of making it up as they went along: “The high efficiency of ZeShan in generating funds is directly related to the fact that it’s a one-man show. In the beginning, I had absolute decision-making power, but now that Zekai has matured a lot, I’ve entrusted him with many of the detailed decisions.”
 

 
“What made you choose to enter two completely unrelated industries? Was there any particular opportunity? Many people speculate that it’s because you come from a business family.” The last question, which touched on a sensitive topic, had been cleared with Tong Zhao beforehand.
 

 
She indeed needed a chance to clarify.
 

 
Tong Zhao would rather toss money around casually than gild the lily.
 

 
“Both film and investment require a good eye, and fortunately, I have that.”
 

 
“As for the opportunity? It has nothing to do with my family background. My father always believed that his daughter couldn’t take over the family business. My interest in business came partly from passion, and partly because...” At this point, Tong Zhao's lips curved into a joyful smile, and she continued, “Most of my friends have had some experience with business failures, so I thought I’d give it a try myself.”
 

 
The reporter then asked several questions regarding Tong Zhao’s views on investment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not hold back, but instead used her own successful experiences to explain things in a straightforward yet deep way.
 

 
Even readers with no understanding of finance or economics would not see Tong Zhao as just a figurehead in her company after reading her eloquent responses. Although there was a hint of hindsight in her words, she had succeeded many times—surely it couldn’t all be luck! Wouldn’t listening to a successful person be more insightful than reading some theoretical column?
 

 
The journalist quickly recorded what Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Since WV was a finance magazine, there were many questions that new readers might be curious about, but which the journalist couldn’t ask. However, the journalist still hoped to gain a little gossip for the readers...
 

 
When asked about her installment purchase of the Long Xuan property, Tong Zhao smiled lightly:
 

 
“Buying in installments was simply because I didn’t want it to tie up too much of my capital.”
 

 
“And as for the contributions from ZeShan members? They all sent me a lot of furniture to celebrate my housewarming. When I get a chance, I’ll share some pictures of my new home on Weibo.”
 

 
The interview concluded with a brief introduction of the value of the property Tong Zhao had purchased.
 

 
The final photo was taken in Tong Zhao's study.
 

 
Wearing frameless glasses, she hid the sparkle in her almond-shaped eyes, giving off a temperament that was both restrained and intellectual.
 

 
After the public uproar had died down a bit, Xu Zhu had been subtly flaunting her blissful, pre-marriage life on her personal Weibo. She received all of Tong Zhenming’s love and seemed to live like a princess in a fairytale, about to marry into a "rich family." As for the struggles behind closed doors, netizens knew nothing about it. Even if she had to swallow her bitterness in silence, she would never let Tong Zhao know that she wasn’t living well.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who lived alone in a spacious penthouse, had graced the cover of a well-known finance magazine, appearing like an all-powerful queen.
 

 
……
 

 
This scanned version of the interview allowed many netizens to finally read the content they were curious about.
 

 
While most netizens didn’t find anything unusual, Tong Zhao’s fans became anxious and spontaneously organized campaigns to promote subscriptions to WeatherVane's official digital version, which was reasonably priced. Of course, there were still those who had no qualms about reading pirated versions, but many fans, after being reminded, went ahead and purchased the high-definition digital versions, which resulted in a significant increase in the magazine’s online sales.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were very copyright-conscious.
 

 
Unintentionally, this left a good impression on many businesses.
 

 
Although there was this minor pirated content issue, the fact that Tong Zhao appeared on the cover of WeatherVane still successfully shook the entire internet...
 

 
Even those who never cared about the entertainment industry or didn’t watch blockbuster movies were now aware of this big news!
 

 
What?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s side business is investing? She made a lot of money?
 

 
That’s not surprising...
 

 
Don’t celebrities usually make a lot of money?
 

 
Wait, the apps I use daily like Xiao Yang Companion, Huanhui Video, Meitu Master, etc., were all funded by ZeShan Venture Capital? Ordinary people, who thought investment had nothing to do with them, were amazed and fascinated by the fact that “I’m actually using projects that Tong Zhao invested in,” and were eager to learn more.
 

 
They suddenly felt more involved, like they were the seed in this big fruit.
 

 
The more they learned, the more they discovered a new side of Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so impressive…]
 

 
[I always thought ZeShan sounded familiar—didn’t my dad always talk about this genius investment firm?]
 

 
[Wow, many of these projects have the potential to go public. Sister Zhao is amazing!]
 

 
[Before working with Tong Zhao, Young Master Wei seemed to be losing money a lot. Looks like it’s really Sister Zhao who helped him turn things around.]
 

 
[Got it. I used to think she was just marrying into wealth, but now I realize the rich guy is the one holding on to her.]
 

 
[All I want to know is, does the scumbag dad regret it? He let go of the golden leg.]
 

 
Speaking of the scumbag dad, netizens remembered the issue about full payments and loans for buying houses, which was mentioned earlier by Bala Media.
 

 
Intrigued, netizens dug a little deeper and found another juicy tidbit.
 

 
@EntertainmentExposer:
 

 
Netizens discovered that the down payment for the Long Xuan A1 unit was enough to buy two of Xu Zhu’s pre-marriage homes outright. /laughing/ /laughing/
 

 
They even included photos.
 

 
Although the photos were of the same unit type, the differences between the two were immediately apparent. Given the high attention around this tidbit, some interested parties analyzed the scale and estimated profits of Tong Zhenming’s company, concluding that: [Even if the scumbag dad sold his blood, he wouldn’t be able to buy the Long Xuan A1 unit outright. Paying in installments would be just as difficult.]
 

 
Now, no one felt sorry for Tong Zhao anymore.
 

 
Instead, people found her family of clowns laughable.
 

 
Many children who had been mistreated by their birth families could relate to Tong Zhao and felt the same satisfaction as reading a "feel-good" story.
 

 
[Every time Tong Zhao steps out of her circle, she does so in such a unique way…]
 

 
[Shocking the whole company.]
 

 
[Upstairs 1, not gonna lie, my boss, who’s obsessed with stock trading, has already started worshiping her as the Goddess of Wealth.]
 

 
If this wasn’t enough of a reality check, then the WeChat conversation records that Wei Zekai shared further confirmed that Tong Zhao was indeed the true decision-maker behind ZeShan Venture Capital.
 

 
@Wei Zekai v:
 

 
Some content that’s no longer considered commercial secrets.
 

 
Just consider it a fan benefit, hoping more people can get to know her other side.
 

 
The nine-grid chat screenshots were taken from the ZeShan management group, showing Tong Zhao making decisions and giving directions. From the founding of ZeShan to their latest investments, these screenshots proved that each project bore Tong Zhao’s stamp of approval.
 

 
Some comments even teased about their relationship, asking what the connection was between them.
 

 
Wei Zekai personally replied to one such comment: [We're partners and super good friends.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai might not know, but answering like that makes the ship even more shippable.]
 

 
[Don’t ask, just know they’re partners.]
 

 
[Got it, it’s real!]
 

 
……
 

 
With nothing else to do, Wei Zekai had to retreat offline and play dead.
 

 
At this point, the big gossip had reached a resolution.
 

 
Later, ZeShan's second-generation rich members posted on Weibo about the housewarming gifts they gave to Tong Zhao—expensive furniture and useful gadgets. Wei Zekai had given her an Italian Baxter sofa, which cost at least a million yuan if imported, a full set of Gaggenau kitchen appliances, and high-end audio and video equipment... He had put a lot of thought into the gift, since future private meetings would likely be held at her home.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a new movie coming out, and of course, she would need a place to watch it.
 

 
Her home was the perfect gathering spot.
 

 
Moreover, all the second-generation rich had made a lot of money through ZeShan, so they didn’t have to worry about their family’s disapproval. Some even saw their status at home rise because of their connection to ZeShan... Everyone wanted a piece of the pie and asked Tong Zhao what projects she was currently interested in.
 

 
They knew they’d have a chance to enjoy the benefits together, so the gifts were particularly lavish.
 

 
The gossip still had some lingering buzz as netizens discovered...
 

 
If we’re talking about being favored, then Tong Zhao was indeed adored by the rich young heirs!
 

 
However, calling her a little princess seemed a bit beneath her.
 

 
At the very least, she was at the queen level.
 

 
The agent and the company closely monitored the big data and found that Tong Zhao's popularity and public favorability had significantly increased, and her fanbase had seen another breakthrough. However, the number of male fans had slightly declined—some male users seemed unable to accept her strong ability to run a company. This was a strange phenomenon because, in the past, there had been female stars who were famous for their high fees, but this kind of "unfollowing" phenomenon never occurred before...
 

 
The final analysis suggested that when female stars become wealthy because of their beauty, acting skills, and sex appeal, it doesn't trigger the insecurity and resentment of male fans. However, when a female star achieves remarkable success in what they perceive as a male-dominated field, they cannot accept it.
 

 
"It doesn't matter,"
 

 
Sister Chu scoffed, bringing this PR matter to a close. She then turned to ask her assistant, "Would you consider this as ‘purifying’ Tong Zhao's fanbase?"
 

 
"Purifying" a fanbase usually refers to turning group fans (such as those who follow a group or a couple) into solo fans (or "only fans")—often involving marketing strategies and tactics that disappoint group fans, making them feel sympathy for the idol and thereby making the fanbase more loyal to the individual member.
 

 
Tong Zhao's "purification"?
 

 
It was more like driving away the low-minded individuals who couldn't stand seeing a female celebrity succeed in business.
 

 
"I don't think so," the assistant hesitated.
 

 
"Ultimately, it's a good thing—it reduces the harassment from color-based hate messages," Sister Chu concluded.
 

 
With the storm subsiding, Tong Zhao was granted a week off to rest. During this time, she handled some business affairs for ZeShan Venture Capital. The agent believed that Tong Zhao's exposure in the first half of the year was sufficient, and her position in the industry was now almost unshakeable. Her momentum was at its peak. With the highly anticipated film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ waiting to be released, she no longer needed to shoot variety shows and dramas back to back as she had before.
 

 
Her status was solidified, so now it was time to cultivate a higher profile.
 

 
After waiting, the film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was finally edited and began its promotional phase.
 

 
Tong Zhao had gained experience in promotional events, and there was nothing special about this round of marketing—just the same old routine. The only downside was that her brief but enjoyable holiday was coming to an end, as ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was a big-budget production, meaning the promotional tour would likely require a nationwide run.
 

 
Then came a phone call from Sister Chu, her tone subtle and somewhat complicated, as if something unbelievable had happened:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, did you agree to a ‘friendly sparring’ with Jiang Dang...?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the sofa eating watermelon with a friend, had her hand slip and the watermelon fell to the floor.
# Chapter95
After asking more questions, Tong Zhao finally understood the whole situation.
 

 
Let’s rewind the timeline to a day earlier.
 

 
Normally, when it comes to movie promotions, the actor’s agent will coordinate the schedule — deciding what to do and where to go at specific times. A series of arrangements must be made in advance, and some smaller stars might use this massive exposure opportunity to secure some individual bookings.
 

 
Both Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao had long passed this stage.
 

 
After the completion ceremony, when the draft of the promotional announcement was being prepared, the company asked if the artist had any thoughts or suggestions. Tong Zhao was only interested in making the movie. Once the film was completed, it was like an author filling in a plot hole — the project became just another finished task. She had feelings about the project, of course, but anything further was just business. So, she nonchalantly handed everything over to her agent.
 

 
This made Sister Chu both happy and a little regretful.
 

 
She was happy because Tong Zhao trusted her so much, but she was regretful because Tong Zhao didn’t have much interest in the promotion.
 

 
On the other hand, Jiang Dang took the promotional campaign very seriously and made suggestions.
 

 
This caused Jiang Dang’s agent, Aaron, to feel his heart leap to his throat.
 

 
When Jiang Dang proposed a live-streamed free-fight match with Tong Zhao, Aaron’s heart sank even further.
 

 
It felt like it had dropped to the floor.
 

 
“Bro, are you serious?” Aaron’s attitude dramatically shifted. “Have you regained your character’s memory? Didn’t we fight enough in the movie?”
 

 
Of course, as one of the few who had seen the original cut of the movie, Aaron knew the underlying meaning of this question — ‘Didn’t you already get enough of a beating in the film?’ Jiang Dang turned around and gave him a look full of unspoken emotion, his tone soft and lingering, “In the movie, the action designer was in control, so it wasn’t really me fighting; it was a stunt double, no esports spirit there.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wasn’t that obvious?
 

 
Without the stunt coordinator enhancing your moves, without the action designer manipulating you, you’d have been knocked out by Tong Zhao in an instant — and what would be left to act?
 

 
And what’s with the "esports spirit"?
 

 
Aaron tried his best to hold back, but finally couldn’t take it anymore:
 

 
“Aren’t you just good at playing Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan? What does esports spirit have to do with you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan has professional leagues, you know.”
 

 
His voice was magnetic and alluring, but when he spoke casually, there was often an inexplicable tone, as if he were intentionally acting cute. Aaron, being another man, didn’t get the appeal and found it a bit cringy, but Jiang Dang remained oblivious, still using his beautiful voice, which had conquered the entire new generation of Chinese-language pop music, to act cute: “She agreed to fight me. If you don’t believe me, ask her.”
 

 
His tone was almost one of mock indignation.
 

 
The rejection from the agent spun around in Jiang Dang's vast mind like an endless universe. He didn’t know what kind of scenario he had imagined, but the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. His emotions were written all over his handsome face, the deep, perfect lines of his features tightening slightly. His mischievous and noble aura made him seem like a demon lord from a fantasy film, whose mere glance could cause heads to roll…
 

 
Jiang Dang pulled out his phone, his long, distinct fingers slowly typing out a message…
 

 
“What are you writing?”
 

 
The agent leaned over to take a look. It was the page for posting on his official Weibo account.
 

 
[Want, to, fight, a, woman…]
 

 
The agent quickly snatched the phone away, his temples throbbing. He realized this guy had somehow cracked the password to his official Weibo account… Yes, while others tend to talk too much, Jiang Dang was someone who would mess up after saying just one sentence. So, in order to better manage his public image and avoid being misunderstood because of his unusual way of expressing himself (the phrase “want to fight a woman” actually didn’t imply any hatred towards women, it was just a random emotional outburst he had when thinking about sparring with Tong Zhao), the agent had worked hard to keep Jiang Dang’s Weibo secure.
 

 
But honestly, this guy had such low emotional intelligence, how did he manage to be so skillful in weird areas?
 

 
Not only was he a semi-professional player of Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan (a mobile game), but he had also been a hacker.
 

 
Jiang Dang had once explained it to him with an air of mystery.
 

 
— Because in the world of 0s and 1s, there aren't as many twists and turns. It’s much easier to understand than the world of ordinary people.
 

 
The agent didn’t understand C language.
 

 
All he got from Jiang Dang’s statement was that it sounded like some bizarre philosophical rambling.
 

 
“You post this kind of content, people will think you’re a misogynist,” the agent said, trying to suppress his urge to pinch his ear. “Even if you're talking about something else, this kind of statement should never come from a public figure. It can lead to misunderstandings.”
 

 
After five minutes of lecturing, Jiang Dang finally admitted that he now understood the inappropriateness of what he had written.
 

 
He may have low emotional intelligence, but he didn’t want to encourage others to hurt women, or have his female fans go around hurting men to please him... That thought was horrifying, so he needed to be careful with his words. After getting his phone back, he sincerely apologized, “Thanks for the reminder.”
 

 
The apology was very sincere.
 

 
One could feel that he was genuinely sorry.
 

 
The agent breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
Sigh, Jiang Dang was a little insane, but he wasn’t a bad person.
 

 
Just as the agent was feeling some relief, he saw that Jiang Dang had deleted the original text and replaced it with something new:
 

 
[Want, to, be, hit, by, a, woman…]
 

 
…
 

 
The agent nearly choked on his breath, almost unable to catch it.
 

 
Jiang Dang, with his innocent look on his face, looked so good that it was infuriating.
 

 
After spending so much time with him, the agent had come to understand his thoughts. Saying he wanted to “fight a woman” might encourage fans to do something bad, but saying he wanted to “be hit by a woman” should be fine, right? Little genius! The agent sternly prepared to lecture him, but when Jiang Dang looked at him with those long eyelashes and delicate phoenix eyes, the agent’s heart skipped a beat, and he found himself changing his words, “Fine, Brother Dang, I was wrong. I’ll arrange it for you, just don’t mess with me anymore, my heart can’t handle it.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Yay!”
 

 
…
 

 
Agent: “Yay my ass!”
 

 
…
 

 
After quietly listening to Sister Chu explain the situation to her, Tong Zhao came to a conclusion: “So, the publicity team has decided to have me and Jiang Dang do a live-streamed free-fight match, right?”
 

 
"Yes..."
 

 
Sister Chu’s voice was tinged with helplessness. "Do you want me to reject it for you?"
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly. "No need. I did promise him, so if we’re fighting, then let’s fight."
 

 
After all, she wasn’t going to lose.
 

 
"Actually, it sounds kind of interesting. What do you think Jiang Dang has in his head?"
 

 
Sister Chu was stumped.
 

 
It was probably a question that no one in the entire entertainment industry could answer.
 

 
But because no one knew the real answer, Jiang Dang’s devoted fans were very eager to give him all sorts of strange personas, as if he were an oddly beautiful egg, with poets daydreaming that inside the egg was an entire universe.
 

 
The two shifted the topic and discussed other schedule arrangements.
 

 
"Alright, I understand. No problem."
 

 
After finishing the call, Tong Zhao looked up and met the curious eyes that were trying hard to control their curiosity.
 

 
With money, even ghosts can grind the mill. Tong Zhao’s house was renovated at an unbelievably fast pace, and at the same time, it became the headquarters for ZeShan Venture Capital. Contrary to some malicious speculation about how lonely a single woman must be living in a large apartment, her friends were more than happy to stay at her place and hang out every day—it was luxurious and comfortable. The agent hired cleaning staff and a chef through reliable channels to live with her and take care of her meals and any catering needs for guests.
 

 
For example, when her friends came over, they could have fresh fried chicken, fries, and popcorn made right on the spot.
 

 
Sometimes, when Tong Zhao was on work calls, her fearless friends would quietly wait for her to finish, knowing the drill.
 

 
One of the second-generation rich kids couldn’t hold back any longer. "What do you mean by 'fight'? Is it a game?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
Tong Zhao explained the entire situation from start to finish, then commented, "He’s a strange person, but not unpleasant. He seems to be the type who follows his own temperament… a creative singer, an artistic person with a certain nature. He’s interesting to talk to, always able to surprise people. He’s quite fun."
 

 
When following his nature to the extreme, it could turn into selfishness.
 

 
Building his own satisfaction on the suffering of others.
 

 
Jiang Dang managed to control this balance very well. It seemed that, in addition to having a broad mind, he also had decent upbringing. During their multiple collaborations on ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Tong Zhao’s impressions of him were generally good, and she could feel his intense desire to compete in the film. She figured it was fine to indulge him a little.
 

 
"Besides, this angle creates a lot of buzz and has a positive impact on the movie’s promotion."
 

 
After she finished speaking, she hummed and laughed. "Seems like compared to him, I’m actually quite pragmatic."
 

 
After discussing Jiang Dang for a while, the group shifted their focus and headed to the game room to play multiplayer video games.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned back on the sofa and said she would go over later.
 

 
Wei Zekai stayed behind to keep her company.
 

 
"Come on, speak up."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow. "Speak about what?"
 

 
"You've got a lot on your mind, it’s almost written on your face. And you’re asking me what to say?"
 

 
Tong Zhao reached out and pinched his face.
 

 
It was a shame. When he was younger, his chubby cheeks were fun to pinch, but now his face had slimmed down so much that there wasn’t much flesh to grab. Though his sharp, well-defined features were more pronounced, the fun of pinching his little chubby cheeks was gone. Tong Zhao pinched his face while voicing her thoughts, but Wei Zekai disagreed.
 

 
"I'm not skinny, alright? I’ve got plenty of muscle."
 

 
"Where?"
 

 
Wei Zekai lifted his shirt, revealing a perfectly sculpted set of abs.
 

 
With just a little tension, the tattoo on his side near his obliques became visible as his muscles tightened.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick glance, her voice flat as she deadpanned, "Mmm, so impressive. So sexy."
 

 
Wei Zekai saw right through her indifference. "Can you at least pretend to be surprised?"
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I can’t help it. Lately, I’ve been shooting photos in the studio, and, well... there are male models everywhere, shirtless, and they look good too."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Three giant exclamation marks seemed to practically leap out of Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
He was upset. Very upset.
 

 
"They look better than me?"
 

 
Not really.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s looks could easily get him into the entertainment industry. His features were refined enough to be on a whole different level.
 

 
But they were all good-looking guys, and to get better shooting results, they would all work on their muscles before going on set (muscles look especially good after a workout, so it’s a thing among straight guys who take selfies at the gym), some even applied oil to enhance the visual effect…
 

 
Tong Zhao caught the defeat in her friend’s tone and quickly changed the subject, "Why compare yourself to models? You’re the best-looking."
 

 
Although Wei Zekai was prone to irritation, he was also easy to calm down.
 

 
When Tong Zhao said he was the best-looking, he believed her.
 

 
Within two sentences, he dropped the subject and said, "By the way, Jiang Dang wants to fight you... how come you agreed to it? I haven’t even had a chance to fight you yet."
 

 
Aha, now he was really getting into it.
 

 
Tong Zhao grabbed a handful of milk candies from the coffee table and handed them to him. "Have some candy to keep that mouth of yours shut. Are you asking to get beaten?"
 

 
"I just feel like others have done things with you, but I haven’t, and it’s a bit annoying."
 

 
And if you did...?
 

 
Tong Zhao slowed down her thoughts, which had been racing at seventy miles per hour.
# Chapter96
After all, martial arts values peace and harmony, and one must uphold martial ethics, not engage in internal struggles.
 

 
Although he had bruises in three places, Wei Zekai was still in high spirits and went to play games with the other friends. This left Tong Zhao feeling puzzled. After two lifetimes, she didn’t know that Wei Zekai was actually a bit of a masochist? However, emotionally, it made sense. He probably felt that only close friends could have that kind of playful interaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a short nap on the sofa.
 

 
What she didn’t know was that Wei Zekai had gone to boast to the other friends.
 

 
Second-generation C: "Did you fight back?"
 

 
"Of course!"
 

 
Wei Zekai took the game controller: "I wasn’t trying to get beaten up. It was just a friendly spar!"
 

 
"Did you really fight back? Your brain doesn’t work that well, you didn’t hurt our Sister Zhao, right?" Hearing this, second-generation A asked nervously, looking as though he wanted to punch Wei Zekai himself. Some of them had noticed that his relationship with Sister Zhao was different, and they silently thought, is this how you create time for them to be alone? How reassuring...
 

 
"I did fight back, but I didn’t win. She's really good."
 

 
At this point, Wei Zekai's thin lips curled into a slightly smug smile, his face clearly in a good mood.
 

 
No one really understood what he was so proud of, but everyone agreed that Tong Zhao was amazing. This chapter of events was easily closed for everyone.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, she managed to get a good sleep right at the end of the holiday.
 

 
Since becoming famous, she had been under constant scrutiny. For safety and image reasons, she inevitably distanced herself from the crowd. As Kafka said, a person who lives in solitude needs a window facing an alley, so the sounds of her friends joking around in the game room served as the best white noise, lulling her into a deep, safe, and peaceful sleep.
 

 
Aside from that, she asked for nothing more.
 

 
...
 

 
The holiday ended, and after two promotional events, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ began its nationwide tour, which was almost as intense as a nationwide performance tour. The schedule was very packed, testing the physical stamina of all the roadshow staff. The only time they could rest was while traveling by car or airplane, but could they really rest well in such a small space? Clearly, they could not. So, aside from putting on bright smiles when facing the audience, nearly everyone had the same exhausted expression.
 

 
Especially during some pre-screening events.
 

 
Because spoilers couldn’t be given, the topics of conversation with the audience were often irrelevant.
 

 
They could only talk about local food or scenic spots, and then end with a group photo.
 

 
But when it came to food and scenery...
 

 
There was simply no time to eat, drink, or play—there was no time to even sleep!
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Each time they went on tour, all the roadshow members were shocked by Tong Zhao’s incredible stamina and good appetite. Her food intake wasn't particularly large, but during the last event of the day, when the promotional activities might go on until midnight, by the time everyone returned to their accommodations, they were too tired to have any appetite. The staff would take a few bites of food and call it a meal, and the stars, in order to maintain their figures, ate even less—those few pieces of salad leaves were practically the same as not eating, and anything with too much oil or salt was impossible to stomach. Plus, they had to get up early for the next morning’s event.
 

 
But what was Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
After confirming there wouldn't be any emergencies, she would visit local snack streets and famous restaurants in every city. She would even bring back bags of snacks, many of which would be eaten by the staff during the ride.
 

 
So, since they couldn’t talk about the movie content or give spoilers during the pre-screening events, the conversation would often turn to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Where’s a good place nearby to visit?
 

 
What’s delicious to eat?
 

 
She was the only one who could keep the conversation going.
 

 
“There’s a really good pig’s stomach chicken restaurant nearby? Hmm, I’ve been there. What stood out to me the most was the bamboo fungus inside, it’s much longer than regular bamboo fungus. I personally recommend the Shunde fish skin dumplings.”
 

 
“I went there at midnight. We spent all day doing the roadshow, so some of the places were closed, but the snack street stays open really late.”
 

 
“I’ve been to the beach at dawn. The water quality is really good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao kept in mind that during the promotional period, she needed to increase her exposure and couldn’t stay too low-key. So, she happily took selfies whenever she went out and posted them on her Weibo in the same grid-style format. However, she only posted pictures from a city after leaving for the next one, which made it impossible for her enthusiastic fans to track her down. They had no choice but to obediently follow the roadshow.
 

 
Once the movie promotion period began, it was the happiest time for her fans.
 

 
[Today, I found another high-intensity 9-grid post!]
 

 
[More swimsuit pics! I don’t need this bit of traffic qwq]
 

 
[I saw something! It’s the hot pot grid from her 9-grid Weibo, I’m starving! Sister Zhao, where are you going next? Will you come to my hometown?]
 

 
The person saying this was a soft girl, and Tong Zhao happened to be scrolling through Weibo when she replied: [You didn’t even say where your hometown is, sis.]
 

 
Not only did she reply, but she also called her "sis," which made the female fan so excited she nearly fainted.
 

 
Tong Zhao's bold presence naturally triggered some criticism.
 

 
Like many celebrities with high traffic and hot topics, it’s impossible to be loved by everyone online; instead, there will always be discussions—along with true fans, there will be genuine haters. Love can come unexpectedly, and hate can be just as passionate.
 

 
So, what’s the angle this time?
 

 
It’s that Tong Zhao isn’t taking her work seriously, neglecting the roadshow to go off and have fun.
 

 
This criticism isn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
Netizens who don’t understand the roadshow process might think that it’s normal to eat and play a bit while traveling between cities. But anyone who understands the promotional tour for a movie would know that this is nearly impossible. There was an instance where more than 20 main creators were divided into three groups, traveling to nearly 100 cities across the country in 35 days, completing 500 promotional events. Just hearing the scale of that workload shows how tight the schedule is.
 

 
Of course, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t quite that extreme, but it wasn’t far off.
 

 
If the roadshow has strong feedback, the investors will increase funding.
 

 
So, there are movies where the main creative team’s effort in running roadshows leads to a successful turnaround.
 

 
If one or two photos are showing that they squeezed in a bit of time for leisure, it might be excusable. But to visit every city? It couldn’t be that the whole crew is waiting for her to have fun, could it?
 

 
Some netizens compiled Tong Zhao’s recent Weibo posts.
 

 
Sure enough, she posted photos of her enjoying herself in each city. During the roadshow, she still found time to visit shops. It seemed almost like a spiritual mystery.
 

 
Some haters seized on this point, criticizing her for being unprofessional.
 

 
After all, wasn’t it just recently that she used a month of seclusion to build her "dedicated" persona?
 

 
Fans who understood the process didn’t know how to defend her. They could only weakly reply: "The core duty of an actor is to deliver a good performance, and post-production promotion and pre-filming work shouldn’t be considered the same thing to criticize."
 

 
The haters triumphantly retorted: "Why isn’t it the same? Stars with more clout than her are still doing the roadshows properly. Why is it that when it comes to her, it’s a nationwide tour?"
 

 
Fans were infuriated!
 

 
But they couldn’t bear to tell Tong Zhao to stop playing and focus on the roadshow.
 

 
They could only mute the microphone and quietly repeat their anticipation for her new film to release.
 

 
This small public opinion storm did attract some attention from the industry. Since it was during the movie’s promotional period, the creative team naturally wouldn’t let any dirt be thrown on them without responding. Tong Zhao, who brought in attention with her presence, posted roadshow photos that garnered more attention, which benefited the movie. This minor controversy, if handled well, could serve as free promotion.
 

 
First, the official Weibo account of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ listed the roadshow schedule and stated that Tong Zhao had never been late or left early.
 

 
Then, they bought a marketing account to clarify from a third-party perspective.
 

 
@EntertainmentFrontline:
 

 
A netizen pointed out that in Tong Zhao’s “roadshow travel diary,” the photos were all taken late at night or in the early morning hours, without taking up work time. It seems that for the sake of fun, Sister Zhao really worked hard!
 

 
[Screenshot]
 

 
At first glance, the photos are indeed from unusual hours.
 

 
The popular shops Tong Zhao visited were mostly open until late at night.
 

 
There were also fan reports from roadshow attendees who mentioned that when Tong Zhao met with fans, she didn’t look tired or sleep-deprived at all. In fact, she appeared to be in great spirits, indicating that her balance of work and leisure was effective!
 

 
There were also on-site photos to support this.
 

 
When netizens saw them, they seemed to believe it was true.
 

 
Since it didn’t affect her work, aside from the extreme haters who needed to fabricate stories to criticize her, no one else was fixated on the issue anymore.
 

 
The main creators and Sister Chu worked together to clarify the situation, which led to a round of positive publicity.
 

 
Originally, the matter would have been forgotten.
 

 
But then Jiang Dang posted on Weibo.
 

 
@JiangDangv:
 

 
"I want Tong Zhao to take me for hotpot... She made me get up at 3 a.m..."
 

 
His agent changed his Weibo password, but he cracked it and regained control of his account once again.
 

 
It’s rare for him to use his main account, and Jiang Dang also enjoys internet fame.
 

 
[So, did you go?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: No, I couldn’t get up.
 

 
[Couldn’t you go by yourself?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: If I went by myself, my agent would tell me to bring a bodyguard. I didn’t want to trouble anyone to work overtime.
 

 
Why doesn’t he need a bodyguard if Tong Zhao goes with him???
 

 
Many netizens flooded the comment section with their doubts.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Go watch my new movie, and you’ll understand."
 

 
Wow, now he’s promoting his own movie—fans were so moved they nearly cried.
 

 
Of course, "actively responding" Jiang Dang lasted only one afternoon before his agent changed his password to something even more complicated, turning it into a battle of wits and making it all the more fun.
 

 
With this side explanation, netizens became more convinced that Tong Zhao wasn’t unprofessional; she just really can do it all.
 

 
The topic then shifted to how much sleep Tong Zhao actually gets in a day.
 

 
…
 

 
The photographer, following the roadshow, was exhausted and almost collapsed. When she saw Tong Zhao heading out, she originally planned to force herself to stay alert to take pictures, but Tong Zhao said it wasn’t necessary—she’d handle it herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao would place her camera, which had a timer function, casually on tree trunks or railings, acting as her own photographer. The photos she took turned out well enough, mainly because of the great material; no matter what angle she shot from, it looked good.
 

 
Her fans were calling for more swimsuit photos, which were actually quite casual.
 

 
In the photos, Tong Zhao wore loose beige pants and a black bikini top, her waist gracefully blending into the pants. In the distance, the dark blue waves, separated by rocky cliffs, met the brightly lit food street. Tong Zhao’s long hair flowed in the wind, the moonlight and stars reflected in her eyes, almost as if it were a beam of frozen light. It was so stunning, it could captivate anyone.
 

 
It was so beautiful.
 

 
The key wasn’t her slender figure, which looked like it had been shaped by hunger. Wearing the bikini, she confidently showed off her abdominal muscles, clearly a sign of well-developed core strength, but it didn’t detract from the overall beauty.
 

 
When talking about Tong Zhao and mentioning this star, it’s inevitable to think about her latest work.
 

 
Isn't it an action film?
 

 
Combining that with the movie she’s currently promoting...
 

 
If female stars work so hard on their physiques, how could the action scenes not be exciting?
 

 
Fans have already started asking those who attended the pre-screening roadshows, "Did Tong Zhao wear anything more revealing during her fight scenes in the movie?"
 

 
"Anyone seen the pre-screening of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’? How’s Tong Zhao’s fight scenes? Does she have chemistry with the male lead? Any predictions for the box office?"
 

 
[Male lead? No need for one, with Tong Zhao in the movie. She’s the only lead; the other guy is just the 'lead's boyfriend.']
 

 
[I feel like the chemistry with her boyfriend isn’t as strong as the one with Fu Xuancheng.]
 

 
[Fu Xuancheng played by Jiang Dang? Honestly, it’s pretty surprising that they invited him to play this role. I think his subconscious might be even more unstable than Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
The discussion got so heated that by the time they reached the 100th comment, the audience who had actually seen the film finally showed up with their reviews.
 

 
"Thanks for the invite, just got out of the screening. Director Shi really picked the right person for this challenge. For a modern martial arts film, it exceeded expectations. The pleasant surprise was that Tong Zhao actually suited this kind of comedy with a bit of a funny element? I originally thought her face would be too serious and not funny at all, but she was pretty interesting. The costumes, makeup, and set design were all top-notch. After the screening, the creators said that many of the weapons used were original designs and that they were considering renting them out to other productions after the film finishes. They really put a lot of effort into it."
 

 
"I'm just a casual fan of Jiang Dang, but he's so funny! I feel like only his subconscious could pull off that quirky, stubborn character. And the way he interacts with Tong Zhao... Ah, I can’t spoil it! Just go see it, one movie is all it takes to turn into a fan!"
 

 
"What’s going on with Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao? Don’t just leave it halfway like that."
 

 
"Basically, I’m shipping them now."
 

 
Spoilers couldn’t be stopped. Curious fans scrolled through to the highlighted spoilers and related Weibo posts, piecing together one thing:
 

 
Jiang Dang got beaten up.
 

 
So, what’s the deal with this beating?
 

 
Confusing, I don’t get it.
 

 
It wasn’t until the roadshow ended that a new promotional activity was launched:
 

 
"Tong Zhao accepts Jiang Dang’s challenge and will have an exclusive 1v1 live broadcast of free fighting on Eagle Vision Platform on [Month] [Day]!”
# Chapter97
1v1 Free Fighting?
 

 
Immediately, a ring appeared in the minds of the netizens.
 

 
On opposite sides of the ring stood Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, both striking ready boxing poses.
 

 
...
 

 
The scene was so vivid that the netizens felt a little dizzy.
 

 
Soon after, the official Weibo account released "promotional photos" of the two of them preparing for the fight. Tong Zhao, dressed in a sports vest, showed off her great figure, which netizens dubbed the "most natural" among female stars. Some curious users even compared her body to that of other female celebrities who debuted around the same time. While she might not be the thinnest, she was undoubtedly the most toned and fit.
 

 
[Forget female celebrities, even some young idols don't manage their bodies as well as she does.]
 

 
Some netizens shared screenshots from a swimming variety show, where several handsome young male celebrities had soft and untoned bodies. They weren’t fat, but the metabolism of young men was high, and even without much exercise, their legs were still notably slim.
 

 
It was clear they lacked exercise, which made them less appetizing to look at.
 

 
Even a little muscle tone could set one apart from their peers by a mile.
 

 
Fans, by contrast, often indulged and were too lazy to work out.
 

 
After all, as long as they wore clothes, looking good in the face was enough. If not, post-production could always help fix things.
 

 
[This girl who went out at 3 AM to eat hotpot could have that kind of body?]
 

 
[Got it, spicy food speeds up metabolism, so hotpot is a weight-loss food /dog head.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is truly a time management master!]
 

 
But what about the other photo?
 

 
What surprised netizens was that Jiang Dang's physique was actually quite good.
 

 
In the poster, he had a side profile, and the lighting accentuated his sharp and cold handsome features.
 

 
Jiang Dang's skin tone was pale, seemingly rarely exposed to sunlight.
 

 
After all, the filming for "Instinct" wouldn’t affect his real-life complexion. His hobby was staying home to play video games. Unexpectedly, he had many quiet and refined hobbies. His muscles were the result of his manager telling him to train... He was highly cooperative at work, but sometimes his thinking was a little different from the average person, leading to some hilarious outcomes.
 

 
His body management wasn’t wasted, and it caught the eyes of female fans, who were drooling over him.
 

 
A whole bunch of fangirls below were praising him like he was a "vampire young master" and showering him with compliments, excited about the upcoming performance of both Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang. Some even jokingly wondered if they would release a duet soon.
 

 
Regardless, the hype was definitely there, and it served its purpose in promoting the movie.
 

 
Who has ever seen a movie promotion where the female lead and the antagonist's actor have a real-life offline PK (battle)?
 

 
This is too daring!
 

 
Other movies with concurrent promotions were dumbfounded.
 

 
Some movies had originally thought that having the main cast change into Qing Dynasty costumes during pre-screening warm-up activities would be innovative and creative enough for their promotions. But they didn’t expect that others would take a sharp turn and overtake them... Some promotional teams, not minding being accused of copying others, turned their focus to their own leads.
 

 
But upon reflection, they realized it wouldn't work.
 

 
In a romance movie, having the male and female leads fight each other? Is that even appropriate?
 

 
As for female celebrities in the entertainment industry who could rival Tong Zhao in fighting ability...
 

 
It's hard to think of many.
 

 
With their delicate arms and legs, how could they possibly fight? Wouldn’t their fans tear them apart?
 

 
Instead, now, Jiang Dang’s fans, after learning about Tong Zhao’s fighting skills, were cautiously pleading with her fans on her Weibo, asking her to go easy on him—no punches to the face, no hits to the head, considering he already had some issues to begin with.
 

 
This was a stunt only Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
The industry was in awe.
 

 
Although no one explicitly said it, everyone secretly thought that Tong Zhao was very clever—not only was she pulling stunts on variety shows, but she also dared to engage in such bold operations in real life! No one expected this to have nothing to do with Tong Zhao at all—it was actually Jiang Dang's sudden whim that made the movie's promotion work.
 

 
The promotional effect was so good, and discussions were happening everywhere.
 

 
Wei Zekai, slyly, posted a Weibo saying, "What's the big deal, I’ve already fought with Tong Zhao before."
 

 
Gossip-loving netizens were curious about the outcome.
 

 
@WeiZekaiV: "No comment."
 

 
This mysterious expression was something everyone who knew him could understand—it was obvious he lost the fight, and not only did he fail to fight back, even if he did, it wouldn’t have mattered. Some netizens, taking it seriously, even drew a relationship chart, making it look like a stock market analysis, where Wei Keke was holding steady with his childhood sweetheart, while Jiang Dang was the unexpected, rising star... Some even said...
 

 
[If you like the crazy type, why not consider Shi Qianqiu?]
 

 
[Among these jokers, how normal is Wan Zhi-ge!]
 

 
While waiting for a movie, Song Wanzhuo, surfing the internet, really wanted to say, "Please don’t mention me."
 

 
Recently, he had been seeing Tong Zhao’s action star outfits everywhere, and he was about to unfollow her.
 

 
He wanted his delicate, soft, loving favorite back!
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
Someone asked him what he thought about his beloved Tong Zhao’s new movie, and he casually flipped through his Weibo, showing his support for her: [Watching it in my private holographic theater /smiling face]
 

 
Though he was telling the truth, there was an inexplicable sense of smugness emanating from his words.
 

 
So, the netizens who were following the gossip quickly had their attention diverted by his shameful display of wealth.
 

 
Finally, the day of the live broadcast arrived amid great anticipation.
 

 
The official team had rented a legitimate, large-scale boxing arena. The protective gear, equipment, and the venue were all legal and in compliance with regulations. The promotional photos posted on Weibo beforehand also looked very formal, highlighting the official's serious attitude and piquing the interest of some netizens. While romantic relationships between handsome men and beautiful women are common, it’s rare to see such a scenario where the handsome guy and beautiful girl are fighting each other.
 

 
Though they were called to "fight," it wasn’t entirely accurate.
 

 
When Tong Zhao arrived at the boxing gym, she found that Jiang Dang had already changed into his gear and was warming up. Although he moved slowly, his movements were quite precise. Tong Zhao was a little surprised: "Have you trained before?"
 

 
Muay Thai, karate, and taekwondo are all popular options.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang had challenged her, he must be a martial arts enthusiast with some skills, right?
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Jiang Dang looked up at her with a confused expression, his handsome face showing a hint of, "I have no idea what you're talking about," and replied, "Trained in what? Martial arts? No, just regular fitness stuff."
 

 
"......"
 

 
Wait, what’s with that confusion?
 

 
"Then why did you challenge me to a match?"
 

 
Sitting down, Jiang Dang turned his head back, his thick eyelashes casting shadows over his eyes, and the deep contours of his face disappeared into the darkness as though he was plotting a world-altering conspiracy: "My subconscious is easily influenced by roles. Since I didn’t get enough fighting in the movie, I thought I’d try it in real life."
 

 
Moreover, in the movie, there was a fight choreographer to handle the action scenes, and Jiang Dang felt quite dissatisfied.
 

 
The second half of his sentence, the dissatisfaction, was kept to himself. He didn’t say it out loud, and it made him look a little pitiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she hadn’t asked him this question, she probably would’ve taken him down instantly.
 

 
She was professionally training in martial arts, and her strength was on par with that of heavier men. If she had been serious and ready to fight, it would have taken her only two or three seconds to subdue Jiang Dang. With Duan Ge’s personality, she could have easily taken out an opponent in three seconds. If she had any useful information to extract, she could break his legs or tie him up and ask.
 

 
Duan Ge, with righteous confidence: [The villain dies from talking too much.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [So, you’re putting yourself in the villain’s role now?]
 

 
[Being a villain doesn’t come with many moral burdens,] Duan Ge asked: [So, what do you think? Should I go in for the fight later?]
 

 
Tong Zhao hesitated.
 

 
She felt that sparring with Jiang Dang would be a tough task.
 

 
Since it was a movie promotion, she couldn’t just go up and take him down instantly; the fight needed to look good, with some back-and-forth. Letting him hit her was also an art form in itself, even more complicated than going all out. She wasn’t sure if Duan Ge could handle it, as she only let her female friends win…
 

 
What they were thinking was obvious to each other, and Duan Ge immediately said she could go ahead, letting her take the lead.
 

 
[Alright then…]
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended to reluctantly step aside, letting the main personality take over.
 

 
But she was actually quite willing.
 

 
No one told them that the live broadcast had already begun.
 

 
The official staff had only subtly reminded them that anything that shouldn’t be heard by the public should be kept to themselves once they entered the venue, because the staff at the boxing gym were not under their control and could easily post anything they overheard on Weibo.
 

 
This cute conversation was overheard by the audience who had entered the live stream.
 

 
[Wait, so Jiang Dang was the one who suggested this sparring challenge???]
 

 
[He really showed what it means to have a death wish. Isn't it good enough to be alive?]
 

 
[Hahaha, Tong Zhao's confused expression is too funny! GKDGKD!]
 

 
There were also fans of Jiang Dang praising his physique, saying it wasn’t photoshopped.
 

 
Jiang Dang was the type who looked slimmer when dressed. Usually, he didn’t show off much, but now with his shirt off, his biceps and triceps were well-developed, and his lines were clearly defined. From an appearance standpoint, he seemed to have the upper hand: [Jiang Dang’s body management is on point, the muscle mass is right there. A woman’s punch probably wouldn’t stand a chance.]
 

 
[True, even a guy would struggle with taking that punch.]
 

 
[The two of them aren't even in the same weight class.]
 

 
Aside from the obvious gender difference, boxing matches are also divided into different weight classes, because even if a punch lands in the same spot, the damage and impact are different when thrown by a 200-pound fighter versus a 140-pound fighter.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, it seemed like an unfair match.
 

 
Duan Ge, completely unaware of the ongoing online discussions about her, changed backstage and fully equipped herself, warming up for a bit. Meanwhile, she began to play around with the gym's punching bag equipment.
 

 
The punching bags were solid, and after testing her strength with a few punches, Duan Ge found they could easily withstand her force, so she started putting in more effort.
 

 
A left jab, a right roundhouse kick, and a left cross punch.
 

 
The sound of her strikes was so intense that the staff at the gym turned to look. The live stream’s comments were filled with 666666.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so A, I’d love to be hit by her 555555.]
 

 
[I suspect she’s the most attractive M-type female celebrity.]
 

 
[I feel like one of her kicks could knock my head off...]
 

 
Admiration for strength is a human instinct.
 

 
Watching Tong Zhao’s pre-match performance, it seemed to hint that an exciting match was about to unfold. The audience in the live stream was getting excited, their anticipation growing. Some couldn’t hold back and started recommending it in their social media posts, calling their friends to come watch.
 

 
There were even betting odds posted on gambling sites about who would win.
 

 
The joys and sorrows of people don’t always align.
 

 
The netizens were celebrating, while Jiang Dang's fans were nervously sweating.
 

 
[Maybe we should just not have the match, I’m so scared qwq]
 

 
[Don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head.]
 

 
[Will my brother die from one punch?]
 

 
When the two walked onto the stage, the popularity in the live stream soared like crazy. The backstage staff were puzzled and asked each other, “I haven’t started adjusting the backend data yet, have you?”
 

 
It’s an industry unspoken rule that the viewer and audience numbers for live streams can be inflated to make the numbers look good.
 

 
For paid content like variety shows and movies, inflating the numbers is strictly forbidden, so the data is trustworthy. However, since this was a promotional pre-event, slight adjustments to the data wouldn’t be considered illegal. The staff hadn’t even adjusted the numbers yet, but they watched as the figures shot up as if someone had activated a cheat code.
 

 
“No, I haven’t!”
 

 
“I haven’t either.”
 

 
“You’re the only one with access. Did you burn out from overtime or something?”
 

 
The staff member who had asked was met with a barrage of complaints, but his face was full of smiles. “Guess that means this is real data then... feels like a dream. Let’s tweak the keyword data for the comments.”
 

 
This was the best way to see who was pulling in the crowd.
 

 
On the monitoring screen, it was clear who was the King of audience attraction.
 

 
“75% of the comments are related to Tong Zhao…”
 

 
At this point, the staff sighed, “Whoever gets the traffic gets the world. There were people before who complained about Tong Zhao's subconscious instability, but just look at her ability to create buzz—who wouldn’t want her for promotions? She’s so useful. It feels like she can meet any crazy idea. She's so dedicated.”
 

 
“The audience’s interest is what matters.”
 

 
No matter how boring a variety show is, as long as Sister Zhao is there, she can always make something fresh happen.
 

 
“Jiang Dang is more suited for talk shows,” someone commented.
 

 
While the staff discussed her, the timer for the boxing match was struck by the referee.
 

 
Though the official announcement said it would be free fighting, they ultimately chose the more traditional rules of boxing: three-minute rounds, one-minute rest between rounds, ten rounds in total. After being knocked down, the referee would count to ten, and if the knocked-down fighter couldn’t get up within ten seconds, the other would be declared the winner.
 

 
On the live stream, Tong Zhao, with bandages wrapped around her hands, was looking into the camera.
 

 
She jumped twice in place to loosen up.
 

 
Her black hair fell over her face, brushing past her cold, sharp eyes, piercing directly into the hearts of the female audience.
 

 
Even the girlfriend fans who came for Jiang Dang couldn’t help but admit that this sister’s A-game made it hard for them to feel any jealousy or competition. They just wanted to admire her beauty…
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t care.
 

 
She was talking to other personalities.
 

 
Han Zhi reminded her: 【Remember to go easy. It wouldn’t make sense to knock him down in the first round.】
 

 
Tong Zhao also thought she should give Jiang Dang some face.
 

 
If Jiang Dang were the type of man who looked down on women and provocatively challenged them... considering the rest time between rounds, she could have easily taken him down in eleven minutes. But Jiang Dang was more of a spontaneous type. During their roadshows, he had been polite and well-behaved, so she naturally took him into consideration.
 

 
This solo fight wasn’t to determine the winner between the two.
 

 
It was to promote the movie, so it had to look good.
 

 
Duan Ge: [...So what should I do?]
 

 
According to the rules of Japanese anime, a perfect fight should have the structure of a satisfying story—
 

 
The tension of seemingly mismatched opponents, the nervousness of occasional knockdowns, back-and-forth exchanges leading to the crucial moment, the villain boasting of their plans as they unleash their final move, while the protagonist, about to be defeated, explodes with inner power and turns the tables.
 

 
After Tong Zhao explained, Duan Ge: [Oh, so the challenge in this match lies here.]
 

 
With the unreasonable demands from the client, the fight went from being dull and tedious to something much more challenging.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was called over by Xiao Zhao to play with his hands.
 

 
...
 

 
The official live stream played the battle anthem.
 

 
The staff, both onstage and backstage, including Jiang Dang and the audience, were all watching intently.
 

 
In the first three rounds, Duan Ge worked hard to let Jiang Dang have the upper hand.
 

 
The staff at the boxing venue were quietly discussing, but Duan Ge didn’t hear them, since she was too busy handling her own situation—
 

 
Xuyi: [You’re hitting too hard, ease up a bit!]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Hey, stop dodging. It’s not like you’ll be hurt by that little bit of strength.]
 

 
Han Zhi reminded: [Remember to act like it hurts when you’re hit.]
 

 
Unexpectedly, after debuting in action films where she relied on her subconscious for her performance, Tong Zhao was now facing a challenge in acting during a promotional event. Duan Ge had to exert tremendous effort to keep her performance on par with Jiang Dang’s, occasionally showing signs of pain.
 

 
[I thought it would be a one-sided fight, but it’s actually pretty exciting?]
 

 
[It’s a bit entertaining! Tong Zhao’s movements are so agile!]
 

 
[In real life, fighting someone heavier means you have to rely on agility to win. It’s like that.]
 

 
In the back-and-forth tug-of-war, the score was tied.
 

 
By the fifth round, Duan Ge estimated it was time for the "villain laughs maniacally and humiliates the protagonist" scene.
 

 
But she missed one detail.
 

 
After gaining a slight advantage from the leniency, Jiang Dang didn’t boast or flaunt his strength. Instead, his gaze toward her became shy and almost infatuated.
 

 
...
 

 
This is crazy!
 

 
Xuyi: [The opponent isn’t cooperating…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Then let’s move into the counterattack?]
 

 
Han Zhi felt that something was off.
 

 
But Consort Chen, enjoying the chaos, urged Duan Ge to go ahead and hit harder, since she had already been letting him win in the previous rounds.
 

 
The counterattack, Duan Ge was familiar with, and there was no difficulty.
 

 
No more holding back and pretending to be weak, Duan Ge immediately relaxed. As soon as the boxing bell rang, she happily knocked him down in the next five rounds. From the bell ringing to Jiang Dang hitting the ground and the referee counting down the ten seconds...
 

 
It never took more than twenty seconds—it all happened so quickly.
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[What happened to the evenly matched battle??]
 

 
[Ah, so Tong Zhao was holding back earlier?]
 

 
Someone who seemed to have figured out what was going on jumped in to explain: [This is how it is, if they kept the pace of the last five rounds, wouldn’t the whole promotional event be ruined? So it must have been the director's request to let him win earlier.]
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had just finished playing with Xiao Zhao’s hands, ruffled her memory: [Didn't I tell you not to hit him too hard?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Don’t worry, he’s not hurt!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Then what about holding back?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I held back! I let him win several rounds earlier!]
 

 
...Well, it didn’t seem like there was a problem, except she forgot to continue the act in the later rounds.
 

 
The promotional team, unfairly blamed by the audience as the hidden force behind it all, felt wronged.
 

 
Jiang Dang didn’t last more than twenty seconds in the last five rounds, his body wasn’t badly injured, but he was dazed and looked a little downcast. His fans were worried and kept asking in the comments if he had been knocked silly.
 

 
The host also asked with concern: "Jiang Dang looks unhappy. Is it because he lost?"
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head and, with a hurt expression, looked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
“She let me win… I wanted her to really fight me…”
 

 
He sounded particularly wronged.
 

 
The fans, who had been worried just moments ago, paused for a second.
 

 
[Does he want to be knocked out?]
 

 
[So, am I following a star just to watch my house get flattened by Sister Zhao?]
 

 
[I think he’s really been knocked silly…]
# Chapter98
Due to the dramatic comeback by Duan Ge in the last five rounds...
 

 
The original livestream duration was no longer enough!
 

 
Everything happened so quickly.
 

 
The host, following the original plan, began asking both sides for their post-match thoughts.
 

 
Host: "Brother Dang, how do you feel right now?"
 

 
"Not enough."
 

 
Jiang Dang's physical stamina was good. It was said that he usually trains his lung capacity through swimming and running—though this was more of an urban legend, as lung capacity has no direct connection to singing ability. What mattered more was vocal technique. However, his ability to sing for five to six hours straight with a steady voice, and the fact that his voice had thickness and layers, was often praised by his fans.
 

 
After going through such high-intensity physical activity, Jiang Dang was still sitting on the bench with only a thin layer of sweat on his forehead and neck. The lights of the boxing gym reflected off him, his delicate and slightly devilish features carrying an unspoken vulnerability, which only solidified his title as the "top beauty" of the music world.
 

 
The host's lips subtly twitched, unable to hold back the truth:
 

 
"Wouldn't it have been better if you had lasted a little longer?"
 

 
"Yeah," Jiang Dang said without feeling offended, answering gently, "She's too amazing. When she got serious, I had no way to fight back."
 

 
Host: "Is it the same feeling you had when filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’?"
 

 
"When we were filming, the action designer helped me a lot, and it wasn't about my own abilities," Jiang Dang answered, remembering his manager’s reminder to always promote the movie, and added, "So, the audience can rest assured, the character Fu Xuancheng in the movie is not as weak as I am."
 

 
...You know you're weak!
 

 
The host almost couldn’t suppress his urge to make a sarcastic comment.
 

 
However, many entertainers, in an effort to take all the credit and glory for themselves, often deliberately avoid talking about action designers or voice actors during interviews—while not explicitly stating that those cool moves were not entirely their own subconscious abilities, the hard work of these behind-the-scenes professionals is often overlooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s active mention of this, however, made the host and some colleagues appreciate him a bit more.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang was so cooperative, the host steered the conversation back to the movie, cleverly plugging it. The viewers watching this were curious too, and began discussing the gap in combat skills between the two:
 

 
[The action designer worked hard. It must have taken a lot of effort to close that gap.]
 

 
[They probably set some limitations for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is the real-life heroine!]
 

 
Isn’t that right? Beautiful and tough, she fulfills many people's fantasy of a female hero.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick battle shower in the changing room, dried her hair, applied makeup, and changed into casual clothes before stepping out, where she was immediately greeted by the host's bright smile.
 

 
"Finished interviewing Jiang Dang?" she asked.
 

 
The host nodded and said it was her turn now.
 

 
She greeted the audience in the livestream.
 

 
Tong Zhao appeared in a white T-shirt and hot pants, smiling brightly at the camera. Fans on the bullet screen immediately flooded the chat with passionate declarations of love.
 

 
Host: "I heard this PK was proposed by Brother Dong. What did you think at the time, Sister Xiao?"
 

 
"I was quite surprised because I wasn’t very familiar with him at that time; we’d only exchanged greetings once or twice. But later, during the roadshow, we got to know each other better, and looking back now, it wasn’t surprising that he wanted to challenge me."
 

 
"Haha, speaking of the roadshow, you still didn’t get to have hotpot."
 

 
"Yeah, but when we went to Guangzhou, I brought him back some dim sum."
 

 
"As for how I felt about the challenge..."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment.
 

 
The camera zoomed in on her face, capturing a close-up of the mischievous smile in her slightly narrowed eyes: "In the first half, I was testing him. In the second half, it seemed like I hadn’t even started trying before he went down. Nothing special! It was pretty much the same as what we do in the movies."
 

 
[“I hadn’t even tried yet, how did you fall down?”]
 

 
[Who’s pretending? Oh, it’s Tong Zhao. Never mind then.]
 

 
[Sister Zhao is amazing 66666.]
 

 
[What does ‘pretty much the same as the movie’ mean? I really want to see the new drama now!]
 

 
Considering the limited conditions in real life, the match was already this exciting—how fierce would she be in the ‘Instinct’ movie?
 

 
This was the thought of most of the audience at that moment.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff worked efficiently, editing the ten-round showdown into a short video, which was promptly posted on Weibo. Related marketing accounts were also quickly set up to help with promotions, creating a wave of strategic marketing…
 

 
Seeing Brother Dong get beaten up, the onlookers couldn’t stop laughing.
 

 
Brother Dong was quite well-liked by the public, though he often came up with weird, out-of-the-box ideas.
 

 
If it had been a regular, normal male celebrity, netizens would have probably imagined that he was under some unspoken pressure, forced to perform this scene where he gets beaten by Tong Zhao, and some fans would inevitably feel sorry for him and complain…
 

 
But this was Brother Dong!
 

 
He himself said he was super happy to get beaten.
 

 
Not only that, he didn’t just want one round of getting hit; he wanted an unlimited refill…
 

 
So the public, with no psychological burden, happily shared and joked about it without any guilt.
 

 
The creativity of netizens is boundless, and one of the posts that garnered over six thousand shares was a meme.
 

 
The first one showed Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in the ring, with no expression.
 

 
The caption: "I can’t win."
 

 
The second one was even better—Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in a six-panel grid.
 

 
The caption: "I’m pretending."
 

 
The contrast was too funny, and it was clear that Tong Zhao was bringing something new to the table.
 

 
Due to the pre-and post-match promotional clips where Brother Dong repeatedly mentioned wanting to keep fighting, those who didn’t know the full story might have thought he had heroically beaten his opponent and was eager to continue torturing her. But it turns out he was the one who got beaten up? How surreal! Fans covered their faces, unable to watch any longer, and onlookers wondered if the livestream was still going. Was there more to see?
 

 
While watching the livestream and scrolling through Weibo, the audience's spirits lifted. They quickly shared the link.
 

 
The number of viewers in the livestream surged.
 

 
New viewers saw that the match had ended, but the original viewers weren’t satisfied yet. They shouted in the bullet screen, wanting more. After some quick calculations, the marketing team remembered Brother Dong’s traditional skill—singing. Brother Dong, wiping sweat with a wet towel, turned to the staff and asked, "If the time is running short, I can keep fighting with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Staff: "…"
 

 
The reactions from both the bullet screen and the staff were exactly the same.
 

 
Staff: "The fans want to hear you sing. Besides, Tong Zhao just fought with you and is exhausted."
 

 
In the boxing gym, there were some simple fitness equipment.
 

 
After hearing the staff, Brother Dong turned his gaze toward Tong Zhao. She was using the equipment for pull-ups, her arms and back engaging as she effortlessly pulled herself up. Those around her watched in awe, unable to believe how someone with her muscle mass could have such hardcore strength. While not quite at the level of "superhuman strength," her movements were incredibly light, as if the exercises were effortless for her.
 

 
But… "Exhausted?" Who are you kidding? Maybe you could fool a three-year-old.
 

 
The staff, caught in Brother Dong’s silent gaze, was speechless. He couldn’t blame Tong Zhao for not cooperating, as she didn’t know he was using her to convince Brother Dong. The staff was still trying to come up with a new excuse when Brother Dong smiled, curling his thin lips, and looked at the staff with an expression as if he had seen through their little scheme, yet still showing a tolerant smile. "I can sing."
 

 
His smile was warm.
 

 
Having just been outsmarted by Brother Dong, the staff was left with complicated feelings, turning them into four simple words: "Thank you, Brother Dong."
 

 
Fans in the livestream were excited to hear that Brother Dong would sing.
 

 
Some of the onlookers were about to leave.
 

 
But a portion of them knew that Brother Dong could sing well and wanted to hear him live—
 

 
Several of Brother Dong's songs had gone viral on Douyin, including "Sensual Lover" and "Stop Desire." Clicking on those songs, one could find hundreds of unique short videos showcasing abs and perfect timing with the music.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished letting Brother Dong win, she left the remaining time to herself.
 

 
The host asked Tong Zhao if she had ever heard Brother Dong sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and smiled, complimenting him: "It’s hard not to have heard of him!"
 

 
[Emotional Intelligence]
 

 
[Thank you, Sister Xiao, for praising our Brother Dong!]
 

 
[Brother Dong’s songs are good, but 'Stop Desire' is really too catchy. Every time I hear that BGM, I feel like a muscular man is about to jump out and pull up his shirt with a small whip.]
 

 
Brother Dong tilted his head: "Many people discovered my brainwashing songs through public loudspeakers on the subway and buses. Were you one of the victims?"
 

 
The air was still for a few seconds.
 

 
[Business Intelligence]
 

 
[The 'Emotional Intelligence' was written backwards, LOL.]
 

 
[So Brother Dong knows his songs are brainwashing!]
 

 
…
 

 
In the end, the livestream turned into a duet on the stage with the two of them singing a love song.
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao didn’t let another persona take over.
 

 
If the character "Consort Chen," who was best at singing, had taken over, the audience’s mood would have shifted. Tong Zhao’s singing skills weren’t bad; with more experience, her emotions were richer, bridging the gap with Brother Dong. Their two voices, which leaned toward a mature and sensual tone, perfectly expressed the emotions of "Stop Desire," even making them briefly forget that they were on a boxing ring, not a stage...
 

 
The audience was thrilled and said this time, they were truly hooked.
 

 
The promotional event came to a successful close.
 

 
Only Brother Dong, still upset, shot Tong Zhao one last glance after the livestream ended: "No next time?”
 

 
"No next time, I'm a female celebrity, not a fighter."
 

 
With one sentence, Tong Zhao shut down all of Brother Dong's thoughts.
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Being looked at with intense, affectionate eyes by a handsome guy, while he says he wants to "come again"—that experience was kind of new and intriguing. But if that "coming again" didn’t involve another fight, it would have been perfect. Just as the staff were organizing to go out for hotpot, Brother Dong missed his chance to talk to her again. The streetlight cast a warm, yellowish glow on his face, and his wet, shimmering eyes were filled with unspoken melancholy.
 

 
The moment their gazes met, Tong Zhao began to feel like the entertainment industry was a place where only the truly crazy survived.
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think we're still quite normal."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I should be the most abnormal one."
 

 
Han Zhi: "And the cutest one."
 

 
Other personalities agreed.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment and added a note: "That must also make me the most narcissistic."
 

 
...
 

 
Once the live broadcast and the subsequent data flow were out, Tang Yanhao, who played the male lead’s boyfriend Cheng Siwen in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, sent her a message.
 

 
Tang Yanhao: "Sis, I also want to get beaten up / crying/crying."
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. Could this be some kind of contagious mental state?
 

 
As Tang Yanhao explained, since the PK live broadcast, the audience had started to link Tong Zhao and Brother Dong together in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, creating a mutually beneficial bond between them. Meanwhile, his character—the real "CP" in the film—was completely forgotten, and Tang Yanhao was so bitter that he planted a whole room full of lemon trees.
 

 
He wasn’t mad at Tong Zhao, but he was furious with Brother Dong.
 

 
How could that guy come up with such a publicity stunt?
 

 
But getting angry at Brother Dong was the most pointless thing in the world.
 

 
After thinking it over, Tang Yanhao’s lemon-juice-soaked brain came up with a dim-witted idea—
 

 
Since Brother Dong’s beating became a trending topic, why not replicate that classic stunt?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…There’s really no need."
 

 
Tang Yanhao calmed down and thought it through.
 

 
The first person to take on the stunt is the one who creates the buzz, but the second one? It just seems like too much of a marketing gimmick.
 

 
Moreover, his image was different from Brother Dong's.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted him: "The box office of the movie will benefit you too, plus you have more screen time."
 

 
Tang Yanhao wasn't very familiar with her and wasn’t at her level in the industry. He was a bit flattered by her comforting words and thanked her for her kindness, saying he would look forward to the box office.
 

 
But then, he added:
 

 
"Next time there’s an opportunity to get beaten up like this, be sure to call me!”
# Chapter99
Tang Yanhao wasn’t about to give up.
 

 
He was convinced that Tong Zhao was like a good-luck charm that naturally attracted attention, and he secretly hoped to soak up some of her spotlight.
 

 
How did he go about it?
 

 
Whenever Jiang Dang praised Tong Zhao, he would follow suit.
 

 
“Recently, Tong Zhao has pretty much become the center of attention. When people mention ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, they almost think of her by default. As a co-star in this film, what’s your take on her?”
 

 
Ever since Tong Zhao’s rise to fame, questions like these—intended to stir up conflict—had frequently been asked to other actors in the film. Jiang Dang usually acted a bit clueless with unexpected questions (because his manager, fearing he might go off-script, would pre-write responses and send them to him over WeChat to memorize). But when it came to this question, he became surprisingly chatty, praising Tong Zhao extensively.
 

 
And yet, not even his most jealous fans felt insecure about his admiration for her.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had put it like this:
 

 
“I really admire her. There’s probably a misunderstanding with the public—somehow, the only roles I get offered are villains, the kind that the protagonist is supposed to be terrified of. But I’m actually such a gentle, friendly person, you know? It’s strange; being on a movie set and actually feeling fear was a first for me. Tong Zhao gave me this brand-new experience. When she looked at me on set, I felt like she genuinely wanted to kill me. It was exhilarating—I’d love to experience that in real life a few more times… but…”
 

 
But?
 

 
Sensing a juicy twist, the journalist’s interest was instantly piqued, hoping to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao from her fellow cast members.
 

 
Journalist: “But what?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was tinged with a sense of wistful longing, almost as if he was caught in unrequited admiration. “In real life, there’s too big a gap in our abilities. She’s way too skilled, always in complete control, and I never felt the threat of actually being ‘killed.’”
 

 
“…?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a subtle smile. “Still, there’s something interesting about that feeling of being toyed with. Gains and losses, I guess. Not something you get to experience every day.”
 

 
The reporter felt like a complete fool for thinking just a moment ago that they could extract any useful news from Jiang Dang's mouth.
 

 
This interview was so entertaining. The sense of connection between the two in the movie was even stronger, and Tang Yanhao was incredibly envious. He also wanted some of the spotlight. "I think this is pretty unfair."
 

 
Since his debut, Tang Yanhao had always maintained the image of a sunny, boy-next-door type. He spoke normally, with a bit of shy freshness, which entertainment reporters liked. Several reporters, hearing him mention "unfair" — a keyword that could stir up drama — immediately rushed to his side.
 

 
"Can you elaborate on what's unfair?"
 

 
"Is it bullying on set?"
 

 
"Did they get physical with you?"
 

 
It was getting a little out of hand.
 

 
With a look that clearly said, "What are you talking about, nonsense?" Tang Yanhao looked at the reporters and said:
 

 
"I think it's unfair that they didn't let me join in on the fighting competition. I want to play too."
 

 
"Bullying on set? What nonsense, Xiao Zhao treats me really well."
 

 
"Want me to complain about her? Fine, looks like I won't get out of here until I say something..."
 

 
Tang Yanhao thought for a moment, then came up with a set of words full of grievances: "She only fights Jiang Dang, never me. It's so biased. I’m clearly the top CP in her movie!" He almost slipped and said "crab legs CP," but thankfully stopped himself in time.
 

 
---
 

 
The entertainment reporters were beginning to feel that the actors from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ seemed a little off.
 

 
This interview allowed Tang Yanhao to gain a bit of the spotlight's fringe heat, and netizens jokingly called him the "most insignificant male lead" and urged him to hand over his secondary Weibo account – listening to him describe his "top CP" in such dramatic terms, he must have been shipping fanfiction couples all along!
 

 
However, this remains an unsolved mystery.
 

 
After all the questions, the reporter was unable to uncover any negative opinions about Tong Zhao within the crew, so they could only leave in frustration.
 

 
The girl's reputation among her colleagues was extraordinarily good.
 

 
When a few whispers did emerge, it was usually about how she didn’t engage much with others during breaks, often wearing an eye mask and pretending to sleep. However, other staff members would say, "What are you listening to? Tong Zhao is actually really nice. It's just that at first, when people tried to ask her which stock to buy for sure profits, she didn’t want to talk. Maybe that’s why some people held a grudge against her."
 

 
The reporter then remembered she also had the nickname of an investment genius.
 

 
The industry forecasted good box office numbers for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. Fans of action movies would definitely be satisfied, and the light, fun storyline was suitable for all ages. With director Shi’s and Director Deng’s subtle additions of personal touches, it also had some deeper layers, along with funny and contrasting moments to entertain the younger crowd…
 

 
However, the final box office of a movie is not always entirely determined by its quality.
 

 
Sometimes, it’s almost a mystical thing.
 

 
Most of the time, the reasons can only be inferred from the final box office results.
 

 
So, what would the box office trajectory of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ look like?
 

 
…
 

 
On the day of its release, the top trending spot was occupied by ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
At first, this was probably due to its massive hype.
 

 
However, once it reached the top, it never dropped. The gap between it and the second-place romantic comedy had already widened by over three million, making the competition jealous. Within just half a day of its release, its box office was already heading straight for eight figures – who could handle this?
 

 
Real-time projections kept rising.
 

 
Both online and offline cinemas were filled with people chasing the trend.
 

 
There were no scheduling factors online, but the issue was the promotion slots – cinemas with higher box office numbers would receive more promotional boosts, which in turn sold more tickets.
 

 
What made this film so good? Critics were puzzled.
 

 
If we talk about quality, of course, it wasn’t lacking.
 

 
But before its release, many thought it might become Director Shi’s Waterloo because modern martial arts movies were quite rare, and Tong Zhao’s concept of "two subconsciouses" sounded like a marketing gimmick…
 

 
From a god’s-eye view of the cinemas and the real audience reviews, a hint of its appeal could be seen.
 

 
The cinemas were filled with constant laughter, and viewers were even mimicking martial arts moves in the hallways after the movie…
 

 
[The immersion is so great, I suspect the screenwriter is a wuxia author.]
 

 
[Is this a super high-class movie? No, it’s not. It’s something really special, and after watching it, you’ll want to see it again.]
 

 
[I think ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is way more artistic.]
 

 
[The biggest similarity between ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is that they both look so satisfying. My six-year-old son is already calling for martial arts classes, but it doesn’t count toward school credits. It’s frustrating. I suggest parents secretly watch it without bringing their kids.]
 

 
In the data stream, the word "satisfying" appeared twice as often as "good."
 

 
The data doesn’t lie; it faithfully reflected the audience's feelings after watching the movie.
 

 
A movie that has depth, humor, and handsome men and beautiful women – a feel-good film whose box office far surpasses the tear-jerking tragic films. Indeed, a thought-provoking good movie can inspire the audience to think, spark discussions, and bring more new viewers into the theater. However, most people don’t want to cry twice for the same movie in the theater. Once you’ve seen a scene, it’s not as emotional the second time around.
 

 
Some of the lines written by Director Deng personally added depth to the film.
 

 
The movie's exploration of martial arts traditions came from the off-screen guidance of Director Deng from the Jingwu Martial Arts School.
 

 
The new era's interpretation of martial arts traditions, on the other hand, came from Tong Zhao’s subconscious improvisation.
 

 
Some audience members especially liked the intellectual clash between the protagonist, Xie Guiye, and the villain —
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was very angry, believing that the current era had forgotten the inheritance of Chinese martial arts, and that all the heroes had been abandoned by time.
 

 
Everyone, including the audience, thought that the protagonist, who had always shown a dislike for martial arts, would follow along and denounce traditional martial arts, but unexpectedly, Tong Zhao shook her head and replied, “What is martial arts? Swords, spears, halberds, axes, hooks, chains, whips, hammers, claws, sticks, staffs, and the meteor hammer – swordplay, sword techniques, knife techniques, and lightness skills. Being a hero is about eradicating evil and promoting good for the nation, not just learning some half-baked martial arts and cosplaying.”
 

 
Bullet comments:
 

 
[Xie Guiye hates martial arts, but can recite all 18 weapons. Brilliant!]
 

 
[This movie could also be called ‘Corporate Drones vs. Chuunibyou’]
 

 
Some sharp-eyed viewers noticed the subconscious shift in Tong Zhao’s character midway through and commented: [Early Xie Guiye: I’ll just criticize everything! Later Xie Guiye: I’ll just fight!]
 

 
…
 

 
@Instinct Film Scene: This entire March, a martial arts movie is dominating the screens! / Laughing and crying
 

 
It truly dominated the screens, with everyone talking about this movie.
 

 
Putting aside the continuous box office breakthroughs, the entire crew of the movie spent the entire month going to bed with smiles on their faces. While some discussed the box office, what really fascinated netizens were the various fan-made videos mimicking the main characters…
 

 
The leader of this trend was a Bilibili content creator named Shen Huo, who was said to be a male fan of Jiang Dang, with some rather unique ideas.
 

 
After ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was released, Shen Huo organized an event to meet the top-ranked fan offline, including round-trip airfare. The number one fan turned out to be a female netizen, and his fans were immediately shocked and couldn't believe it. They were amazed, "Does Shen Huo really have female fans?" and began imagining a love story between the male broadcaster and the wealthy female fan.
 

 
The female fan really showed up.
 

 
So what was the mystery activity for the meetup?
 

 
It was an imitation of the classic battle moves between the protagonists, Xie Guiye and Fu Xuancheng.

On the left, you have the original movie, with handsome men and beautiful women looking heroic.
 

 
On the right, you have an unenthused rich girl and a male host beaming with joy.
 

 
The amateur performers, with no martial arts background, had soft and weak moves, which was unintentionally hilarious.
 

 
[Don’t use the original movie to fool us!]
 

 
[Jiang Dang’s fans are terrifying in another sense…]
 

 
[Since you’re here, let me recommend our Shen Huo! Click on the creator’s album and check out the original songs!]
 

 
Well, this person is both messing around and singing.
 

 
After this meme spread widely, TikTok followed suit, with the most popular soundbite being "Master, this is a master!" The brainwashing voiceover became an almost spiritual pollution. If you hear it on a bus or subway and glance at someone’s phone screen, you’re almost certain to see scenes from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
Some core audiences thought this wave was very tacky, but it genuinely sparked more curiosity and led to more ticket sales...
 

 
With these spin-off memes so popular and the movie still in theaters, many decided to go watch it.
 

 
…
 

 
This expanded audience base later led to some hindsight criticism from certain movie critics…
 

 
"Analyzing Tong Zhao's Subconscious Success in Wealth Codes: A Walking Feel-Good Film Factory"
 

 
This review, shared over six thousand times, comes from a movie critic with millions of followers.
 

 
He summarized all of Tong Zhao’s movies, pulling out scenes from each one, and discovered that no matter how the script was written, her subconscious always turned the movie into a feel-good narrative. This is why the audience never gets tired of watching her—she has the same kind of comeback story as Cinderella, a timeless theme in storytelling.
 

 
The review hit the nail on the head regarding Tong Zhao's career and her fan base.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at it and felt that, to some extent, this person was right. The quick-paced, mission-completing characters she portrayed were indeed in line with the feel-good narrative style.
 

 
Along with the surge in box office and reputation, her market value skyrocketed.
 

 
The industry wondered, ‘Can she rise even more?’
 

 
During the time of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, her price was already sky-high, and she had decided to focus more on reducing her production and choosing higher-tier projects, unwilling to accept scripts she wasn’t interested in.
 

 
So, what kind of scripts does this box office queen like?
 

 
Inside Tong Zhao’s mind palace, a little one sat in the middle of the older siblings, feeling troubled in front of a pile of scripts.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why not just forget it?”
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Zhao Zai protested loudly, then mumbled softly:
 

 
“Only you guys get to play… I also want to contribute something to my sister!”
 

 
Consort Chen glanced at her: “You staying put is your biggest contribution.”
 

 
The little one was struck down by this precise hit, her eyes brimming with tears. She was comforted in the arms of Elder Lu. Zhao Zai shook her head and clenched her small fist: “It’s okay, I will definitely pick the right script.”
# Chapter100
Due to certain radical tendencies, the success rate of completed missions had significantly dropped.
 

 
Thus, with her consent, the persona of “Xiao Zhao” was created.
 

 
Xiao Zhao was somewhat unique. She retained faint memories of the first three world-hopping missions, but everything was filtered through a thick layer of innocence. She remembered once captivating an entire kingdom with a smile, leading a group of loyal comrades to survive the apocalypse, and even being a top-tier heartthrob adored by countless fans...
 

 
But what did that have to do with a little elementary school girl who loved drinking milk and eating lollipops?
 

 
Xiao Zhao was puzzled.
 

 
However, her predecessors’ experiences weren’t useless.
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s mission was to reduce the blackening risk of three major villains.
 

 
These three villains couldn’t simply be reformed with love and kindness.
 

 
The first villain was destined to be a cold, future scientific mastermind with a nearly superhuman intellect. He saw even adults as intellectually inferior, almost a different species entirely. Compassion from someone so “primitive” meant nothing to him. Xiao Zhao thought it over and decided to try the nurturing approach based on her older sister, Consort Chen’s, experience.
 

 
Despite his extraordinary intellect, the young genius’s sense of beauty hadn’t mutated.
 

 
Like other boys his age, he still recognized beauty and was quite mature for his age.
 

 
And so... the little genius fell.
 

 
But Xiao Zhao, tasked with an important mission, couldn’t linger on one villain. Just as he gathered the courage to confess his early feelings, she politely declined, telling him that she not only admired boys who excel academically but especially those who aspired to contribute to the country as great scholars.
 

 
The young genius:?
 

 
Eventually, the young genius was reformed, becoming a leading scientist who contributed positively to society.
 

 
#The Daily Life of a Stoic Scientist with a Romantic Heart#
 

 
The second villain was set on a path of revenge, distorted by a mix of cowardice and inferiority. He was a troubled child, born to a gambling-addicted father and a mother who silently endured domestic abuse. One day, his usually gentle mother unexpectedly beat him harshly over a trivial matter, chasing him out of the house. Frightened, he wandered outside until late, finally returning to find his mother hanging lifeless and his father poisoned.
 

 
The truth was that his debt-ridden father, desperate to pay a 500,000 yuan loan shark debt, had decided to kill his family for the insurance money. Having been abused and stripped of any will to resist, his mother saw no other way to protect her son than this tragic choice.
 

 
From that day on, the boy’s capacity for genuine emotional connection was broken.
 

 
Whenever others showed him kindness, it only made him anxious; only money gave him comfort. He always remembered the debt his father tried to repay that night, and later on, he became infamous for elaborate financial scams, amassing a fortune.
 

 
Xiao Zhao took a different approach to intervene. She gently nudged his mother, suggesting there were other ways than total destruction. She encouraged her to report the abuse to the authorities, to reach out to family services, and to establish connections with neighbors, creating a support network.
 

 
Villain: “All my suffering is because of poverty.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “You’re absolutely right! Here’s a profitable path for you—given your intellect, it’s a sure thing!”
 

 
Villain:?
 

 
Thanks to this intervention, he switched to a wealth-building path, investing in stocks and achieving success legitimately.
 

 
The third villain was a beautiful girl born into a family with a strong preference for sons. Growing up in a toxic environment, she later became an accomplice in perpetuating the same harm she experienced. Her parents, captivated by her looks, pushed her into modeling as a child star, and as she entered the entertainment industry, she became highly successful but quickly descended into moral decay. She began recruiting other young women to exploit for wealthy clients, forgetting her original love for acting and her dream of being admired by all.
 

 
Xiao Zhao extended a hand of friendship to this “little sister.”
 

 
Under her family’s influence, the girl had low self-esteem. Despite Xiao Zhao’s encouragement, she struggled to feel pride in herself, facing the choice of either sinking further into harm or becoming a target for manipulation.
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Do you really need to rely on others to feel valued?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Well, in that case, how about liking me instead?”
 

 
By becoming Xiao Zhao’s loyal “fan,” she found her self-worth.
 

 
Marriage for family honor? She only wanted to stay close to Xiao Zhao, so there was no need for that.
 

 
Buying a house for her brother? Maybe save for a castle for Xiao Zhao instead!
 

 
Xiao Zhao fulfilled her mission in this childlike seven-year-old “quick transmigration” world, reforming all three villains before their darker tendencies took root. Sadly, she couldn’t stay long enough to live a full life there, as the system transferred her to the next world before she could grow up—or date any of them!
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen prodded her soft, chubby cheek: “You look as intense as someone hustling for a phone screen protector under the bridge.”
 

 
Another poke.
 

 
The soft cheek dented slightly, and Consort Chen couldn’t resist poking again.
 

 
Finally, one poke too many, and Xiao Zhao snapped around, biting the tip of her finger.
 

 
It was the ultimate “look up and bite”!
 

 
Consort Chen: “...Let go.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao, mumbling with her mouth full: “Only if you stop poking my face.”
 

 
“Fine, fine, no more poking.”
 

 
Consort Chen reluctantly withdrew her hand, then elegantly wiped her fingertip on a silk handkerchief, brushing off imaginary saliva.
 

 
The scripts coming in for Tong Zhao were more varied than ever before.
 

 
In the past, most scripts were designed specifically for characters like Consort Chen and Duan Ge, with a few mixed in as attempts to get her to try unconventional roles as male protagonists. However, such bold requests were rare, and they were always small productions. Even if she was interested, the company could block her… Up until now, she’d been respectful of her manager’s opinions, and Han Zhi never pushed her to take on male roles.
 

 
Sometimes, he’d casually stream, chat with fans, and play games, practically becoming an ASMR streamer.
 

 
In short, no one was offering her child roles. Just as in traditional films, child characters in Instinct Films would still be played by real children. Since adults entering a child-modeled body carried an inherent discordance, it posed a high risk of incompatibility. Plus, there were plenty of kids willing to take on those roles.
 

 
As Zhao flipped through the scripts, her mood sank lower.
 

 
Just then, her phone rang, forcing her to pause and answer her agent’s call.
 

 
In her subconscious palace, Zhao lay like a defeated lump of rice cake in Lu Xianzhang’s embrace, her dreams crushed.
 

 
After explaining her new schedule, Sister Chu asked, “What are you up to? It’s awfully quiet.”
 

 
“Just reading through the scripts you sent me.”
 

 
Sister Chu wasn’t surprised; in fact, she was pleased with this response. Among her clients, Tong Zhao was by far the most hardworking.
 

 
“No rush. Or maybe look at some variety shows, if any interest you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked if she had any recommendations.
 

 
Sister Chu laughed and replied, “If I were to suggest something, take it with a grain of salt; your preferences are what matter. Based on your past films, the male leads have had low presence. Even when you’ve had love interests, they’ve ended up overshadowed by you. Like in ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where the male character was strong enough to hold his own, but only as a villain, not as a love interest. And in The Knives of the Maiden’, viewers felt Cheng Siwen wasn’t worthy of you—the main character is meant to shine alone.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s subconscious is more dominant than that of many famously strong male stars. It’s rare in East Asian culture, where female stars’ subconscious in Instinct Films often gravitates toward “completion” through marriage and children—a reflection of cultural influence.
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t have those thoughts, probably due to her strong sense of individuality formed during her transmigrations.
 

 
“There are critics who say your subconscious is too domineering; everyone’s eager to see you fall in love on screen.”
 

 
After sharing her thoughts, Chu quickly emphasized that she wasn’t pressuring Tong Zhao to take a romance-focused role. Tong Zhao was curious—she’d always known her company and manager respected her choices, so why the need for extra reassurance?
 

 
Sister Chu clarified:
 

 
“The industry now trusts your godly script-picking eye. The way every film you choose becomes a hit isn’t something analysis can explain—it has to be some kind of magic. I can’t mess with that magic!”
 

 
…
 

 
Magic, my foot!
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Superstitious nonsense.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Someone saw you meditating at the gym during the last roadshow.”
 

 
…
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: [The feng shui in that spot is great.]
 

 
"Alright, then let’s try some magic."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled. After hanging up the phone, she playfully imagined herself as others saw her: she tossed all the scripts into the air, waiting for them to fall, then picked up the one closest to her.
 

 
"Neverland Girl (Working Title)"
 

 
It was, surprisingly, a romance movie.
 

 
"Neverland..."
 

 
The term “Neverland” originates from the 1904 story ‘Peter Pan’, a tale known worldwide. The protagonist, Peter Pan, is a boy who doesn’t want to grow up—and never will. The story revolves around him and a little fairy. According to urban legend, the original version wasn’t so cheerful. When the boys on Neverland began to grow up, they were killed by Peter Pan for the “crime” of betraying the island by maturing. [Note]
 

 
However, the truth of that version remains unclear.
 

 
The most official final version is a much happier one, where children spend a blissful time on Neverland but ultimately choose to return home to face life’s responsibilities. In reality, no one can avoid growing up—except Peter Pan, a fictional character. Neverland serves as a place within a fairytale that embodies the author’s nostalgia and sense of loss.
 

 
But this film clearly chose the darker version.
 

 
The female lead is a second child, born after her elderly parents lost their first daughter and did everything in their power to have another child. After the tragic loss of their eldest, her parents’ mental states were shaken, and the main character grew up drenched in their overprotective love. Shielded from the outside world in their countryside mansion, she barely saw anyone else, and her parents were happy to see their little princess safe under their watchful eyes.
 

 
One day, she accidentally fell into a pond and, after being rescued, lost her memory.
 

 
She transformed into a child trapped within an adult’s body.
 

 
Her elderly parents were devastated, both by their inability to ignore their daughter’s condition and by their declining health, which made it impossible to keep her all to themselves. They spared no expense in hiring a doctor to treat her, and the story unfolds between doctor and patient, with the girl falling in love with him…
 

 
That’s the main storyline.
 

 
On the hidden side, the script reveals that before losing her memory, the female lead had somehow managed to acquire an unmonitored phone. Through it, she began to sense that her life wasn’t quite normal. Yet, understanding her parents’ grief and deep love for her, she chose to endure it.
 

 
But, as they say, using the internet without falling in love is a waste of bandwidth…
 

 
Through the phone, she fell in love.
 

 
Love became a trigger for her free will to awaken. After testing her parents’ reactions, she felt hopeless, believing her desire to leave home was a betrayal. But unable to ignore her yearning for freedom, she ultimately decided to drown herself in the pond.
 

 
That incident wasn’t an accident at all.
 

 
And the doctor wasn’t a real doctor, either.
 

 
He was actually a top-notch con artist who’d dropped out of high school—and also her online boyfriend.
 

 
If her parents had hired someone through normal means, they might have gotten a real doctor. But their exhaustive hiring process played perfectly into the hands of this seasoned con man.
 

 
The male lead, who refused to grow up and shunned responsibility, crosses paths with the female lead, who was forced to stay a child. In the secluded mansion, the two rekindle a strange connection and explore the meaning of growing up.
 

 
…
 

 
After finishing the script, Tong Zhao had only one thought:
 

 
“Maybe I really do have magical powers.”
# Chapter101
Tong Zhao sent the ‘Neverland Girl’ script to her agent.
 

 
She didn’t even glance at the crew members already attached to the project. After all, Sister Chu had previously told her that as long as she chose scripts she liked, everything else would fall into place. Any movie with her name attached would easily attract investors; many people wanted to work with her. That said, prominent male stars were often hesitant to collaborate with her—industry gossip claimed that working alongside her was never a win-win for male actors, and they merely ended up supporting her. Actresses, on the other hand, might have a chance to create an intriguing sisterly bond with her on screen.
 

 
There were even rumors that Tong Zhao was a lesbian.
 

 
She couldn’t care less about these tabloid rumors. Those sensational gossip columns, lacking any hard evidence, were filled with outrageous claims about her. According to their stories, she was attending eight social dinners a week, rumored to be involved with nine other entertainers—three of whom were allegedly women. They claimed the entire Zeshan crew was her “harem” and that she was so distraught by her fame she was contemplating suicide daily.
 

 
Without proof, none of it held much weight.
 

 
A luxury cast? No worries. With "Tong Zhao" on the bill, her name alone equaled a top-tier production.
 

 
She had already mentally prepared herself for the possibility of liking the script but ending up with a subpar production team. However, as soon as she sent the script to Sister Chu, she received a quick reply—six ellipses.
 

 
Puzzled, Tong Zhao asked and discovered the situation was worse than expected.
 

 
Unbelievable! Aside from the script, there was only a producer.
 

 
The producer was very young, with only one previous project to his name, which had completely flopped. As a result, he couldn’t even attract a director this time. How the project had gotten this far was anyone’s guess. After some thought, Sister Chu recalled, “I remember thinking the script was good at the time; I figured you might like it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “I do like it.”
 

 
“But,” she added, “no investment, no director, and no cast? Even though the script is great, it’s a bit beneath my standing.”
 

 
She had to consider the entire team.
 

 
Sister Chu assumed she was ready to drop the project, but Tong Zhao continued, “Give me the producer’s contact information. I’ll invest in this film myself.”
 

 
Sister Chu was stunned. “What are you planning to do now?”
 

 
“These instinct-driven films burn through money fast,” she warned. “Going up even a little in quality can easily cost the price of multiple homes… Besides, if you just express interest in taking the role, finding investors shouldn’t be an issue.”
 

 
Initially, Tong Zhao had just spoken on impulse.
 

 
This was the kind of script perfect for Zhao Zai. Not only did she want to act in it, but she wanted it to be made into a truly great film.
 

 
Who doesn’t dream of traveling back in time to give their younger self the care they deserve?
 

 
Righting past regrets, having that toy they never got, or fulfilling a dream—this was a chance for her adult self to become her childhood hero.
 

 
"Found anyone?"
 

 
"Don’t even mention a director—we can’t even find supporting actors. Whenever people hear the name Xu Yiming, they just want to run."
 

 
In China, the concept of a producer differs a bit from Hollywood. Often, directors end up handling producer tasks, but Xu Yiming is more of a traditional producer, frequently joking about being the "film industry foreman." He had reached out to countless people, casting a wide net out of sheer determination. He had held on this long because he genuinely believed in the ‘Neverland Girl’ script and desperately wanted to see it made into a film and then watch the finished product in theaters, knowing he had been the one to piece it together.
 

 
At a street stall, empty beer cans littered the ground beneath their table.
 

 
Xu Yiming had a strong tolerance for alcohol. Even after downing a case of beer with friends, he was still speaking in flawless Mandarin, though a hint of melancholy crept into his words. “I just don’t want this good script to gather dust. But if no one’s willing to shoot it, what can I do? I used up all my connections with ‘Blood Battle’, and now even my reputation won’t get me anywhere…”
 

 
“To be honest, if selling myself would help, I’d be willing to do it.”
 

 
His drinking buddy shook his head, joking, “Three cents won’t get you far.”
 

 
Hearing that his looks were only worth three cents made Xu Yiming even more dejected.
 

 
His friend cracked open a bottle of baijiu and poured a shot, saying, “Stop thinking about useless things. Just drink.”
 

 
Just as Xu Yiming was about to take the glass, his phone chimed.
 

 
“Got a message from the work group chat—let me check it first,” he said.
 

 
When Xu Yiming looked at his phone, he didn’t expect much. He figured it was just another polite rejection—someone else saying their schedule was full, or they didn’t feel capable of doing justice to the script. In reality, they just didn’t want to take on a project without a clear profit potential. Xu didn’t blame them; he blamed himself for being unable to pull things together.
 

 
But as he looked down at his phone, he froze.
 

 
He reread the message several times, sobering up in the process.
 

 
His drinking buddy, noticing how Xu kept staring at his phone and muttering, "This can’t be real…" was curious. "What’s going on? A few beers and you can’t even read Chinese?"
 

 
Xu Yiming flipped his phone around and showed him the message.
 

 
His friend was stunned.
 

 
"Wait, this Tong Zhao—is this ‘the’ Tong Zhao? Holy…!"
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s name left him momentarily speechless, in complete shock.
 

 
"Yeah, it’s her." Xu Yiming, seeing his friend more shocked than he was, actually felt a bit calmer. But he was still confused—he knew of Manager Chu, a well-known agent. By some miracle, one of her artists could take an interest in his project, but Tong Zhao? She was the kind of star directors would scramble to please. How did he get so lucky?
 

 
Not only did he get her interest, but she even mentioned investing.
 

 
What on earth was going on?
 

 
This felt like a gift from the heavens, with a golden ingot tucked inside.
 

 
A cold breeze swept through the street stall, but Xu Yiming’s face was flushed with excitement. He quickly typed up a reply, while his friend didn’t mind being ignored. Instead, he sat next to Xu, watching him negotiate and marveling, "Man, if Tong Zhao’s interested in your project, you must have just used up a lifetime of good luck. When we order a designated driver later, let’s not share a car. I’m worried you might get in an accident."
 

 
"Screw you!"
 

 
…
 

 
Despite his harsh words, Xu Yiming’s heart was racing. After getting Tong Zhao’s contact info and discussing her thoughts on the project, he decided to spend the night at a nearby budget hotel instead of going home.
 

 
Tong Zhao liked his project.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to invest.
 

 
Tong Zhao even offered to post in her social circle to see if she could find suitable collaborators?
 

 
This level of luck—he genuinely feared he’d be crushed by a falling sign if he drove home.
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao reviewed her finances; funding a low-budget romance film wouldn’t be a problem. But she wasn’t in a rush and told Xu Yiming to wait a bit.
 

 
Wait for what?
 

 
Wait for the final box office results of ‘The Knives of the Maiden.’
 

 
This well-crafted movie was also superbly marketed, with industry experts saying that Zhao’s self-made buzz had boosted it from a solid 7/10 to an 8.5 box office success. Some in the industry dismissed analytical explanations entirely, attributing it to sheer "Zhao magic."
 

 
But it wasn’t magic.
 

 
Audience appeal is a mysterious thing, and after her roles in ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘Heartless Tribulation,’ the name Tong Zhao now stood for one thing in people’s minds—her films wouldn’t be boring.
 

 
With immersive holographic viewings being the main draw of the box office, people were willing to pay good money to experience something truly unique.
 

 
Tong Zhao had become a guarantee of this unique viewer experience.
 

 
When one film succeeded, every subsequent one seemed destined for success as well. She had become a brand of sorts, an unofficial “logo” that assured audiences. Her peers in the same age range could only watch with envy, frustrated that there was nothing they could do to keep up.
 

 
Male stars initially found it amusing, until they realized that the quarter's top box-office film was once again hers. In her movies, male co-stars frequently got overshadowed, leaving some of them feeling a bit sore about it.
 

 
And ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ delivered an undeniable box-office milestone, reaching an impressive 3 billion under the enthusiastic support of her fans.
 

 
What were her competitors saying? Tong Zhao and her team didn’t care. Anyone could see that her trending keywords on search engines and social media far surpassed those of her peers. The numbers solidified her commercial value; if others once thought her fame depended on the acclaim of director Shi Dingjun, now people simply said that Shi had found the perfect lead.
 

 
Nobody else could have delivered the same impact in those climactic scenes and action sequences as her character, Duan Ge, did.
 

 
With data transparency in the post-immersive-cinema era, the usual tricks fans used to inflate numbers were ineffective. An artist’s commercial worth could now be measured directly through keywords and other data points, using straightforward formulas. It wasn’t magic or hype. Audiences genuinely were drawn to Tong Zhao’s name and willingly bought tickets for her films.
 

 
---
 

 
“I swear, they might as well title the next film ‘Tong Zhao’ already! Every piece of promo material is plastered with her name—did she pay off the whole PR team or what?”
 

 
“It’s impossible to browse online anymore. Open up any social media feed, and it’s all her. Are there seriously no fans getting tired of this?”
 

 
“I’m done. Going to my dance class. For the sake of my sanity, staying off the internet.”
 

 
These complaints echoed quietly among industry insiders.
 

 
One young assistant, trying to show off his inside scoop, whispered, “I heard Tong Zhao’s team plans to cut back her exposure once the movie's run ends. No more variety shows or interviews, maybe…” But he didn’t get to finish before a senior colleague shot him a withering glare.
 

 
They were still competing fiercely for variety show bookings, and he had the nerve to talk about Zhao’s team planning to scale back exposure?
 

 
What kind of movie star “humblebrag” was this?
 

 
Yet, his insider tip was right. Apart from a brief appearance at the celebration event, Tong Zhao withdrew to focus on reading scripts.
 

 
There was a reason ‘Neverland Girl’ had been turned down by so many actresses. The role required the protagonist to convey an intense sense of growing up as she regained her memory. This transformation, easily captured in traditional films, posed a unique challenge in immersive cinema. In other words, the script wasn’t particularly suited for this new format—just something the producer happened to love.
 

 
But as luck would have it, the project struck a personal chord with Tong Zhao.
 

 
She posted to her social circle:
 

 
"Thinking of making a romance film myself. Right now, it’s just me as the lead actress—no director yet."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: “Director reporting in.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Signing up for the male lead.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: “Count me in, I’m interested.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's agent: "No, you don't.”
# Chapter102
The agent really wasn’t thrilled about Song Wanzhuo working with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It wasn’t that he had anything against Tong Zhao—in fact, he, like Wanzhuo, was captivated by her portrayal of the noble concubine, completely spellbound. But from a business perspective, Tong Zhao’s subconscious dominance in sensory films was so overpowering that male roles barely stood a chance. Back in ‘Emperor Ming’, this was less apparent since the emperor’s character retained prominence, but audiences couldn’t help but notice how much they were drawn to her as the noble concubine, despite her limited screen time.
 

 
After that, everyone in the industry knew: she’s an attention magnet. Working with her wouldn’t boost male co-stars’ popularity at all. Jiang Dang, with his unique and intense subconscious presence, had been an exception, but as far as Song Wanzhuo’s agent was concerned, they couldn’t count on that. He knew his client’s strengths; Wanzhuo’s subconscious traits were calm and understated, ideal for serious male-centric roles, but he didn’t have the emotional pull for romance films. Involving him in this genre would be career suicide, so the agent was determined to hold him back.
 

 
The agent privately messaged him: “You haven’t even read the script and you’re saying you want in? Didn’t you just tell me yesterday you were going to be more selective?”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, “Who could resist Tong Zhao’s charm?”
 

 
His agent tried to bring him back to reality: “You can’t be this reckless!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s response was a casual, “I’m just an Easy Boy.”
 

 
The agent, realizing he was out of options, told him, “Fine, go talk to her. But don’t think she’ll necessarily want you, and remember—don’t agree to a low fee, no doing this for free.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo thought his agent was underestimating him. Sure, he liked her performance as the noble concubine, but as long as she didn’t act that irresistibly charming way around him, he’d be fine. He was completely rational about this.
 

 
So, he requested the script.
 

 
Xu Yiming, who had just woken up at the hotel, nearly had a heart attack when he saw Song Wanzhuo’s friend request notification.
 

 
Good thing he didn’t actually have a heart condition.
 

 
Finding out that Song Wanzhuo was considering auditioning for his movie made Xu decide to stay an extra couple of days at the hotel—no way was he risking the walk back!
 

 
---
 

 
From the title alone, ‘Neverland Girl’ suggested that the story’s focus would revolve around the female lead, fitting right in with Tong Zhao’s preference for script selection.
 

 
But upon closer look, the male lead's character was actually crafted with considerable care.
 

 
The male lead is a seasoned con artist, a man who can deceive just about anyone. With his striking appearance, he easily gains others' trust and favor. Using clever language and manipulation, he makes people think he has connections and influence, which leads them to go out of their way to please him. For instance, he once tricked the owner of a struggling luxury hotel into believing he had ties to major corporations and could bring in lucrative business deals.
 

 
The hotel, though in decline, was still fairly upscale, and the owner, desperate to turn things around, showered the male lead with perks—including expensive gifts, a stay in the presidential suite, and a tab for dining and entertainment expenses—all because he thought the lead was networking on his behalf.
 

 
After enjoying the perks, selling off the gifts, and making the most of his stay, the male lead vanished without a trace.
 

 
Since he left no incriminating evidence in their black-and-white chat logs, and the owner had eagerly offered the gifts without hesitation, there was no legal recourse. The lead was careful never to push too far with any single "mark," knowing exactly how much he could get without driving anyone to a breaking point or risking a showdown.
 

 
He knew these wealthy people, well-off and educated, wouldn’t waste too much time on a con artist. In this, he felt both pride and self-loathing.
 

 
On one hand, he found it amusing how easily he could fool these people, how transparent their psychological weaknesses were to him. On the other, he was acutely aware that he lacked their level of education and sophistication.
 

 
If he were the type to believe that “education is useless,” he might have felt more at peace. But this is where the male lead's self-awareness becomes his curse—he knows the value of knowledge, he knows education matters, and he envies those students who can study freely on campus, unburdened by life.
 

 
“He’s the kind of lead that gives you a feeling of ‘something’s not right,’” Song Wanzhuo muttered to himself as he analyzed the character, instinctively envisioning how his own subconscious traits would interpret the role, as any actor would. “He has a sort of self-destructive mindset…”
 

 
The male lead meets the female lead when he hears about some online scams and decides to try his hand.
 

 
In the world of con artists, he’s a ‘real-life success’ type.
 

 
After all, with his looks, his captivating voice, and his persuasive body language, he can easily gain people's trust. Typing on the internet, though, comes off a bit cold and unconvincing to him. He'd heard about a scam called a "pig butchering scheme" that supposedly makes big money, and he found it intriguing.
 

 
The most common form of a pig butchering scheme is a romance scam. Scammers build a relationship with their target, then persuade them to invest or gamble on a specific app. The victim, believing they'll make a fortune, sometimes even takes out loans to continue. Under the scammer's influence, they’re convinced that it's a sure bet with no risks, often ending up deeply in debt and completely devastated.
 

 
On his very first attempt, he encounters the female lead.
 

 
The female lead, with her open-hearted trust in people and her eager, optimistic outlook on life, is everything he lacks.
 

 
And there’s a certain innocent naiveté about her.
 

 
He often finds it hard to believe that in this "5G era" there could be such a clueless girl.
 

 
He convinces himself that she knows a lot about the lifestyle of the wealthy and can teach him about expensive tastes and knowledge he might use in future scams. This justification keeps him from actually scamming her.
 

 
The "romance" scam ends at the stage of "falling in love."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh, come on!"
 

 
Are you really trying to scam her? Or are you just tempted by her innocence?
 

 
The female lead eventually shares her real background, revealing how trapped she feels in her family’s cage of "love." She’s afraid of the outside world but longs to escape, torn between her desire for freedom and her unwillingness to hurt her parents. Just listening to the male lead talk about the outside world brings her joy.
 

 
The outside world? How is he supposed to explain his life to her?
 

 
Tell her he’s just a conman with no real job, and barely any education?
 

 
The male lead doesn’t even know what a “normal” life looks like. He comes from a very dysfunctional family—his parents divorced, each remarried, and his father would hit him whenever they met, saying that if he scared him enough, he wouldn't come around asking for money. His father would tell him to go to his mother for support. But his mother was also struggling to survive; she’d remarried and quickly became pregnant again, trying to secure her place in her new family.
 

 
Asking his impoverished mother for money was out of the question, so he had no choice but to rely on himself.
 

 
He doesn't view his troubled background as an excuse for his crimes. He knows that no one's money is easily earned—he just doesn’t care anymore. Inside, there’s a rebellious child who uses his intelligence to live recklessly.
 

 
The script’s description of the male lead’s background is rich, but the narrative downplays it.
 

 
From the perspective of the female lead, who grew up pampered, everything seems rosy.
 

 
After a suicide attempt that results in amnesia, she’s like Alice wandering into a magical world—innocent, pure, and beautiful. Eventually, a handsome and elegant doctor pulls her out of this "dream," reminding her of her long-forgotten desire for freedom. Excitedly, she asks the male lead, "So, you’re here to take me away, right?"
 

 
The male lead looks at her quietly for a moment, then tells her another truth.
 

 
He reveals his real identity and the true nature of the world he knows:
 

 
Male Lead (calmly): "The world outside isn’t as colorful and fun as I described. It’s full of wolves like me, people with bad intentions. Part of the reason I encouraged you to run away was because I wanted to see you lose your innocence. I’m full of malice, do you understand? The boyfriend you’ve been so fond of—that’s who he really is. And the people you don’t like? They’re even uglier."
 

 
Male Lead: "Your parents may have a strong need to control you, but you have a good life. You have the luxury of never having to grow up."
 

 
The male lead thinks that if he continues using his cleverness just to get by, he’ll never be worthy of such a wonderful girl. There’s no such thing as a boy who can't grow up; there's only a boy who hasn’t met the girl he wants to be responsible for.
 

 
He also knows that because of his past recklessness, he doesn’t deserve to compete for this little princess’s love.
 

 
The weight of everything he’s shared is too much for the female lead to process all at once. She’s stunned for days, and by the time she regains her senses, he’s already gone.
 

 
This leads into the "real-world" storyline: the rosy lens of the luxury estate fades, and he returns to the cold, gray concrete jungle. The male lead finds a legitimate job, attends night classes to improve himself, and scrapes together money to repay his past victims, with interest. He wants to erase the fact that this girl he once adored had fallen for a con artist.
 

 
So, this character who seemed like a prince for four-fifths of the film is now working in sales. He has to meet performance targets and study late into the night.
 

 
The male lead used to believe he’d be a con artist forever.
 

 
The lessons he learned from the female lead don’t go to waste. Slowly, he finds his way and puts his life back on track. When things are tough, he imagines the little princess, living carefree in that lavish estate...
 

 
Reading up to this point, Song Wanzhuo feels the same way.
 

 
But then he reaches the three possible endings…
 

 
1. First Ending: After the male lead confesses the truth, the female lead's view of the world shatters, and she decides to retreat back into the safe, warm nest of her parents. Her controlling parents gain an even more obedient daughter, and she soon forgets the “doctor” who had vanished so abruptly. When she reaches a suitable age, they arrange a match with a well-connected young man, and she has a multimillion-dollar wedding that makes the news—something the male lead catches on TV.
 

 
2. Second Ending: After a brief period of fear, the female lead’s curiosity about the real world only grows stronger. She has a huge fight with her parents, finally gaining her independence. The male lead was right—her parents truly love her but were unaware their parenting style was flawed. Though her rebellion initially hurts them, it ultimately leads to a healthier and lasting parent-child relationship.
 

 
The female lead quickly catches up on over 20 years of real-world knowledge and eventually sets out to find the male lead.
 

 
But by the time she finds him, he has already died from overwork.
 

 
At that point, he’s managed to pay off his debts entirely, leaving behind only a final letter for her.
 

 
At this point, Song Wanzhuo feels a pang in his stomach.
 

 
3. Third Ending: This one is similar to the second, but when the female lead finds him, she realizes that he’s lost his glow. The boy she once loved was an illusion, and instead, the male lead has indirectly helped her complete her last stage of “growth.”
 

 
The prince was a lie, and reality is the dragon.
 

 
After leaving the castle, the little princess is able to pick up her own sword.
 

 
The agent, having finished the script as well, messages Song Wanzhuo: "Wanzhuo, I actually think you'd be a great fit to play the super controlling dad."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: "?!"
 

 
Since love stories are challenging within the instinctual film genre, having multiple endings is fairly typical. Song Wanzhuo thinks over the male lead’s complex character and, betting on Tong Zhao’s streak of hits… even if he doesn’t gain much, boosting the box office numbers could be worth it!
 

 
So, he sends in his interest for the role.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo felt pretty confident. After all, Tong Zhao's films typically don't make the male lead a big draw, so there shouldn't be that many male stars eager to play the part, right?
 

 
Well, he was wrong.
 

 
Quite a few actors started asking if Tong Zhao was really going to do a romance film, and if the male lead would actually have a lot of screen time—or would it ultimately turn into a mystery thriller? Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh at all the questions, realizing she should probably start lining up a director to let them handle the casting headaches.
 

 
Fortunately, finding a director wouldn’t be too hard.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had already expressed a genuine interest in directing the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I'm thinking about financing the film myself. Romance films tend to be costly and hard to break even on, so I don’t plan to take on any other investors."
 

 
Director Shi was known throughout the industry for making only high-budget films.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Which makes it all the more interesting!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It would be my first time directing a film with a budget of only forty million. I’m really curious to see what it’s like to work with such a cash-strapped production!"
 

 
…
 

 
You can't help but think, if it weren’t for his money, how has this guy managed to live this long without someone taking a swing at him?
# Chapter103
Low-budget production means low tolerance for mistakes.
 

 
At the very least, there would be no room for the luxury that Director Shi Qianqiu had when filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where he could simply reshoot scenes when they didn’t come out perfectly.
 

 
When Tong Zhao reminded him of this, he sent back a wide-eyed, startled cat meme, looking left and right. What kind of reaction was that?
 

 
Picture this: like telling a high-roller accustomed to casual online games that they’ll now have to play a subscription-based game. “Sorry, dear, our game doesn’t have auto-navigation, and spending money won’t make you stronger.” Imagine the look of shock on their face—that’s the vibe Shi Qianqiu was giving off.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Just messing with you.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Do I look like the kind of fool who wouldn’t think of something so basic?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Like a rich person with no common sense.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Not talking to you. (Cat meme)]
 

 
…
 

 
How much does this guy love using cat memes?
 

 
Tong Zhao sent him the script, telling him to think it over.
 

 
After putting her phone down, she headed to the bathroom, filled the tub with hot water and added some bath salts, ready to enjoy a relaxing soak.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found Tong Zhao absolutely fascinating.
 

 
If anyone else were self-funding a film for the first time, and he expressed interest in directing, they’d probably jump at the chance—after all, just having Shi Qianqiu’s name on a film guarantees ticket sales and a solid return on investment.
 

 
It wasn’t arrogance; it was simply the objective reality based on the reputation Shi Qianqiu’s movies had built over time.
 

 
A third-rate director has to beg for investments, while a first-rate director has investors lining up to hand over their money.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought Tong Zhao was interesting, but not in an arrogant way, “she’s the only actress who isn’t fawning over me, and now she has my attention” way. No, he was genuinely intrigued by this unconventional person who seemed to pave her own path. It made him want to follow her journey—to work with her on a creative project, which promised a new, doubled sense of freshness and excitement!
 

 
Based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Shi Qianqiu had only self-actualization left to pursue.
 

 
“Let’s take a look at the script first.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu rotated his wrist, and the text from the script projected into the air from his smart watch.
 

 
The latest model was surprisingly stable, allowing him to work on his own tasks while viewing the document.
 

 
…
 

 
When Tong Zhao came out of the bathroom, steam enveloped her face, giving her an air of lazy softness, as if the warmth had soaked into her very nerves. She lazily toweled off her hair with a blow dryer while glancing at her phone, wondering what silly thing Shi Qianqiu had said this time.
 

 
It wasn't easy to keep up with everything.
 

 
Ever since she posted that social media update and word got out that she intended to personally fund a romance film and star in it herself, her work messages had been non-stop.
 

 
Most of them required serious replies.
 

 
Fortunately, those who managed to merit Tong Zhao’s attention were generally polite and professional—no one was too pushy over a movie with an uncertain future. As for work acquaintances she barely remembered, she just replied uniformly: “There won’t be many roles in this new project. Details will be handled once we find the right director. I’m just providing the funding and acting; everything else is yet to be decided.”
 

 
If anyone pressed further, she ignored them.
 

 
Some messages were purely out of genuine concern, like from Director Shi and several other established figures in the film industry who told her not to hesitate to ask if she needed help from any of her mentors.
 

 
Tong Zhao believed they were sincere.
 

 
But ‘Neverland Girl’ had no action elements, so she could only politely acknowledge their kindness.
 

 
She scrolled down to Shi Qianqiu’s message window.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “The script is quite romantic.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Recently, no major romance films have been hits. Compared to blockbuster effects-driven films, the success of romance at the box office is always a bit of a gamble. At least half of the industry investors have no clue what kind of love story can genuinely move audiences.”
 

 
Seeing this made Tong Zhao chuckle.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu talking about romance?
 

 
The message was sent a while ago, but it was as if Shi Qianqiu had predicted her reaction and preemptively added:
 

 
“Don’t laugh. Just because I’m not interested in romance doesn’t mean I’m clueless.”
 

 
“There’s still a demand for romance films. If you can release a quality one at this time… hmm, is this part of your plan? Market research done? No wonder they call you the Midas of the industry.”
 

 
Although the "Midas touch" nickname had a hint of sarcasm, Tong Zhao found that, under Shi Qianqiu’s analysis, her project selection actually sounded incredibly sensible. In just a few sentences, he outlined a profitable path forward!
 

 
She knew that Shi Qianqiu had often taken on the producer role for his past films as well.
 

 
If he weren’t already wealthy, he would have made a fantastic fundraiser.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t boast about his skill or claim he could guarantee box office success. Instead, he simply and sincerely discussed the film’s potential with her. Nothing mattered more than having a director who truly understood film, and after their chat, Tong Zhao made up her mind and happily created a group chat.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Yiming was enjoying a meal at a fast-food place near his home.
 

 
He figured it was about time to head back.
 

 
Ever since the news got out, everyone he knew suddenly switched their tone, trying to buddy up to him. Xu Yiming knew full well that while they might be currying favor with him, the real attraction was the "Tong Zhao" brand. He might have been pleased, but he didn’t bother with any "you didn’t care for me before, but now you can’t reach me" speeches.
 

 
Still, he figured that since there was no shortage of candidates, he could skip over those who had previously rejected him and weren’t particularly outstanding.
 

 
It’s easy enough to find general crew members, but finding a good director is tough.
 

 
With a sigh, Xu Jianming, who was in the middle of lamenting his baldness, suddenly got a notification that he’d been added to a new group chat.
 

 
He looked down.
 

 
"[Tong Zhao] invited you to join the group chat. Other participants: Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is the director I found."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "For the male lead, I want final veto power. Everything else is up to you."
 

 
She said “up to you,” but in reality, she was planning to observe quietly.
 

 
When it comes to making films, Shi Qianqiu certainly has more experience than she does. Watching him up close as he oversees the production, from start to finish, would surely teach her a lot. As for her veto right over the lead actor, Shi Qianqiu readily agreed; in romance films, this kind of decision-making is quite standard...
 

 
If one of the main roles is played by a big star, then ideally, the casting of their on-screen partner would at least match that star’s aesthetic taste without clashing with the character’s personality. Otherwise, any visible tension or indifference would only feel awkward once filming began.
 

 
Both of them approached this rationally and methodically, leaving Xu Yiming completely baffled.
 

 
…
 

 
Wait—Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He rubbed his eyes. Was he seeing this right? This was the most unlikely director to recruit! Everyone knew that Director Shi always preferred to write, direct, and fund his own projects. How could a small-budget film with a $40 million budget possibly get him on board? It wouldn’t even be enough for him to go wild with.
 

 
Xu Yiming didn’t dare bring this up; he was too afraid of scaring off his idol.
 

 
He controlled his excitement, added Shi Qianqiu as a friend, and checked his social media to confirm that, indeed, this was the acclaimed director he had dreamed of working with. Exhaling with relief, he suddenly found the humble snacks in front of him tasted like Michelin-starred cuisine.
 

 
No need to go home.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu on board? His luck must be so good that it’d be safer to stay indoors, avoiding any chance of a freak accident.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao’s phone buzzed with a video call from Jiang Dang.
 

 
A video call?! Who even does that these days? A regular call would’ve been intimate enough. Tong Zhao was a bit taken aback, but since she’d just finished her bath, changed clothes, and blow-dried her hair, she answered without any hesitation.
 

 
On her screen appeared Jiang Dang’s strikingly beautiful, almost surreal face.
 

 
"I'm here to audition," he said.
 

 
On-screen, Jiang Dang was in casual clothes, with a guitar hanging on the wall behind him at home. When he appeared publicly, his team always paid careful attention to his appearance—his manager insisted that since his intellect was a bit off, his looks should make up for it. Jiang Dang looked effortlessly stunning in anything he wore, with a presence that made him an instant heartthrob for countless fans. His aura exuded a certain cold, forbidden charm.
 

 
Although he was somewhat absent-minded, his deep, soulful eyes captivated anyone who saw him.
 

 
With a serious tone, Jiang Dang began analyzing the benefits of them working together.
 

 
First, he explained, their “couple” pairing from The Knives of the Maiden had gained huge popularity; in online communities, many fans perceived their on-screen chemistry as undeniable. By announcing their collaboration now, they could capitalize on the previous film’s momentum.
 

 
Second, he added, he was very emotionally expressive—after all, the fact that he had written so many beloved love songs was proof enough.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s voice was low and melancholic, but his words were pure business.
 

 
He actually made a solid case.
 

 
Despite their characters being hero and villain in the film (with the hero having an official boyfriend), their pairing had somehow amassed a surprising following. Fans adored it, and video editors loved splicing their scenes together. With so many press events and promotional tours featuring them together, for fans, this was the proof of an undeniable romance!
 

 
If they worked together again, the buzz would be instantaneous.
 

 
After listening to his pitch, Tong Zhao replied, "You recited that very naturally."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked at her with a slightly innocent expression and replied without missing a beat, "My manager was worried I might say the wrong thing and offend you."
 

 
His answer made Tong Zhao laugh. Did people really find her that intimidating?
 

 
Jiang Dang really had the face of a villain.
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped laughing and asked, "But do you really want to make another movie with me? Or did your team send you here?"
 

 
In Tong Zhao's eyes, Jiang Dang now appeared to be the obedient, team-following good boy, almost like someone who was resigned to his fate. Of course, if his manager heard this, they’d probably feel wrongly accused... Jiang Dang, in reality, only obeyed when it suited him. When he was stubborn, he could be quite rebellious.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sensing the situation, warned, "You’re not planning on getting beaten up, are you? My next film doesn’t involve any fighting!"
 

 
She genuinely feared that Jiang Dang might say something like, "Sister, take me in."
 

 
The kind of relationship implied by that phrase in certain circles.
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang laughed, amused by her cautious tone. His eyes curved into a smile, his previously cold and ruthless expression now softened into something unexpectedly cute... How should she put it? It was like a small, smooth, and bouncy little orca had just hatched from a prickly ice egg, gazing up at her and softly saying, "I want to fall in love with you, so whenever there’s an opportunity to make a movie, I’ll come."
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned by his directness.
 

 
Just a moment ago, Jiang Dang had been so talkative while rehearsing his lines, but now, on the phone screen, he was silent. After revealing his true intentions, he stared at her intently, the silence radiating an almost overwhelming weight.
 

 
This was definitely the type who didn’t give you any idea of what he might do next...
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily dazed, her mind in turmoil.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Looks like you didn't beat him hard enough last time."
 

 
Xuyi: "Maybe you beat him too hard, and it won his heart."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Interesting, I like him. He's a little better than Wei Zekai."
 

 
Not realizing it and waiting for the girl to chase after him? That’s a bit wishful thinking.
 

 
Consort Chen added his name to her little black book, eagerly awaiting his reaction once he finally understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned.
 

 
Was she falling for him?
 

 
Her mind was in chaos, but she tried to push aside the flood of thoughts and confirm with him: "Do you like me?"
 

 
She almost wanted to say that it wasn’t professional to want to work with her just for this reason.
 

 
But then she thought about it...
 

 
His main job was as a singer; film acting was just a hobby for him. However, it turned out that his acting had been surprisingly well-received by the audience, which was why he sometimes took on roles.
 

 
One important point was that collaborating with a star you genuinely like for a romantic film was actually quite professional in the era of instinctive films. In the entertainment industry, fast-paced love stories were the mainstream. The combination of a real romance and a heartfelt movie often ended with the couple's feelings deteriorating after the shoot, as they got busy with their own schedules and chose to break up…
 

 
That was the norm in the industry.
 

 
"Yeah, I really like you."
 

 
As he said this, Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a cheerful smile.
 

 
With his stunning, almost supernatural looks, he gave off the appearance of a well-behaved and obedient child, like an innocent and gentle trap:
 

 
"After we finished our last movie, I became your fan. Do you want to be a fan of me?"
 

 
...
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fan?!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Be a person, Your Majesty!"
 

 
Tong Zhao calmed herself and replied, "I’ll consider it. I’ll send you the script first. The male lead really suits you, but using you carries a bit of risk. As for the decision, I’ll let you know once the casting results are out."
 

 
"I was just joking about being a fan," Jiang Dang said.
 

 
"I know..."
 

 
"But I really like you."
 

 
?
 

 
If Jiang Dang played FPS games, he’d probably be a great sniper.
 

 
It was too direct.
 

 
Only someone with his straightforward personality would do something like this.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was thinking about how to reject him, Jiang Dang quickly added, "You don’t need to give me an answer right now. I just wanted to express how I feel. I still want to make a movie with you, and that’s all. Nothing else."
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao politely chatted for a few more minutes, and the video call ended without any persistence or clinginess.
 

 
Jiang Dang's demeanor was like a poet encountering the sunset, composing a poem to praise the magnificent scenery that moved his soul. But is it necessary to pluck a cloud from the sky and keep it? Having seen it, liked it, and expressed it—what more is there to do?
 

 
A thousand words can only turn into a sigh...
 

 
Indeed, he was a very special person!
 

 
The casting process moved quickly. After learning that the male lead in this movie, who would act alongside Tong Zhao, had a solid character profile, nearly everyone was eager to land the role. Even though the official casting hadn’t started yet, there were already countless people trying to gather information from her and Shi Qianqiu. Xu Yiming, in particular, was tempted more than ever. Hoping for a breakthrough with this unexpected opportunity, he wasn’t about to make any promises just for short-term gain.
 

 
When the public casting began, Shi Qianqiu shared an idea with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "You know, a lot of popular and reliable young actors are hesitant to work with you because you steal the spotlight too easily."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I know."
 

 
Was Shi Qianqiu deliberately trying to provoke her?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It’s normal for love to have a power dynamic, but ‘Neverland Girl’ shouldn’t be a film where the female character completely overshadows the male. So, I have an idea…"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Can Han Zhi act?"
# Chapter104
Tong Zhao fell into a brief moment of speechlessness.
 

 
In her previous life, after suffering blows and targeted attacks, she became self-destructive and never entered the entertainment industry...
 

 
Thinking about it now, it was such a huge loss!
 

 
No wonder they are at the top of the pyramid; each one of them has a unique style and knows how to stir things up. Tong Zhao admired them, and a smile curved at the corners of her lips. She wasn't in a hurry to reply because, after all, she needed to ask Han Zhi's opinion.
 

 
Han Zhi: [I have no opinion.]
 

 
No personality would turn down anything that could help "Tong Zhao" rise to the next level.
 

 
After experiencing quick transmigration, this spirit of striving for progress had almost been etched into her soul. She wouldn’t suddenly feel discouraged or choose to give up in any world. Instead, she turned every task into a benefit, using this diverse life experience to improve herself.
 

 
[Actually, it’s quite good,]
 

 
Han Zhi thought about his fans in this world.
 

 
A ship can only have one captain. He knew he had to control his exposure and not feed his fans’ appetites too much, or it might have a negative impact on Tong Zhao herself. He and Tong Zhao were one entity—when Tong Zhao became famous, it also satisfied his own desire for fame. The only thing left was his concern for the fans.
 

 
Although Han Zhi didn’t deliberately guide them, many fans still saw him as a potential romantic partner and confessed their love to him in the live stream.
 

 
Perhaps because he wasn’t real, they didn’t fear it collapsing.
 

 
So their love was especially sincere and comforting.
 

 
Tearing rankings?
 

 
It was meaningless.
 

 
Boosting endorsement sales?
 

 
Buy what you can afford, but within reason. If any negative consequences came out of it, the company might decide to stop letting Brother Zhi stream, which would be bad.
 

 
Occasionally, someone would mention on Weibo that Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans were a breath of fresh air in the fan circle, with a heart full of one simple wish—just wanting to see their idol more.
 

 
Han Zhi felt that this had nothing to do with being a “breath of fresh air.”
 

 
In fact, the true intentions of all fangirls were not as brainless and dirty as the outside world imagined. They were simply led astray by various factors, with countless capital forces trying to make them go crazy… His girlfriend fans were indeed a “breath of fresh air,” only because his conditions were special, stripping away the superficial glamour and returning to the original essence of fanhood.
 

 
They just wanted to see him more.
 

 
And he did, too.
 

 
[I want to act.]
 

 
Han Zhi spoke.
 

 
Tong Zhao completely understood his thoughts.
 

 
Meanwhile, Shi Qianqiu was still explaining to her why he had such an explosive idea.
 

 
He had carefully watched the romantic variety show ‘Sea King Kill’ and had a high opinion of Han Zhi: “I didn’t mention similar thoughts before because he’s not suited for my kind of movie. My films focus on big-budget special effects and grand scenes, and his charm point is different from yours. He’s not really suited for such large-scale scenes…”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu further clarified that he wasn’t belittling Han Zhi.
 

 
To put it simply, when it comes to big-budget special effects and grand scenes, Tong Zhao is able to handle them well. She can charge forward with the wind, driving the audience’s emotions and getting them excited for the story’s climax.
 

 
Han Zhi is a different type. He is like a gentle, melancholic vortex—no matter how raging the flood is, he remains like a trap independent from the chaos, making people unconsciously ignore the grand scenes and focus on him, concerned about his emotions.
 

 
Looking at it from another perspective…
 

 
Isn’t this exactly the kind of talent needed for a romance film?
 

 
If the director uses him, there’s no need to worry about the audience not getting into the story.
 

 
It’s not a problem at all.
 

 
The more Shi Qianqiu thought about it, the more he felt that this was exactly the case.
 

 
He almost couldn’t wait to pull Tong Zhao over and push her into the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
The only drawback was that it might reinforce the stereotype that "Tong Zhao can’t work with other male stars"…
 

 
Shi Qianqiu honestly shared this concern with Tong Zhao, leaving her to decide for herself.
 

 
Without hesitation, Tong Zhao replied: “Then let’s book Han Zhi.”
 

 
Let the next movie solve the stereotype left by this one!
 

 
Seeing how quickly she made her decision, Shi Qianqiu no longer lingered on the downside. He eagerly started thinking about the benefits of using Han Zhi. At the very least, the publicity would be easy, as the topic was already hot. The only problem would be the roadshow, but they could try shifting the focus to variety shows and having him appear as a guest.
 

 
The benefits of controlling Han Zhi's exposure had already shown themselves.
 

 
At least his fans and netizens hadn’t grown tired of him yet. The company hadn’t seized this opportunity to over-saturate the market and exploit his popularity.
 

 
Those who stick to their principles end up with the best results in the end.
 

 
...
 

 
The news that Tong Zhao would be filming a new movie quickly spread.
 

 
At first, the industry buzzed with curiosity about the script she had chosen.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had turned down many good script offers recently. She was clearly aiming for something even better. What kind of amazing script could stand out and attract the attention of the box-office queen? This wasn’t a secret; Xu Yiming was building a team under Tong Zhao’s name. Of course, he wouldn’t easily show them the full script, but keeping it under wraps was hard…
 

 
After all, setting up a venue requires renting codes.
 

 
In just two days, the industry knew that Tong Zhao was filming a romance movie set in a luxurious mansion estate.
 

 
However, many people thought that the "romance film" was just a smokescreen.
 

 
They had their reasons, explained with confidence and backed by logic: "Can a romance brain really move Tong Zhao? Don’t think so, it’s definitely a mansion mystery murder case!"
 

 
"If you ask me, it should be a battle for a wealthy family’s inheritance."
 

 
"The possibility of suspense is very high. I think she’s played too many positive roles. Maybe she wants to try a more sinister protagonist. How about a serial killer who kidnaps victims and brings them to a mansion? I want to see her play a sexy Black Widow-style character." This was the opinion of a film critic who was obsessed with imperial assassins, hoping to see Tong Zhao once again play a ruthless character who kills as easily as slicing through vegetables.
 

 
Their analysis was thorough.
 

 
But no matter how reasonable their analysis was, it didn’t matter. Fans and critics were different—fans just wanted to indulge in sweet moments and see more beautiful looks.
 

 
In short, they wanted some sweetness and a beautiful big sister.
 

 
Such simple and unpretentious demands led to a flurry of half-true and half-false rumors and discussions on anonymous entertainment forums:
 

 
"I heard that TZ turned down three scripts this month. What role is she playing in her next movie?"
 

 
"Inside info: TZ’s next movie will reunite her with a certain villain."
 

 
"Groundhog scream! I haven’t seen my steamed bun in a while, where has she gone? Wuwuwu."
 

 
"Stop the waves, TZ’s retiring and getting married."
 

 
...
 

 
The increasing level of absurdity in the rumors showed just how desperate netizens were for information about Tong Zhao’s current status. Fans and insiders were especially sensitive. After all, Tong Zhao had always been known for her career-driven image. She usually didn’t stay idle, with variety shows often filling the gaps between movies. But after ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wrapped up, she had only shown up at the celebration party and had otherwise seemed to disappear.
 

 
The all-powerful paparazzi couldn’t catch a glimpse of her.
 

 
Celebrities who had worked with her were asked about her and became more relaxed with their words: "Tong Zhao? She went out for a walk during the roadshow, couldn’t find her on the street, so save time and do something meaningful."
 

 
Thanks to the efforts of her team, netizens subconsciously received a message:
 

 
Tong Zhao was reducing her exposure, which meant she was starting to raise her profile.
 

 
Capital seeks profit, and as long as Tong Zhao could still carry box office numbers, she remained the darling of investors. But it was clear that Tong Zhao had higher ambitions and wasn’t satisfied with her current position. While her peers were still fighting for exposure and traffic, she had already moved to a different level. Industry insiders said that Shi Dingjun was planning to push for awards for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, and the lead actor might win their first major award since debut...
 

 
It was subtle, but it hinted that Tong Zhao’s team had begun to pursue awards.
 

 
Fans were both happy and disappointed.
 

 
Happy that their sister’s career was moving to the next level.
 

 
Disappointed that they still wanted to see more of Tong Zhao’s work.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao would occasionally livestream to play games, but under the company’s suggestion, her livestreams were indefinitely suspended. The result was that the best opportunity to see Tong Zhao was now in "Han Zhi’s" weekly two-hour holographic livestream. However, in order to create a sense of detachment from reality, Han Zhi rarely mentioned Tong Zhao. When asked in the live comments, he generally wouldn’t respond, and when he did, his answers were mostly distant, like "I’m not sure.”
 

 
How could it not be clear if it’s the same person?
 

 
So, whenever a fan of Tong Zhao carelessly asked similar questions, veteran viewers would explain the rules of the livestream.
 

 
Twenty minutes before the broadcast started today, a typical Tong Zhao fan, someone who had been following her for a long time, barged in.
 

 
[Stop asking, if you want to know Tong Zhao’s schedule, better ask Sister Chu.]
 

 
[Just focus on watching Brother Zhi, okay?]
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan quickly realized and politely apologized to their fellow fans.
 

 
The veteran viewers, understanding that Tong Zhao had been reducing her appearances lately and that her fans were eager for information, didn’t scold the fan.
 

 
Then, they waited. Finally, Han Zhi appeared.
 

 
The livestream screen lit up, revealing a luxurious apartment with minimalist decor (as Tong Zhao’s value increased, the company provided her with more upscale holographic livestream codes, indirectly giving Han Zhi’s fans a sense of "the idol is alive and growing"), and a fully outfitted man entered.
 

 
It was winter in reality, so everyone outside was bundled up, and Han Zhi was no exception.
 

 
He wore a black hat and mask, only revealing a pair of deep, melancholic eyes and a beautifully sculpted nose.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly removed his hat, turned his head, and his ears were flushed red.
 

 
When he took off his mask, his nose, slightly reddened from the cold, took a little bit away from his perfect image but instead made him appear more down-to-earth and approachable. The comment section was full of welcoming messages like "Welcome home, Brother," and some even called him "husband." If you didn’t know better, you’d think Han Zhi had a whole room of wives.
 

 
According to the system settings, the comments would appear in Han Zhi's line of sight as a projection, making it easy for him to see them at any time.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at the comments and, unable to suppress a warm smile, said:
 

 
"Yeah, I’m back."
 

 
[Ahhh, Brother, I missed you so much, can you stream a bit longer today?]
 

 
[Just now, a fan of Sister Zhao came in, but we didn’t scold him, we kindly explained the rules of the livestream!]
 

 
There were even some fans who wanted credit.
 

 
After removing his full disguise, Han Zhi sat down on the sofa in front of the camera, his face showing an indescribable fatigue, as if he had been on a long journey to some faraway place that fans didn’t know about, looking dusty and weary.
 

 
Where had he been?
 

 
No one knew, and that mystery was captivating.
 

 
The handsome young man visibly looked a bit tired, but his gaze remained focused as he read every line of the comments, then slowly and clearly praised them: "Well done, while I wasn’t here, you all behaved very well."
 

 
The comment section exploded with exclamations of joy, as if their hearts were hit by a wave of warmth.
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan who had stayed was a straight guy, indifferent to Han Zhi, and had been informed by other fans that Brother Zhi wouldn’t respond to any questions about Tong Zhao. He was about to leave when he saw Han Zhi call out his name: "She’s preparing for new work recently. I’ve been busy too, looks like I’m a bit tired, huh? But I’m still happy to see you all."
 

 
Many guys, after a whole day of work, will casually say "baby, I love you" to their girlfriends, just wanting to go to bed as soon as possible.
 

 
It’s true they’re tired and want to sleep, but the sincerity of "I love you" matters. The girlfriend can feel it… Saying "I love you" just to avoid being bothered by her is more hurtful than saying nothing at all. A woman might wonder when love words turned into a tool to make her stop bothering him, rather than coming from the heart?
 

 
But Han Zhi had the ability to make tens of thousands of girls believe that what he said was true.
 

 
They believed he was genuinely busy, and when he saw them, he was really happy.
 

 
Many girls in Han Zhi’s fanbase are not conventionally attractive. During his peak popularity, malicious comments were saying that girls who follow idols are generally unattractive and unloved, and those who follow virtual idols are even worse—like the upgraded version of the tank. These words are filled with stereotypes, and individuals in any fanbase indeed vary in appearance, and beauty should not be defined by weight.
 

 
However, hearing such things still hurts.
 

 
In Han Zhi’s livestream, he doesn’t say exaggerated, hollow words. Instead, in the small, subtle interactions, you can feel his love and gentleness toward every fan…
 

 
He’s not in a rush to prove anything; both the fans and he can take their time.
 

 
Confidence is built slowly.
 

 
Fans who are loved by him can't be swayed by the malicious slanders of trolls.
 

 
– “Brother says I’m good and cute, but the trolls say I’m not, who are they to talk? Get lost, trolls!”
 

 
[What’s Brother up to?]
 

 
[I thought Brother was on vacation.]
 

 
“I’m not on vacation. The company gave me some work, so I might get busier soon.”
 

 
[Oh? Is Tong Zhao taking a new movie? Or a variety show? A TV drama?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans assumed that when Brother said he was getting busier, it meant Tong Zhao had new resources lined up.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s exhaustion would affect Han Zhi.
 

 
But this was purely the fans’ imagination. After her cultivation, Tong Zhao was so healthy she could fight ten people at once. Even when the entire production crew was exhausted, she was still full of energy. Her Brother Zhi might look tired, but that was just his personal style—a man who could always pull a pretty girl into his arms and fall asleep together.
 

 
“Can’t say.”
 

 
During the livestream, Han Zhi subtly dropped a big piece of news, and soon, the fact that Tong Zhao was considering taking a new film spread.
 

 
This was part of Tong Zhao’s team’s plan.
 

 
Fans didn’t expect the male lead to be Han Zhi, and assumed that it was simply about Tong Zhao taking a new project.
 

 
The news gradually started to spread in the industry…
 

 
It’s confirmed to be a romance movie!
 

 
So, who is the male lead?
 

 
Fans turned their attention to male stars who had recently cleared their schedules and had the right star power.
 

 
However, some fans who were more knowledgeable about the entertainment industry analyzed that Tong Zhao might cast a newcomer, as established male stars might be reluctant to work with her, fearing they’d be overshadowed by her. “Acting with Tong Zhao” might not be as appealing as they imagined.
 

 
In any case, the least credible rumor about her retiring and getting married was quickly debunked.
 

 
Manager Chu subtly mentioned on Weibo that it was a very traditional romance movie, with no monsters to fight, and that the male lead would be someone no one expected.
 

 
Someone with good intentions shared this with Jiang Dang.
 

 
He was quite disappointed: [Then I have no hope.]
 

 
Friends eating melon: [?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: [Netizens all think that I’m meant to be with Tong Zhao. Since the male lead is someone no one expects, then it definitely isn’t me.]
 

 
The friends and family were at a loss for words for a moment.
 

 
It can't be said to be completely fabricated, but rather, it was something made up out of thin air.
 

 
After analyzing it from every angle, they finally concluded that the male lead for Tong Zhao's project must be a new face that no one has seen before!
# Chapter105
The crew arrived so quickly, like a tornado.
 

 
The crew for ‘Neverland Girl’ quickly came together, and Xu Yiming thought he was dreaming—ever since the director was confirmed to be Shi Qianqiu, he had felt a bit helpless. His attitude toward the two towering figures was full of respect and fear. This was obviously not good for a producer. Fortunately, midway through, Shi Qianqiu deliberately gave him a lot of power, letting him handle things as long as they got done right. It was only then that Xu Yiming evolved from being a sycophant back into a human being.
 

 
Tong Zhao said she didn’t expect him to be so good at managing people.
 

 
Could it be that he had the face of a stepmother but the heart of a real mother?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “What kind of people can you hire with a 40 million budget? It’s still about finding the right foreman that fits the spending level.”
 

 
…
 

 
Sigh, she had overestimated him.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly changed his WeChat note to "Versailles Director."
 

 
So Versailles, yet so annoying.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “By the way, a group of people wants to come for the audition for the lead actress’s parents. Do you want to supervise?”
 

 
They were from the same city.
 

 
But they were both so busy, their schedules never aligned, so they had never had a chance to hang out.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how her career had been smooth sailing since her rebirth, and she hadn’t experienced many auditions. She had only tried out for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ twice and hadn’t seen anyone else audition. Since she was considering upgrading from a piece on the chessboard to the player, understanding the filmmaking process was essential. After confirming the audition date, she squeezed out time from her schedule: “I can come.”
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
Once it was decided, Shi Qianqiu promptly hung up the phone.
 

 
…
 

 
The audition was set for 2:00 PM.
 

 
To save costs, the audition would take place in a relatively simple setting, and the scene would be very short, aiming to assess the actor's compatibility with the role in the briefest possible segment. Tong Zhao had a spa session in the morning, arriving 15 minutes early at the audition location in the afternoon.
 

 
The heating in the minivan was set high, and after walking through the cold air of the parking lot, she entered the warm movie studio building. The alternating hot and cold air made her eyes feel dry, and she regretted not wearing sunglasses.
 

 
She found the audition room and opened the door, just in time to see Shi Qianqiu giving instructions.
 

 
“Xiao Zhao!”
 

 
A worker recognized Tong Zhao and enthusiastically greeted her.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu heard the voice and turned around. As their gazes met, Tong Zhao saw a look of surprise on his gentle, scholarly face. He walked over, looking at her curiously: "Who made you cry?"
 

 
"How can you tell I cried?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu motioned for her to look at the mirror hanging nearby, meant for actors to check their makeup.
 

 
The round mirror reflected her moist, reddened eyes, as if there were traces of tears.
 

 
"Cold and hot air, it irritated my eyes," Tong Zhao explained nonchalantly. "Is everyone here?"
 

 
"They're here. We're just testing the equipment. Do you want to look at the script?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
Because the cost of renting the luxurious mansion for the actual film was too expensive, the audition’s budget would exceed, so Xu Yiming rented another residential location code for the audition background. This savvy cost-saving move impressed Shi Qianqiu, who jokingly referred to him as the "King of Thrift" in their WeChat group.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: Is this considered bullying on the set?
 

 
However, Xu Yiming was thrilled to be praised by his idol and quickly changed his group nickname to "King of Thrift Xu Yiming."
 

 
... The thoughts of a sycophant—humans just don’t understand.
 

 
Now, back to the present.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the paper script.
 

 
The story in the script takes place in a plain, ordinary apartment, with three characters: an elderly couple and their daughter, who returns to her parents’ home after suffering from domestic violence.
 

 
The script was only two thin pages, with few lines, but the scenes were full of tension, and the opening was a conflict.
 

 
Audition Script
 

 
Time: 6:00 PM
 
Location: Apartment #01341, Residential Type
 
Characters:
 
- Father Nie
 
- Mother Nie
 
- Nie Siyan
 

 
Mother Nie is cooking dinner while Father Nie sits at the dining table reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings, and Mother Nie quickly puts down the ladle and rushes to open the door. She finds her daughter, who has returned from her marriage. Her daughter looks exhausted, wearing a thick scarf that doesn't match the current season's temperature (to hide the bruises on her neck).
 

 
Mother Nie asks her why she's home so late and where Lu Junsheng is.
 

 
Nie Siyan awkwardly says that she missed home.
 

 
The beef brisket with potatoes has just finished simmering, and Mother Nie invites her daughter to sit down and eat while they ask about her life. After a brief moment of restraint, Nie Siyan confesses the truth of the domestic violence she has been enduring.
 

 
At first, her parents don't believe her until she shows them evidence of the bruises.

The audition script for ‘Neverland Girl’ is structured to set the scene, observing how actors instinctively choose their responses, which the director and crew then assess for suitability. The team behind ‘Neverland Girl’ is relatively simple, primarily made up of Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao.
 

 
More than twenty people are waiting for auditions, with the queue ordered by fame and price. Once a satisfactory candidate is found, the remaining auditioners don’t need to proceed, keeping costs at a minimum. This is Tong Zhao's first time seeing such an organized audition process, and she's a bit excited.
 

 
The fact that Tong Zhao is supervising the audition is kept a secret from the auditioners—this is a confidential trip.
 

 
The staff is busy, and a helper gently asks if Sister Xiao needs anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao shakes her head.
 

 
Just before the auditions begin, Shi Qianqiu mysteriously brings over a large cup of honey water and snacks.
 

 
Chips, popcorn, milk candy, sweet potato fries—both salty and sweet options are available.
 

 
Like many people, when she's not truly hungry or thirsty, Tong Zhao wouldn't usually bother asking for food. But when it's brought to her, it’s a different story. She accepts the warm honey water and a basket of sweet potato fries, and when she sees a large tub of popcorn, she can't help but laugh: "Are you watching a movie or having a snack?"
 

 
"You're not wrong," Shi Qianqiu replies as he sits beside her. The large screen in the audition room lights up.
 

 
Unlike typical holographic filming setups, the screen for each auditionee shows their name and number above their head, which gives off a bit of a video game character vibe. The first pair to audition are Chen Feilan and Su Qihua, two regulars who often play supporting roles in family dramas. They're known for their strong, dominant on-screen personalities, and they're featured in more than half of the family-oriented, frustrating dramas in the market.
 

 
Their collaboration in family dramas is often so realistic that audiences will jokingly wonder, "When did they install cameras in my hometown?" They usually don’t need a pre-written script to deliver down-to-earth performances, like forcing someone to attend a blind date or using tricks to get them married—it’s all second nature to them.
 

 
Replacing Tong Zhao in the role of the daughter is a temporary actress with a more docile subconscious.
 

 
The purpose of the audition is to see how well the actors fit the role, allowing them to perform freely. Tong Zhao had considered stepping in herself, but Shi Qianqiu stopped her. He said he didn’t want to risk an unexpected mishap, and that if things didn’t go smoothly, they would have to shoot multiple takes. He had prepared two temporary actresses, so there was no need to put her through that.
 

 
The first audition begins.
 

 
Chen Feilan is cooking, while Su Qihua is reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings…
 

 
The opening scene is no problem.
 

 
"Why are you back at this hour? Where’s Junsheng?"
 

 
"He... he’s busy. I don’t know about him, I just missed you, missed home."
 

 
"Come on in, if you miss home, you should come back and have a meal with Junsheng. Mom doesn't mind cooking for one more person."
 

 
A pot of beef brisket with potatoes is placed in the center of the dining table.
 

 
Chen Feilan continued to express her concern, one sentence after another, her words thick with maternal love and worry, each sentence pressing her daughter’s head lower and lower, until she couldn't lift it anymore.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was making notes on his iPad.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the screen: [Satisfying the suppression disguised as love.]
 

 
The daughter nervously explained why she had returned so suddenly, and then, with a hint of crying in her voice, continued: "Mom, he hits me every day, I can't live like this anymore..."
 

 
"He hits you? How is that possible?"
 

 
In the script's setup, the son-in-law is a clean-cut, handsome white-collar worker. He doesn’t look at all like the type of person they imagined would be capable of beating his wife.
 

 
Faced with her parents' disbelief, the daughter had no choice but to roll up her sleeves to prove it.
 

 
This is where the plot takes a turn.
 

 
Su Qihua frowned, accusing his daughter of surely doing something wrong to anger the son-in-law: "You keep running back to your parents’ house to seek justice; all that does is drive a wedge between the couple. So now you’ve just come back here, what do you think your in-laws will say about you?" Chen Feilan covered her face and cried, feeling sorry for her daughter’s misfortune. She stopped her husband from saying more: "Wait, I'll go with you to apologize and buy some gifts to talk things over with your in-laws."
 

 
After a long lecture, the daughter remained silent, her eyes filled with despair.
 

 
Chen Feilan pulled her sleeve back to cover the bruises on her arms, worried about what the neighbors would say if they saw.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao furrowed her brow: "They are more suited for TV dramas."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu agreed: "They can't capture that feeling of indulgence."
 

 
The two exchanged their thoughts on the characters quietly.
 

 
"The parents' original intention of sheltering their daughter was to protect her, afraid she might end up like the older daughter, who died unexpectedly. Even though their love may have unintentionally turned into overprotection, the focus should be on their excessive care for the daughter. Their subconscious can indeed bring out strong conflict in a short amount of time, but it's not the effect I'm looking for," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"Yes, I also want this film to be more romantic and beautiful, not a family drama with trivial matters," Shi Qianqiu agreed.
 

 
"However, with their performance, the part where the daughter argues with her parents for her personal autonomy will definitely be very interesting," he added.
 

 
"Let's see how others perform."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
The second pair of auditionees wanted to take the daughter to the police but hesitated when the daughter blocked them. The family sat together, their faces full of sorrow and tension, staring at the beef brisket with potatoes.
 

 
The third pair, even after seeing the daughter’s injuries, still refused to believe she had been abused. They preferred to believe in their good memories of the son-in-law. He was such a gentle scholar; how could he possibly hit a woman?
 

 
After watching these three pairs, Tong Zhao's eyes were opened.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was patient, showing no sign of impatience. As usual, he asked the staff about the auditionees' details. Since the auditions were ordered by fame, by the fourth pair, the names started to become unfamiliar—names Tong Zhao had never seen before.
 

 
When the screen lit up again, both of them straightened up, ready to observe.
 

 
The previous scene had smoothly progressed with the daughter revealing the cruel treatment she suffered at her in-laws' home.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, "I already know the next line — 'Really? How could that be? Did he just push you, and you overreacted?'"
 

 
Tong Zhao placed a handful of chips on his bucket of popcorn: "Food can't shut your mouth."
 

 
The monitoring screen showed the parents' faces turning pale.
 

 
The actress playing the mother trembled as she gently stroked her daughter's bruises, silent tears flowing down her face as she embraced her, patting her back to comfort her. The actress playing the daughter had already entered the same scene four times, numb and unaware, her sadness and pain frozen into a mask on her face.
 

 
And this mask shattered and melted in the mother's embrace.
 

 
"Nan Nan, don’t go back. Stay here with us, okay?"
 

 
"But..."
 

 
When the parents proactively suggested not returning to that house, the daughter hesitated. The mother then gently coaxed her, using a half-persuading, half-soothing tone. The daughter looked towards her father, who nodded, "Listen to your mother."
 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu didn't stop them early, allowing the three of them to continue for a little while. He then guided the daughter to ask specific questions: "If I divorce Junsheng, I won't have anywhere to live..."
 

 
"How could you not have anywhere to live? You can stay at home, sleep with mom. You used to sleep between us when you were little."
 

 
"I'm older now. It's hard to find a partner for a second marriage."
 

 
The mother embraced her from behind: "If you don't marry, you'll live with me for the rest of your life."
 

 
---
 

 
When the two extra actors stepped out of the holographic filming booth, Shi Qianqiu's assistant approached to inform them that they had been selected to play the parents of the female lead. They were overjoyed.
 

 
The older generation, having grown up in the traditional film era, generally resisted instinct-based films, always thinking that such high-tech equipment must be highly radioactive. So, aside from regular supporting actors, most people auditioning at the film studio were those who were struggling financially and seeking extra work.
 

 
These two extra actors were no exception.
 

 
Zhang Siliang, chosen to play the mother of the female lead, was a single mother, waiting to use her pay to help support her married son. She beamed with happiness and thanked the assistant repeatedly.
 

 
"Why are you thanking me? It was Director Shi's decision," the assistant laughed, seeing the two extras look both thrilled and nervous, afraid they might not perform well in such an important role. The assistant comforted them, "Don’t worry, not only is Director Shi here today, but Xiao Zhao is here too. Both of them think you’re perfect for the role, so just relax and wait for the shoot!"
 

 
Meanwhile, the other auditionees had already moved on to their next auditions, with only the first pair still waiting for notification.
 

 
Chen Feilan and Su Qihua had observed the other contestants before their audition and felt confident they would secure the role, but instead, they waited and waited, only to lose out unexpectedly.
 

 
"How unlucky," Chen Feilan muttered. "Didn't you say you were close to Director Shi?"
 

 
Su Qihua, caught off guard, felt a little guilty. His relationship with Shi Qianqiu was limited to occasionally running into him at the local film studio. He explained, "Didn't you hear? The lead actress is here today too. If she doesn’t like us, what can Director Shi do?"
 

 
"Really lacking vision."
 

 
Chen Feilan took his words seriously, and her opinion of Tong Zhao dropped.
 

 
The strict, controlling parents—he thought they had played better roles than this. Were they really rejecting them just because they were too expensive? Chen Feilan really wanted to indulge her passion for acting in a film, so she placed the blame on Tong Zhao...
 

 
On the other side, after accompanying the other roles through their auditions, Tong Zhao was called over by Shi Qianqiu: "Do you have any plans next?"
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
"I'm hungry. How about we grab a meal on the way? You said you’d treat me last time, but we never had the chance."
 

 
The "last time" referred to when they were filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Tong Zhao's schedule for the evening was indeed free, and the experience of watching the audition together had been light and enjoyable. After a brief thought, she agreed, telling her assistant not to worry about giving her a ride back, as she would just take Shi Qianqiu's car.
 

 
The assistant obediently left in the shuttle car to finish their day early.
 

 
Five minutes later, Tong Zhao stood beside Shi Qianqiu's fluorescent green sports car, suddenly feeling the urge to call the driver to bring the shuttle car back.
# Chapter106
“If you don’t like this one, there are others.”
 

 
There are two types of parking spaces in the film studio.
 

 
One is the public parking space.
 

 
Although it’s called public, it’s actually only open to guests with reservations. So, actors or extras who don’t have contracts or weren’t invited by the studio can only take public transportation or park in nearby lots and walk to the studio.
 

 
The other type is private parking spaces, usually bought by major entertainment companies for their own artists when they come to shoot films or TV shows.
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu led Tong Zhao to another understated black Bentley. Seeing Tong Zhao clearly relax, he smiled lightly with his thin lips: “All the cars at home are black. I’ve gotten a little tired of them, so when I bought a car, I wanted something more colorful.”
 

 
Fluorescent green is too colorful.
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly recalled that Shi Qianqiu’s family seemed to be involved in some gray industries. Then, thinking about "All the cars at home are black"… Ah, so this is the image of an underworld heir that comes to mind. Shi Qianqiu opened the car door for her, and after seeing her expression, even though she hadn’t spoken, he smoothly caught her train of thought: “Yes, I’m the heir of the Shi family who has been wandering outside. Last time I went home, the two rows of cars filled up the entire street, and two lines of men in black suits bowed to welcome the return of the Shura heir.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
After getting into the car, Tong Zhao rolled her eyes at him without any lady-like restraint: “I just thought that your taste in cars should have a lot in common with my childhood friend.”
 

 
To her surprise, Shi Qianqiu even mentioned a familiar name: “Wei Zekai?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t expect him to guess so accurately and was slightly surprised.
 

 
“He’s very simple.”
 

 
“You’re so protective of him, so is the gossip true?” Shi Qianqiu smirked and sat in the driver’s seat.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled up her mask, trying to hide her small face behind it.
 

 
“That tone of yours... I think I’ve seen it somewhere before.”
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu shook his smartwatch, making a few quick adjustments. He then selected the scene he wanted from the massive film library. The small smartwatch was incredibly powerful, directly connecting to the car's sound system. Soon, a dramatic, melodramatic audio clip began to play, with immersive surround sound:
 

 
[Tell me, who is that woman to you?]
 

 
The plain-dressed wife clutched her husband, who was about to leave, and tearfully asked.
 

 
“I don’t even know who you’re talking about.”
 

 
“Don’t lie to me,” the wife sneered, “That new assistant at your company, Mary, just graduated from college, right? She’s so young but already knows how to seduce other people's husbands. How could you do that?”
 

 
Hearing the name Mary, the husband frowned and pulled her hand away: "I don't know what you're talking about. Don't go crazy just because you heard there's a new female classmate at my company."
 

 
"Well, if you're not going to admit it, I even have her phone number and address. Do you want me to take the records of your hotel stays and chats and ask her family about it?"
 

 
When the wife mentioned confronting the mistress, the husband finally couldn't hold it in any longer and his face changed. He shouted at her: "You're crazy! She's not like you, she's very innocent. I need to protect her. Listen, what happens behind closed doors is our business. Do you want to make it so everyone loses face? Is that what will make you happy?!"
 

 
This was a real shout.
 

 
Tong Zhao could only regret that the mask she pulled up couldn't cover her ears.
 

 
"You really find the clips fast. Is it true that if there's a number, you can find any resources?"
 

 
Tong Zhao made a sarcastic remark.
 

 
"Apologies,"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shook his wrist again, and the picture and sound disappeared simultaneously. "It's a professional habit. When I'm not filming, I absorb a lot of information. I’ve watched almost every instinctive movie on the market, including some bad ones. Sometimes, I think they’re bad, but in a creative way."
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything.
 

 
Although she didn’t speak, Shi Qianqiu continued, almost as if reading her mind: "I used to use this trick often when I was dating. No matter the scene, I could pull out the perfect classic romantic lines for the mood... I'm a screenwriter and director, right? So, let the movie speak my romantic lines for me."
 

 
That was quite a move.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Learned something.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You’re not right.]
 

 
"It is quite romantic," Tong Zhao acknowledged, but then became a little curious, "What happened next?"
 

 
"There was no ‘next.’ I'm not in a relationship right now," Shi Qianqiu's black Bentley quietly merged into the flow of traffic. In the rearview mirror, his faint smile reflected, but his eyes had a cold undertone: "I don't think you would be moved by this... If I were your boyfriend and I did this, what would your reaction be?"
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned her chin on her hand, staring out at the scenery passing by quickly, and absentmindedly responded:
 

 
"Me? I’d probably say, 'Don’t talk about work on a date, and if you love me, just say it to my face.'"
 

 
When she said the word "love," her expression softened. The light outside the window illuminated her bright almond-shaped eyes, creating a crescent-shaped glow. It was so beautiful that Shi Qianqiu, in the rearview mirror, couldn’t help but want to take a picture of her. He was eager to do so.
 

 
So, Shi Qianqiu’s thoughts shifted to the topic of filmmaking:
 

 
"By the way, how did you come to choose this script? The script itself is good, but there must be something particularly appealing to you about it."
 

 
Talking about work, Tong Zhao became more animated.
 

 
Although she didn’t know where they were going for dinner, and the drive seemed to be quite long, the two of them kept chatting nonstop about the topic of ‘Neverland Girl’. Before long, they had arrived at the place where Shi Qianqiu had planned to take her for dinner.
 

 
It was a quiet Japanese restaurant located in the middle of the hustle and bustle, operating on a reservation system. The two of them sat down in front of the sushi chef, and soon enough, they didn’t see any other diners—Tong Zhao guessed that they only took one group of customers per time slot.
 

 
This Japanese restaurant seemed to specialize in various types of alcohol. The wooden shelves were lined with a dazzling array of bottles, and even the wine glasses were quite refined. Each dish was paired with a different type of alcohol, served in small sips that didn’t leave a strong alcoholic aftertaste. As soon as Tong Zhao tasted it, she realized that the intention wasn’t to get her drunk.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and teased, “You’ve served me a lot to drink, but it’s not strong enough to get me drunk.”
 

 
“Why would you want to get drunk?” Shi Qianqiu refilled her glass, but only poured a small amount. “I’m not worried about the cost of the alcohol, but if someone gets drunk, how are they supposed to have a decent conversation?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu once again defied her impression of him.
 

 
At private gatherings, he wasn’t the carefree, artsy youth she had expected. Instead, he was capable of making in-depth discussions about the film industry, offering fresh and clear insights:
 

 
"My movies always do well at the box office. What's the secret to success? To put it simply, I know what the audience wants to see. The arrival of instinctive movies has changed the audience, and interestingly, the audience has adapted to the changes of the times faster than many filmmakers. While some directors are still stuck debating how to refine the script and control the plot, the story starts to become too conservative and boring… Isn’t it funny to try and make traditional movies with the techniques used to capture the subconscious?"
 

 
"You’re going to become a big hit, and one of the reasons is that your subconscious is perfectly suited for the kind of problem instinctive movies address."
 

 
"The variety of your subconscious is something I’ve never seen before in all my years as a director."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had a good tolerance for alcohol, but he still drank more than Tong Zhao.
 

 
With the effects of the alcohol, his gaze softened. His eyes narrowed into a gentle smile as he looked at Tong Zhao, and his tone suddenly became softer: "They say your subconscious is unstable and not suitable for instinctive films, but I don’t agree. And I’m a successful director, much more successful than those who say such things..."
 

 
He paused.
 

 
There was much more he wanted to say.
 

 
For example, the reason Shi Qianqiu wanted "Han Zhi" to play the male lead wasn’t just because he recognized that this aspect of her subconscious was indeed well-suited for the role, but also because he wanted to uncover more of the charming sides of Tong Zhao’s subconscious—why, just because her subconscious was different, did they say she wasn’t suitable? He didn’t believe it.
 

 
However, when these words were spoken, they felt a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Passersby and fans who didn’t know the truth might think this was a sweet conversation between a domineering director and his favored star.
 

 
But that wasn’t the case.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu just really wanted to work with the instinctive actor he had his eye on and slap all the naysayers in the face.
 

 
...
 

 
The dinner went very smoothly.
 

 
As the two of them took the elevator downstairs, Tong Zhao’s lips, hidden behind her mask, curved into a pleasant smile.
 

 
When the elevator doors opened, Tong Zhao was about to say something, but just as the words were on the tip of her tongue, the sound of a camera shutter interrupted her. Tong Zhao quickly turned her head, her almond-shaped eyes narrowing sharply as she focused on the source of the sound.
 

 
The paparazzi didn’t expect her to react so quickly.
 

 
But so what?
 

 
The target had seen the camera, and the entertainment reporters were thrilled to capture the shot. Tong Zhao made a quick decision in that instant—her gaze became indifferent as she turned away, walking toward Shi Qianqiu’s car. She didn’t care how the paparazzi got her whereabouts, as it was impossible to guard against everything, unless she locked herself inside her house 24/7...
 

 
#Tong Zhao Secretly Meets Director Shi#
 

 
#Tong Zhao’s Relationship Exposed#
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, nearly as soon as she got home, the trending topics followed right behind her. It seemed like the paparazzi couldn’t wait to sell the photos. Tong Zhao had already given Chu Jie a heads-up, and PR had decided not to buy the batch of photos. They just treated it as movie publicity. The gossip was easy to explain—movie collaboration, she went to the audition in the afternoon, then grabbed a bite afterward. What was so strange about that?
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming rumors, Tong Zhao sipped a cup of hot tea to calm her nerves and sober up.
 

 
This time, she was much more calm on WeChat.
 

 
It seemed her friends had learned to tell the difference between fake and real news—especially the partners from Zeshan Ventures, who were particularly unfazed. They watched Wei Zekai worry and, one by one, calmly continued chatting, with one person even posting "99" on the screen.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her phone to check and immediately laughed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Aren't you guys worried???]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The wild man is going to steal Tong Zhao!!!]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Give it up, if Sister Zhao wasn't single, she would definitely tell us.]
 

 
Second Generation B: [He’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out.]
 

 
Second Generation C: [No one would really be triggered by just a few photos, right? No way, right?]
 

 
No one understood Wei Zekai. He was frustrated.
 

 
Wei Zekai angrily sent an emoji of a punch:
 

 
[You don’t understand, Shi Qianqiu is no simple character. I’m worried that Tong Zhao is too naive and might get tricked.]
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao saw this message, she momentarily lost focus and thought about the melodramatic TV drama that Shi Qianqiu had played for her. The other partners from Zeshan Ventures weren’t swayed by his words. After all, no matter how you looked at it, it was only Sister Zhao who was playing someone else. She was too naive to get tricked? Uh...
 

 
It was probably only Wei Zekai who thought that way.
# Chapter107
This relationship is a bit twisted, really. Wei Zekai doesn't know Shi Qianqiu personally. What he knows is Shi Qianqiu's younger brother, Shi Wandong, who has always obediently followed the family's plan, shouldering the responsibility of inheriting the family business. For years, he has diligently managed the group, ensuring his older brother could lavishly spend his earnings in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai doesn’t have many friends, but it turns out he has one she didn’t know about.
 

 
The reason he doesn’t have many friends is that he has a sharp tongue and is picky about people. Additionally, the aura of the eldest son of the Wei family is always intimidating. However, once you become his friend, you’ll realize that behind this "intimidating" exterior, the truth is that he’s "easy to handle"...
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Wandong is a good person, just busy, so we never had the chance to hang out together.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I told him before, everyone thinks I’m unreliable, but only he and you think I’m good. Why do you think that is? He said that growing up with his older brother made him see everyone as more reliable than his brother. But Wandong is a bit of a "brother's boy"—he complains, but still works tirelessly. Every time Shi Qianqiu has a new film release, he always organizes employees to go watch it, paying for the tickets himself.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao listened to him, she began searching online.
 

 
What popped up about Shi Wandong was an elite figure who resembled Shi Qianqiu by about seventy to eighty percent. He wore a suit and gold-rimmed glasses, looking like a reliable good boy—though he looked a little older, he didn’t resemble Shi Qianqiu’s younger brother at all. In fact, he looked more like Shi Qianqiu’s older brother. Tong Zhao clicked through a couple more pages and even stumbled upon some fanfiction about the two of them in a "bone-crushing" (medical) couple pairing... What the heck! Tong Zhao, who couldn’t stomach the "real" couple pairing, quickly covered her face and exited the page, desperately clicking the "X" to protect her eyes.
 

 
Wei Zekai rambled on, providing examples of Shi Qianqiu being "no saint."
 

 
For instance, he once tricked his younger brother into doing his summer homework by claiming it was to "prepare for higher-level courses." For a whole year, Shi Wandong did all his homework for him, only to be caught by their mother, which finally put an end to it. This kind of brotherly betrayal actually managed to fool Shi Wandong into thinking it was a "warm" memory of his older brother being overly considerate about his studies.
 

 
For example, every time Shi Wandong brought a girl he liked home to study, the girl would inevitably fall in love with his older brother.
 

 
Since Shi Wandong admired his older brother so much, the stories created by his brother were naturally considered sacred. He ended up receiving the treatment of "asking his younger brother which character he liked, and then killing off that character" and "getting sabotaged during the climax."
 

 
Wei Zekai summarized:
 

 
[As an only child, half of my sense of happiness comes from Shi Wandong’s daily life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What about the other half?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The distribution of assets in my father’s will.]
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao, being so honest, didn’t know how to respond and really wanted to immediately forward this to Uncle Wei.
 

 
Unknowingly, the bad mood she had been in, caused by those odd and frustrating people, faded away as she read through one new message after another. The corners of Tong Zhao's lips curved into a gentle smile: [Alright, I get it. Not in a relationship, but working, huh?]
 

 
The topic naturally shifted to her new movie.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a mental note of all of Shi Qianqiu’s black history.
 

 
But knowing this person’s thick skin, even if she brought it up in front of him, his most likely reaction would be to take pride in it rather than be ashamed.
 

 
Ah.
 

 
Back to their scandal.
 

 
The paparazzi they ran into that day had great photography skills, and the photos turned out beautifully. After post-production filters, they captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu looking relaxed and at ease during their casual conversation, as well as her alert gaze when she realized she was being photographed. Netizens commented that it was like a switch from Omega to Alpha in an instant. Some even fantasized about the "cold and guarded towards the world, but affectionate and gentle only to you" CP (couple) dynamic...
 

 
In public, Tong Zhao always exuded a star-like aura.
 

 
It wasn’t just about what she wore, but also her facial expressions and overall demeanor. She was so beautiful that it gave off a sense of distance, never disappointing her fans.
 

 
It was rare to see her in casual attire and with a more relaxed expression, which fans took as a sweet treat, excitedly calling her "Zhao Bao" (a nickname for her).
 

 
The fans, however, were fine.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always been very tolerant of the group of people who adore her, and she only controls them a little when they show signs of aggression. Other than that, she doesn't mind when they joke around or ship her with others. After all, even the purest of actors can't avoid the fan economy; it's just a matter of the extent of their influence. Who can really be harsh on those who genuinely adore them? At least she can't. That's why she has always treated her fans like half-clients.
 

 
As long as she can satisfy them, she does her best to do so, but overall, she follows the company's and her own preferences.
 

 
When she saw clueless passersby and gossiping marketing accounts stoking the fire, Tong Zhao became a little annoyed. After discussing it with her company, she decided not to respond or clarify on her own. Let people guess all they want. If this scandal lasts until the film's promotional period, it would probably be too late to debunk it, and it could even help generate some buzz.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wants to clarify things, Tong Zhao would cooperate.
 

 
What if he suddenly wants to date someone?
 

 
It wouldn't be a good influence.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't want to be foolish and ask him how he planned to handle their scandal.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known as the "Weibo King" of the director's circle, didn't post anything to clarify.
 

 
Fans kept gossiping in his comments, and after he blocked a group of them, there were still strange comments like: [I don't support you dating Tong Zhao. Such beautiful and high-quality genes should be passed on. Since Director Shi is childfree, he should let her go.] Some even posted image comments: [They are a perfect match, how dare you, this monster, oppose them? JPG]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t bother responding, fully showing his noble and cold demeanor.
 

 
As the public discourse became heated, Tong Zhao visibly became more low-key. It wasn't until the early preparation work for ‘Neverland Girl’ was complete and the film was ready to start shooting that she went to the film studio, escorted by her assistant and driver.
 

 
...
 

 
For the part of the female lead losing her sanity, in typical instinct-driven films, the effect is often achieved by blocking part of the actor's memory backstage.
 

 
But the result is often mediocre.
 

 
It’s similar to the performances of inexperienced actors.
 

 
Even when they have amnesia, you can still tell they are acting with the mindset and demeanor of an adult.
 

 
Since this was a self-invested film, Tong Zhao boldly proposed a segmented filming approach, just like for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. The amnesia part would be played by Zhao Zai, and the parts before amnesia and after the memory recovery, where the character becomes stronger, would be played by herself.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu unconditionally supported her innovative proposal.
 

 
With the director's support, the matter was settled.
 

 
The female lead of ‘Neverland Girl’ was originally depicted as soft and dreamy, just like when she embarked on her journey into the world of "quick transmigration" (a type of genre where the protagonist travels between different worlds). She was well protected by her family, never suspecting that the evil wolf was right beside her or that her seemingly perfect best friend was secretly jealous of her to the point of madness…
 

 
The script's early stages were tightly controlled, and even though Tong Zhao's subconscious was stronger and more independent than the character's setup, she wouldn't stray too far from the role.
 

 
All the actors lay in the holographic filming chambers, connected to the equipment.
 

 
The large screen on the control desk displayed the connection status of all the devices and whether the corresponding props' codes were in place.
 

 
The most unique aspect was that only one device was shown for the lead role.
 

 
This device was connected to two modules, with one brain supporting the performances of two characters. The medical team’s gaze at Shi Qianqiu was filled with reproach, while their gaze at Tong Zhao, earlier, had been as if looking at a madwoman.
 

 
A madwoman who was willing to be cruel to herself in pursuit of the perfect ideal she had in mind.
 

 
“Neverland Girl, Action!”
 

 
...
 

 
The first thing that came into view was a luxurious mansion.
 

 
Tong Zhao received a share of the profits. The mansion, rented and then painstakingly remodeled by a template designer over half a month, represented a significant portion of the film's budget. Everywhere you looked, there were carefully arranged flowers and plants, creating a dreamy paradise that every young girl had once fantasized about. The color scheme was a harmonious blend of soft pastel pinks, blues, and yellows, resembling the style of a Disney theme park.
 

 
It was indeed a bit extravagant.
 

 
But it was the choice made after discussions between Shi Qianqiu and the art director of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
"My name is Shiya."
 

 
The camera automatically captured the lead character's movements, giving a shot of the female lead stretching after waking up.
 

 
Tong Zhao, dressed only in a white silk camisole, bathed in the soft morning light. The floral print on the curtains cast intricate shadows on her pale white arms, making her appear even more ethereal. One of the similarities between instinctive cinema and traditional cinema is that it allows the actor’s face to be modeled with makeup and claims this is their bare face just after waking up...
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t need that.
 

 
She didn’t require makeup.
 

 
Even the template designer was amazed—she could wake up early in the morning, fresh-faced, without any makeup, and still hold up to high-definition filming without a single flaw. At that moment, her expression was slightly drowsy, and a yawn caused a physiological tear, moistening her almond-shaped eyes, giving her a strong youthful vibe.
 

 
The maid, who had gotten up even earlier, stood by the bed with her hands at her sides. Once her mistress finished stretching, she skillfully helped her get dressed.
 

 
"It was always my mom who helped me get dressed. After she pulled a muscle last month, I heard the doctor told her she had to sit in a wheelchair for half a month. She reluctantly let Sister Mianmian help me instead."
 

 
"Although it feels a bit wrong..."
 

 
"But because of this, I now have one more person I can see, so I’m kind of happy."
 

 
“Sister Mianmian, I can do this myself.”
 

 
Seeing the maid about to kneel down to help her put on her shoes, Tong Zhao kindly stopped her.
 

 
The maid, however, hurriedly lowered her head, saying, "Miss, please don’t call me by my name. Madam might be upset if she hears."
 

 
The maid, with her head lowered, didn't notice the look of disappointment that appeared on Tong Zhao's face.
 

 
"I have a pair of very wealthy and loving parents."
 

 
"—It's just that they don’t like me interacting with others."
# Chapter108
The filming period for ‘The Neverland Girl’ turned out to be much longer than the industry had expected.
 

 
Generally speaking, the more special effects and large-scale scenes a movie has, the longer it takes to shoot. If the movie spans a large time period, the actors need to take breaks from the shooting tent at regular intervals, which extends the filming schedule. But ‘The Neverland Girl’... it was said to be a love story set in a luxurious mansion, with the main characters meeting online. Does it really need that much time to shoot?
 

 
Could it be that there are a lot of special effects in the villa?
 

 
The staff signed confidentiality agreements, and director Shi Qianqiu wouldn’t reveal anything, so outsiders could only guess, and the speculation was getting more intense, becoming more and more outlandish.
 

 
There was another theory.
 

 
That is, Tong Zhao had gone overboard.
 

 
He had to play two roles in a variety show, which was a sacrifice for the program team, and showed his loyalty. But could he really apply the same approach to filming a serious movie? Wasn’t he overestimating his subconscious while underestimating the difficulty of acting in a real movie? This led to a lot of criticism, and even the director, Shi Qianqiu, was seen as someone who loved stirring up trouble. Could this romance film really be reliable?
 

 
Some industry peers took advantage of the situation, and there were even whispers that competitors planning to release films around the same time were subtly shifting the narrative...
 

 
At first glance, the entire market had very little confidence in ‘The Neverland Girl’!
 

 
For other films, such rumors could damage investor confidence, leading to a conservative attitude towards marketing and distribution, ultimately creating a vicious cycle for the movie’s release. After all, in the entertainment industry, both star-making and box office revenue rely heavily on hype and traffic.
 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was different.
 

 
Whether or not the investment was made depended entirely on how Tong Zhao felt, and then on the director’s name.
 

 
Well, even if this movie was short on funds, it likely wouldn’t need to look for outside help.
 

 
Journalists, like hyenas smelling blood, flocked to the scene, using all their connections and methods to dig up any information from the crew. There’s no wall that doesn’t leak, and through their relentless efforts and mysterious tactics, they finally managed to uncover a piece of information.
 

 
What was it?
 

 
During the filming of ‘The Neverland Girl’, an additional investment was made. The amount remains undisclosed. This investment wasn’t publicly announced and was quietly added. If not for the reporters obsessively digging for details, it likely wouldn’t have been revealed. Where was this extra funding used? Was there a miscalculation in the budget? Is this yet another issue with a film funded by Tong Zhao? Countless questions were raised, but no one from the production team came forward to respond.
 

 
# ‘The Neverland Girl’ Suspected of Financial Issues
 
# Tong Zhao's First Major Setback
 

 
Voices predicting failure were everywhere, and such negativity should have shaken the confidence of potential moviegoers.
 

 
However, this common scenario seemed ineffective when it came to Tong Zhao. It was almost as though the public had a soft spot for her. The truth was simpler: her past works were so exceptional that they had instilled a reflexive thought in viewers—’Tong Zhao = Worth Watching’. The industry was shocked to uncover a startling fact:
 

 
These typical negative rumors, which would usually dampen the spirits of most film crews, had no impact on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Like many established veteran actors, she had achieved the rare ability to carry a film’s box office performance entirely on her own.
 

 
[Not listening, just watching Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Whether the movie is good or not, I’ll decide after watching it. How can you criticize a film that hasn’t even released a trailer?]
 

 
[A movie featuring Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu running out of money? That’s laughable.]
 

 
Fans naturally hoped their idol would continue to rise, each film breaking new records, becoming a walking miracle. This sentiment was true for most celebrities, but for Tong Zhao—who had repeatedly succeeded with vastly different genres—fans were even more fervent in their desire for her to deliver a perfect masterpiece.
 

 
One entertainment blogger commented:
 

 
[Are film critics being too harsh on Tong Zhao? Actually, the person who is the harshest on Tong Zhao is herself. After her success as the noble consort in ‘Emperor Ming’, she could have easily taken on more palace intrigue costume dramas. Smooth sailing, right? But she didn’t. After ‘72 Hours Countdown’, she had the perfect opportunity to transition into big-budget action movies—a guaranteed box office hit. Easy money, right? But she declined. I even saw someone on a forum say Tong Zhao has the kind of face that makes people want to fall in love, but she never takes on the safest romantic films. Romance movies? Too easy for her, apparently.
 

 
Yet, what did she do? She filmed one anyway. Surprising, isn’t it?
 

 
Even more surprising, she managed to drag Shi Qianqiu along with her.]
 

 
This entertainment blogger’s post didn’t have any manipulated comments, just genuine opinions from fans and casual viewers. The mainstream sentiment was one of recognition for Tong Zhao. A male fan who had followed her gaming livestreams shared his thoughts:
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s livestreams? I’ve watched every single one. If I missed a live session, I’d catch the replay. I can tell you, from her gaming style alone, you can see she’s adventurous and bold, willing to take risks and show off her skills. You can see this in her attitude towards life as well.]
 

 
Netizens were curious: ‘Has she always been this brave?’
 

 
She really has.
 

 
Some fans even edited a short clip from one of her livestreams.
 

 
In the clip, Tong Zhao is playing a hero character and pulls off two extreme plays in a row while barely surviving on low health, as if walking a tightrope. The chat is filled with comments asking how she dared to make such moves. Smirking, she replied, “Why wouldn’t I dare? Am I afraid of losing? Only those who dare to lose deserve to win.”
 

 
Her expression was full of wild confidence.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s usual public demeanor is calm and composed. It’s only during these rare livestream sessions that fans glimpse her youthful, daring side, and they absolutely love it. After every livestream, platforms like Douyin and Weibo explode with expertly edited highlight clips of her, attracting a whole new crowd of non-moviegoing fans. Many marvel at her gaming skills, saying, “If she became a full-time streamer, she’d definitely go viral. Why is she a movie star instead?”
 

 
One screenshot of her with a puzzled expression, paired with the quote “Am I afraid of losing?”, became a favorite response among fans to counter the critics doubting her.
 

 
So, how did ‘The Neverland Girl’ turn out?
 

 
The first ones to find out were critics and industry insiders.
 

 
Film previews come in many forms: some are rough cuts meant for internal viewing, requiring strict non-disclosure agreements, while others are polished, final versions. The preview for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was the latter. Many media professionals were invited to this event. Although the attendees signed confidentiality agreements barring them from discussing the plot in detail, they were allowed to share their overall impressions.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng was one of the invited critics.
 

 
When he received the invitation, Luo Yuanfeng was surprised.
 

 
He hadn’t expected to be invited.
 

 
It wasn't due to a lack of reputation. Luo Yuanfeng was a fairly influential film critic in the Chinese film industry. Since the advent of instinctive films, ticket prices had risen, and audiences became more cautious about a film’s quality before purchasing viewing rights. Luo Yuanfeng's review column, ‘Luo's Instinctive Musings’, brought him steady income with each new review. This revenue came from the film review site ‘Now Showing’, which paid him based on the number of clicks. Additionally, he received a share of the advertising revenue.
 

 
If a film critic overly compromised their credibility for money, it would harm their reputation, and ‘Now Showing’ would reduce their weight on the platform, indirectly limiting their exposure. Under the site’s strict oversight, most critics took great care to protect their reputations, leading to relatively fair reviews.
 

 
Among the well-known critics, Luo Yuanfeng was part of the camp predicting Tong Zhao’s new movie would fail.
 

 
If the film turned out well, fine.
 

 
But if anything was off, he was ready to tear it apart.
 

 
"It seems Tong Zhao has a lot of confidence in this movie," Luo Yuanfeng remarked to the critic seated next to him. "I don't know if I should hope for it to flop... It's a weird feeling. I kind of want to be proven wrong but also dread being disappointed."
 

 
"You’re overthinking it. I feel like just seeing Tong Zhao’s face in a romance is worth the ticket price."
 

 
This sentiment mirrored the broader public opinion.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s movies were undeniably entertaining and worth the price of admission. However, she had never played out a romance that truly resonated with audiences. Even in the closest attempt, ‘Heartless Tribulation’, viewers mostly felt her overwhelming hatred and solitary intensity. Any love she had for the male lead in flashback scenes was largely the product of Shi Qianqiu’s editing.
 

 
And most importantly, the scumbag male lead didn’t deserve her!
 

 
But Han Zhi? He was perfect!
 

 
From keyword trends and search data, it became clear that seeing Tong Zhao experience a sweet romance in a movie was a key excitement factor for many young fans.
 

 
"Do you think she’s even capable of romance?" someone wondered.
 

 
"I feel like she’s already crushed most of her male fans’ dreams."
 

 
"I’m probably more of a ‘younger brother fan.’ She’s my ideal big sister type."
 

 
...
 

 
Without needing a reminder, the room fell silent as the lights dimmed for the screening.
 

 
With a critical mindset, Luo Yuanfeng leaned forward slightly, focusing his attention to the maximum.
 

 
If this was a good film, he would write an honest review.
 

 
If Tong Zhao’s performance fell short...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng had no intention of holding back.
 

 
Beyond the questions of her dual role performance and whether she could convincingly portray romance, another thought lingered in his mind: what exactly had that mysterious additional funding been used for?
 

 
The movie began with a young, childlike version of Tong Zhao leaning lovingly against her mother in a cozy children's room, listening to her tell the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
 

 
Instinctive films, like traditional movies, often cast child actors resembling the adult leads to portray their childhood selves. The difference, however, lies in the nuances—subtle body adjustments in modeling aren't the same as complete overhauls. When an adult's subconscious is projected onto a childlike frame, the result can feel uncanny. Yet this film opened with an unconventional approach.
 

 
It must be said: the "mini" version of Tong Zhao was utterly adorable.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng, the self-proclaimed stone-hearted critic who had lambasted the entire entertainment industry, felt an inexplicable pang of guilt when he saw the character's bright, teary eyes. ‘How could I possibly criticize such a sweet little girl?’ he thought. ‘If she wants to make this movie, let her do it!’
 

 
"I wish I could be like Peter Pan and never grow up," mini Tong Zhao declared.
 

 
"Then stay by Mom and Dad’s side forever, okay?" her mother replied.
 

 
"Okay!"
 

 
The little Zhao cuddled against her mother, playfully rolling on her lap.
 

 
But she rolled too far—landing with a soft ‘plop’ onto a cushioned mat on the floor. Holding her forehead in her tiny hands, she looked up at her mother in bewilderment.
 

 
...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng thought to himself, ‘I shouldn’t have mocked that fan who called himself her “little brother.”
 

 
‘Now I want to be her “dad fan”!’
 

 
He noticed how little Zhao, nestled beside her mother, would occasionally tug gently at her skirt with her small fingers or nuzzle her soft, chubby cheeks against her mother’s hand.
 

 
These were subtle, childlike gestures unique to this younger version of Tong Zhao—gestures completely absent in her adult self.
 

 
How was she able to do this?
 

 
Seeing this petite version of Tong Zhao, Luo Yuanfeng saw not only an impossibly cute little girl but also a phenomenon beyond comprehension. The same subconscious mind that could switch between cold ruthlessness and captivating allure in her adult roles somehow managed to adjust its temperament to perfectly suit a childlike innocence.
 

 
But how could an adult’s subconscious fit so seamlessly into the body of a child?
 

 
And not just any adult—a celebrity’s subconscious at that!
 

 
In Shi Qianqiu’s lens, Luo Yuanfeng felt as though he were truly traveling through time, catching a glimpse of Tong Zhao before her family life was upended.
 

 
The screening room, filled with some of the most disciplined and professional viewers, couldn't help themselves. At that moment, the audience broke into soft murmurs, marveling at what they were witnessing.
# Chapter109
Incredible...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng couldn't focus on analyzing the rest of the movie's plot.
 

 
The mini version of Tong Zhao on the screen even seemed a bit unfamiliar. As someone who had been closely following the rise of this popular star, Luo Yuanfeng knew her better than many of Tong Zhao's fans... though of course, he couldn’t say they were particularly close. The Tong Zhao he knew was the epitome of mature and cold beauty. He had even had the privilege of witnessing her display her charm at the premiere of ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Of course, many idol stars who were new and lacked background would subconsciously flaunt their charms to gain attention and special treatment, with some going so far as to overstep boundaries. After all, many powerful figures in those circles controlled resources that newcomers desperately sought. Luo Yuanfeng didn’t judge these people, but Tong Zhao was different. Every frown and smile of hers exuded a mature, seductive charm, yet she always knew how to keep things perfectly balanced... At least, no one who had interacted with her felt that she was the type of star who could be bought with money.
 

 
She was the kind of unattainable, unreachable beauty.
 

 
Yet, people still wanted to exert effort to please her, to win her favor, just to see her turn around and smile at them.
 

 
In short, Luo Yuanfeng’s impression of Tong Zhao was that of a mature, cold, fox-like beauty.
 

 
What Luo Yuanfeng didn’t know was that the Tong Zhao he had seen back then—
 

 
Was the very same rare personality who hardly ever appeared in real life. If she did appear, her WeChat contacts would inevitably gain a flood of high-profile, influential personalities: Consort Chen.
 

 
After the childhood of the female lead was revealed, the scene in the movie shifted, and grown-up Sylia appeared. Shi Qianqiu, a director with extensive experience, not only packed the screen with enough visual information, but his shot composition also allowed the audience to easily understand the kind of environment the female lead grew up in. The buildings on screen were magnificent, and her parents were overly doting on her, yet the audience could still sense that something was off.
 

 
Seeing this, Luo Yuanfeng quickly forced himself to snap out of his shock over the younger version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Summon your professional spirit!
 

 
Focus on finishing the movie. This early screening doesn’t offer a replay.
 

 
‘Shi Qianqiu is a genius at directing…’
 

 
‘Who’s the art director for this film? Shi’s aesthetic sense remains top-tier.’
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng knew the primary filming location for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was a bare-bones villa with a small garden at most.
 

 
What appeared on the big screen, however, was far beyond that. Every blade of grass and every tree exuded the painstaking efforts of the art director and the production team. The setting lacked any ostentatious "new money" vibe and didn’t conform to the reserved elegance of "old money." Instead, the exaggerated details and lighting crafted a dreamlike fairy-tale world.
 

 
Just as Luo Yuanfeng was reflecting on this, the adult Tong Zhao made her appearance.
 

 
’This isn’t the same Tong Zhao I’ve seen in person.’
 

 
Accompanied by lighthearted music, Tong Zhao appeared on screen bathed in the golden glow of morning sunlight. "Tong Zhao always looks so stunning under Director Shi’s lens," someone whispered. "Didn’t they have some romance rumors recently? Maybe there’s some truth to it." When Tong Zhao flashed a slightly sleepy, lazy smile at a maid, Luo Yuanfeng began to doubt his own memories.
 

 
It’s a well-known fact in the entertainment industry that many celebrities’ public personas are fabricated. Believing the personas crafted by entertainment companies to be the stars' true selves would make anyone a fool.
 

 
Typically, the consensus is that these stars—often masters of time management, notorious heartthrobs, or femme fatales—pretend to be innocent in front of the camera. But with Tong Zhao, the situation seemed reversed. Could it be that her usual seductive, coldly elegant, and wise demeanor was an act? Was she, in reality, a sweet and soft-hearted young girl? Or even capable of convincingly playing a childlike role?
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng wasn’t alone in his astonishment.
 

 
Most critics had expected Tong Zhao’s take on a romance film to feature a dynamic where, even if not female-dominated, there would at least be equality in power and agency.
 

 
But wait—who was this obedient, innocent darling who seemed ready to be whisked away by any man?
 

 
Was ‘Sylia’ played by some freshly debuted young idol?
 

 
And, oh, it looked like someone was actually going to kidnap her character!
 

 
Some critics who hadn’t read the script beforehand sighed when Han Zhi made his entrance. “If Tong Zhao were a man,” they remarked, “there’d be no competition for male leads in the industry—this guy’s charm is off the charts...”
 

 
Wait, what?
 

 
This guy’s a con artist?
 

 
Han Zhi, doubting that his girlfriend’s mental state had truly reverted to that of a child, infiltrated the Si family as a doctor. Seizing a moment when they were alone, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her, leaning close. “You really don’t remember anything?” Sylia shook her head, staring at him in confusion. He kissed her again, this time more passionately. “Truly don’t remember, or just pretending not to?”
 

 
And so, he kissed her again. And again. And again...
 

 
Critics & special audience members: ..
 

 
Anger rising. Fists clenched.
 

 
This scene went surprisingly smoothly, something Shi Qianqiu hadn’t anticipated.
 

 
After her subconscious was "juvenilized," Tong Zhao's personality became simple and naive but still remained firm and proactive—a child with her own strong opinions. She didn’t seem like someone who would passively allow a strange man to shower her with a whirlwind of kisses. However, Han Zhi was essentially ‘Tong Zhao herself’. Subconsciously, Zhao Zai (the childlike version of Tong Zhao) felt an instinctive closeness to that face. In her subconscious mind palace, only Han Zhi and Lu Xianzhang (another character) had her trust, while the Imperial Concubine sister constantly bullied her.
 

 
When it came to projecting a sense of youthful innocence, Tong Zhao employed a bit of cleverness.
 

 
The system she worked with didn’t include any marketplace or rewards like "beauty boosts" or "superpowers." Its sole function was to motivate her to live each life meaningfully and actively complete tasks in different worlds. The system shielded her from becoming apathetic or detached—a “zen-like old soul” who felt indifferent to everything. As part of this, the system allowed her to temporarily block certain memories and experiences upon request.
 

 
Before entering the immersion pod, Tong Zhao chose to erase all memories of her multi-world journeys, resetting herself to the state she had been in before her mother passed away.
 

 
At that time, she hadn’t yet learned that her best friend was actually her half-sister, nor had she realized how swiftly she could fall from her privileged, sheltered life into the harsh reality of the world. Back then, she was still a well-protected young heiress.
 

 
About a third into the movie, the critics finally understood where the additional funding had gone.
 

 
After Sylia’s attempted suicide resulted in her mind regressing to that of a child, the entire world as seen through her eyes was enhanced with breathtaking, extremely expensive special effects! The sun smiled down at her, clouds had soft pink edges, and every brick, tile, plant, and blade of grass in the villa’s garden shimmered under a painterly, vividly saturated filter.
 

 
What’s more, Shi Qianqiu’s masterful touch ensured that none of it looked garish or cheap. The vibrant visuals, paired with Sylia’s innocent and joyful smiles, were absolutely mesmerizing!
 

 
It was as if two distinct worlds had been built on the same set of production codes.
 

 
Although the scope of the scenes wasn’t expansive, this technique...
 

 
It was classic Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
This technique, where the external scenery shifts along with the character's emotional changes, is more commonly seen in exaggerated animation. In live-action romance films without fantasy elements, it’s rare to employ such a method. However, this bold approach undeniably delivered a visual feast to the audience.
 

 
With Tong Zhao and Han Zhi already boasting top-tier looks, Shi Qianqiu’s lens elevated their beauty to almost unbearable levels.
 

 
‘Wow, if this movie becomes a hit, forget about Director Shi—this art director’s worth will skyrocket!’
 

 
Zhao Zai’s subconscious stubbornness altered the script yet again. The "childlike regression" didn’t lower her intelligence. She faintly sensed something suspicious about the male lead. However, Han Zhi was a grandmaster at deceiving both women and children. The push-and-pull dynamic between them sparked unique chemistry. By the middle of the film, Luo Yuanfeng had numbly accepted the reality that beneath Tong Zhao’s icy exterior lay a pure and tender soul.
 

 
It was astonishing. Although she had the appearance of a teenage girl, she was unmistakably just a child at heart.
 

 
And the male lead? He could still make a move?
 

 
‘Beast. Utter beast!’
 

 
In truth, apart from the initial whirlwind of kisses during his "test" of his girlfriend, Han Zhi’s most intimate actions afterward were limited to holding hands, hugging, or forehead kisses. There was no question of crossing the line. Yet, somehow, the live audience had unconsciously unified as overprotective "dad fans."
 

 
For a doting father, even a stranger glancing at his precious daughter was a sin!
 

 
‘Holding hands? Chop that paw off!’
 

 
---
 

 
During the backstage shoot, the crew closely monitored Zhao Zai’s psychological activity. When they noticed she had caught onto something suspicious about the male lead Nie Su, they were prepared to intervene and adjust the plot. After all, in the original script, Sylia remained completely oblivious until she regained her memories, at which point Nie Su confessed the truth, having been moved by her.
 

 
But what do you do when the heroine is too perceptive and figures out the male lead is a scumbag liar ahead of schedule?
 

 
Zhao Zai was too sharp!
 

 
However, Han Zhi, another facet of Tong Zhao’s personality, was equally formidable.
 

 
He withstood Zhao Zai’s growing suspicions and managed to explain away one inconsistency after another. While he admitted he had been hiding something, he assured her:
 

 
"I promise you, whatever I’m concealing is not meant to hurt you."
 

 
From Zhao Zai's perspective, the little bridge and flowing water in the villa's garden not only had water, but also a shimmering galaxy. Han Zhi’s character, Nie Su, gazed at her seriously, his eyes full of deep affection and inescapable melancholy. He had truly fallen for her, but the reality was that his girlfriend’s mental state had regressed to that of a child due to her refusal to grow up, and the cruel fact that their family backgrounds were worlds apart.
 

 
The reason behind the heroine’s mental regression, apart from the trauma from her suicide, was also the emotional manipulation and moral coercion from her parents, which had caused her to break down.
 

 
Since she couldn’t have freedom, she would rather not have it at all.
 

 
It was not that her parents didn’t want to let her go, but that she didn’t want to grow up, didn’t want to leave the house. As long as she stood on the same side as her parents, staying as the obedient child who didn’t want to leave home, she wouldn’t hurt anyone, and she wouldn’t suffer anymore.
 

 
Nie Su wasn’t a real psychologist, but he was the person who understood Sylia better than anyone else in the world.
 

 
In their previous online relationship, there were many things Sylia couldn’t say to her parents, but she had confided in him, speaking very frankly. Nie Su had vaguely sensed her emotional struggles and was troubled about how to rekindle her desire for growth.
 

 
And Sylia, gazing at Nie Su, felt a faint blush rise on her cheeks.
 

 
The moon in the sky, influenced by her emotional change, turned from yellow to red in an instant and shyly hid behind the clouds.
 

 
While the male lead was still troubled about how to make her want to grow up…
 

 
Due to the awakening of her romantic feelings, she now had a slight desire to grow up.
 

 
As the subconscious influence of Tong Zhao altered the plot, Shi Qianqiu didn’t stop it—in fact, he welcomed the change.
 

 
Change it! Keep changing it!
 

 
Thus, although the male lead didn’t say it directly, it was essentially exposed ahead of time.
 

 
In the original script, in order to ignite the heroine’s desire for the outside world, Nie Su had idealized much of it. This led to the eventual confession where he revealed that the adult world wasn’t as great as it seemed and was full of bad people—he was one of them.
 

 
However, Han Zhi’s subconscious slowly began to share his true situation with the heroine.
 

 
Zhao Zai listened, realizing that her big brother had done a lot of bad things!
 

 
Han Zhi: "So if you keep being picky and refuse to eat your green peppers, but then eat a whole bag of candy every day, you'll end up like me—living by lying to people and getting cavities."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so shocked that she covered her cheek, which was aching slightly from her teeth.
 

 
Zhao Zai still liked her big brother a lot. She wanted to change him.
 

 
"I’m not going to listen to a little kid. You need to grow up quickly if you want to teach me a lesson."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and patted her head.
# Chapter110
Love is a complex emotion.
 

 
Adults often say, “What do kids know about love?” But in reality, many adults don’t truly understand what love is either. In English, there’s a term, ‘puppy love’, to describe this kind of innocent, naive affection—like puppies snuggling together, radiating pure sincerity without any impurities.
 

 
What is love, and why must we understand it?
 
How does one learn to love and to be loved? Is there a course or a major dedicated to the art of pursuing someone romantically?
 
When is it time to give up on love? How can one determine the value of persistence or know if they truly like someone, as opposed to just following others’ opinions that they *seem like a good match*?
 

 
Han Zhi scored major points in front of the female protagonist’s parents, making them fully believe that he was helping their daughter recover from her psychological issues.
 

 
But the truth? Han Zhi didn’t know a thing about it.
 

 
The script hadn’t provided him with any professional psychology expertise, nor did Han Zhi have any training in the field. Every day, under the guise of “treatment,” he taught the female protagonist all the practical knowledge a functioning adult needs to navigate society.
 

 
In a quiet underground library surrounded by wooden bookshelves, the shelves were filled with the Shi family’s private collection. However, starkly contrasting with the intellectual tomes were the brightly colored children’s books on the bottom two shelves. These were bought by her parents when Sylia was younger, positioned to match her height at the time. Even now, her parents still firmly believed she should be reading these books.
 

 
Dressed in a white floral dress, Sylia slumped ungracefully over the desk and lazily lifted her gaze toward Nie Su. “Big Brother Nie, what are we learning today?”
 

 
Nie Su placed his laptop on the desk and opened a document.
 

 
The document’s title read: “100 Ways to Teach the Mentally Inept How to Live.”
 

 
Sylia’s sharp eyes caught the title and asked curiously, “What does ‘mentally inept’ mean?”
 

 
“A low-energy lifestyle,” Nie Su explained with a straight face, “is just another name for the trendy low-carbon lifestyle.” He added, “Don’t mention this term in front of your dad.”
 

 
“That means it’s a bad word,” Sylia declared confidently.
 

 
“You’re the hardest kid I’ve ever had to fool.”
 

 
“Really? Even compared to when you were a kid, Brother Nie?”
 

 
“Almost,” Nie Su admitted, pulling up the day’s lesson plan. “Because when I was a kid, I was the one fooling others.”
 

 
Sylia’s round almond eyes widened in shock at this revelation.
 

 
The camera zoomed in, revealing the day’s topics on Nie Su’s screen:
 

 
- How to Find a Suitable Job? (Subtopics: Avoiding MLM scams, workplace manipulation, and exploitative environments)
 
- How to Make New Friends? (Subtopics: Identifying malicious intentions in fake friends)
 
- How to Avoid Saying the Wrong Thing
 
- The Dynamics of Mutual Exploitation in Relationships
 
- How to Reject Pursuers (Highlighted and in bold!!!)
 

 
…
 

 
The audience quickly realized that aside from the suspicious self-interest in the last topic, the rest were essential life lessons. These were things schools never teach but that everyone is expected to know as soon as they step into the real world.
 

 
Though Sylia had never attended a formal school, she was taught by private tutors from a young age. Her academic knowledge matched that of a typical college student, but it ended there. Her parents, fearful that too much education might make her want to leave home, limited her learning—but couldn’t bear to leave her entirely uneducated.
 

 
Sylia tilted her head in doubt. “What’s the point of learning all this?”
 

 
“Every adult needs to know these things,” Nie Su replied with a faintly mocking smile on his otherwise composed face. “Schools teach you math, languages, and science. Your family teaches you morality and values. But when you enter society, all you’ll face are scams, cons, lies, and traps. Those without strong minds end up addicted to gambling, drugs, and other vices.”
 

 
The phrasing of this line—short, snappy, and full of rhythm—drew laughs from the audience. But after the laughter, many found themselves reflecting: wasn’t there a grain of truth in his words?
 

 
Nie Su laid bare the cruel and harsh realities of society for Sylia, teaching her about the darker aspects of life.
 

 
Yet, in contrast to his scheming and jaded worldview, Sylia was like a pure little angel untouched by the world’s corruption. Through these lessons, she unintentionally offered him a new perspective. While the characters had the physical forms of mature adults, the audience couldn’t help but see them as two adorable, innocent children rolling around on a grassy field—endearingly sweet and heartwarming.
 

 
Although she knew she couldn’t enjoy whirlwind kisses forever without growing up, the pure-hearted Sylia thought these days weren’t bad at all.
 

 
As long as Brother Nie was by her side, the outside world didn’t seem so tempting anymore.
 

 
---
 

 
During the filming of this segment, the writers’ team became quite anxious.
 

 
The climax of ‘Neverland Girl’ was supposed to involve the male protagonist confessing to the female lead that he was a liar—a bad person.
 

 
But now? A villain?
 

 
The female lead had already figured that out and was even trying to reform him. On top of that, the male lead seemed nearly reformed already.
 

 
At this rate, the story was heading straight for a happily-ever-after ending, skipping the drama entirely.
 

 
A happily-ever-after ending is nice, but it can sometimes feel lacking in drama, leaving the story less grand and impactful. Most creators share the same dilemma: readers wish for the protagonists to live happily ever after, perhaps even getting married and enjoying lifelong bliss. Meanwhile, the author muses, “Should I throw in a natural disaster or a human tragedy first?”—to heighten the pacing and dramatic tension.
 

 
The screenwriters were worried, but Shi Qianqiu, the director, remained calm.
 

 
He trusted Tong Zhao's subconscious meddling abilities, especially her male alter-ego named "Han Zhi," who excelled at stirring things up in matters of love.
 

 
And sure enough—
 

 
Nie Su, played by Han Zhi, discovered that Sylia had fallen in love with him once again. She still didn’t want to grow up, but this time, it wasn’t out of pain or self-loathing. Instead, it stemmed from sweet happiness, a desire to remain in this blissful state. Adding to the tension, Shi’s parents had begun to notice the sparks between the two. Shi’s father made a bold proposal: he offered a high salary to essentially “buy” Nie Su’s life, on the condition that Nie Su stayed with their daughter, never leaving, and guarding their home forever.
 

 
As long as their daughter was happy and stayed within the safe and warm confines of the house, the parents were willing to make any compromise.
 

 
Of course, children moving out for work and returning home for meals and rest is perfectly normal. In the Shi family’s case, with their immense wealth, even living with her parents after marriage wouldn’t be an issue. As the most level-headed character in the entire film, Nie Su understood that the parents, too, had psychological issues. However, their actions—though flawed—were rooted in love and would never harm their daughter.
 

 
In a society under such high pressure, who doesn’t carry a few mental scars?
 

 
Nie Su left behind a recording and quit his job, disappearing from their lives.
 

 
---
 

 
The Recording:
 
“I know you’ve been reading romance novels recently. Some male protagonists tell their heroines that as long as they’re around, the heroine can remain a child forever. I might not be someone capable of offering that kind of promise. Your parents, on the other hand, probably can.
 

 
But I believe that only by becoming an adult first can one have the privilege of choosing to act like a child in front of someone special.”
 

 
“This is the last lesson I’ll teach you, kid.”
 

 
“When you grow up… you’ll find that some relationships don’t end with arguments or betrayals. Sometimes, they end simply because two people choose different paths. When the final goodbye arrives, it’s often without warning. Later, when you think back on it, you’ll wish you had known it was the last meeting—so you could hug that person tightly.”
 

 
Nie Su let out a soft laugh—a gentle, warm sound. Even the distortion of the old tape recorder couldn’t obscure his exceptional voice.
 

 
“Not wanting to grow up isn’t wrong. The adult world isn’t that great, after all.
 

 
But I refuse to be the reason you develop a new kind of illness.”
 

 
“I’m a failed adult. There’s only so much I can teach you. If, in the future, you come to new realizations and insights, trust yourself. Don’t doubt your judgment. I believe you’ll grow into an adult who’s a thousand times better than I ever was.”
 

 
“Kid, I really like you.”
 

 
“But the one I love is Sylia.”
 

 
---
 

 
At this point, the director seamlessly tied all the narrative threads together:
 

 
From the very beginning, Nie Su had loved Sylia. Their relationship had started as an online romance, despite having never met in person. It was this love that prevented him from committing greater crimes. He gave up his "pig butchering scam" schemes for wealth, sought her out when she vanished from his life, and helped her resolve her emotional burdens.
 

 
Because of his exceptional emotional intelligence, Nie Su realized that his presence made it easier for Sylia to cope with her struggles. Yet he also knew that deep down, she still wanted to grow up.
 

 
This wasn’t about money. The innate curiosity and desire to explore the unknown are fundamental instincts of childhood.
 

 
Sylia burst into tears. After crying her heart out, she wiped her eyes and prepared to chase after him.
 

 
Nie Su’s guess was correct. Sylia indeed resolved her inner struggles because of him. She stood her ground before her parents, promising she would always come home early, and even if she stayed out all night, she would inform them where she was staying.
 

 
With her parents' support, Sylia began to take on the family business while searching for Nie Su.
 

 
In the closing scenes of the film, traces of the Shi parents’ overprotectiveness remained. For example, if Sylia had to go on a week-long business trip and her aging parents couldn’t physically accompany her, they would rent out the entire hotel where she stayed to ensure no dangerous individuals could book nearby rooms. This kind of extravagant behavior exasperated Sylia, who turned the resourcefulness to her advantage by hosting her business partners at the hotel.
 

 
Every piece of practical advice Nie Su had taught her about surviving adulthood came in handy.
 

 
But she couldn’t find Nie Su.
 

 
Now free to live her life, Sylia developed a deep passion for learning. Every quarter, she hired a private tutor to teach her a new skill three times a week during her free time from work. This might include cooking French cuisine, driving, flower arranging, tea ceremonies, electrical work, or painting—anything that seemed like a worthwhile craft. Anyone who thought they could teach the heiress a useful skill was welcome to apply.
 

 
However, the job posting included one peculiar, non-mandatory requirement:
 

 
“Preference will be given to candidates with the surname Nie.”
 

 
Sylia knew he would understand. As long as this job posting remained, it was her way of telling him that he would always hold the top priority in her heart.
 

 
Meanwhile, after repaying his debts and finding his footing in life, Nie Su finally appeared late one night in front of the towering Shi Corporation building after an exhausting overtime shift.
 

 
This time, when they met again, they were both weary yet hopeful adults, each with a clear direction in life.

As the film came to an end, thunderous applause erupted.
 

 
Since this was a preview screening, the audience consisted of movie enthusiasts and seasoned viewers. They had quietly endured the film up until this moment, and now their pent-up excitement poured forth in an explosion of commentary:
 

 
“I never thought Tong Zhao’s portrayal of romance could be this moving.”
 

 
“I think it’s thanks to the male lead. His emotions were expressed with such subtlety.”
 

 
“True, you can’t deny that. His controversial past made his character more layered and complex. In comparison, Tong Zhao’s character felt a bit simpler. But her performance as Sylia deserves a perfect score—can anyone explain to me how she managed to embody the psyche of a child without making it seem unnatural!?”
 

 
Amidst the heated debate over whether the male or female lead performed better, someone tentatively chimed in:
 

 
“Uh… you do realize the male lead was also played by Tong Zhao, right?”
 

 
This revelation brought an abrupt hush to the once-lively discussion.
 

 
Tong Zhao was like an exquisite, multifaceted wine. Poured into different vessels, she could reflect an array of dazzling lights.
 

 
The only constant across all her portrayals was that she always shone so brilliantly.
# Chapter111
After a brief silence, the screening hall buzzed with activity.
 

 
As the lights in the hall brightened, a few staff members entered, and in their midst, smiling warmly, was the movie's leading actress, Tong Zhao. Her appearance was greeted with another wave of applause. When she picked up a wireless microphone and smiled at the audience, the applause gradually subsided.
 

 
“Hello, everyone. Did you enjoy the movie?”
 

 
The audience responded with unanimous cheers and applause. Tong Zhao graciously expressed her gratitude as the lead actress, then transitioned into the Q&A segment.
 

 
Once given permission to record, the invited reporters eagerly raised their cameras, trying to capture both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu in the frame. The two had been the subject of rumors ever since their private meeting a while back.
 

 
Though that gossip had faded over time, the release of ‘Neverland Girl’ had inevitably brought them back into the spotlight.
 

 
Young, attractive, and undeniably wealthy, collaborating on a film together—it was an irresistible story for the media. Even without chasing scandalous headlines, positive coverage of these two was already a huge draw.
 

 
If they were truly dating, there seemed little reason to keep it under wraps. Tong Zhao’s PR team had always been skilled, and she wasn’t reliant on a fan base enamored with her single status. Unless, of course, theirs was a more casual relationship with no intention of commitment. After all, in their industry, such casual arrangements were not uncommon given the long periods of separation.
 

 
Serious relationships required one party to compromise significantly, and most romances in the entertainment world often unraveled due to clashing schedules. A quiet breakup would be considered a best-case scenario.
 

 
Publicizing a relationship, only to break up in two or three months? That would be damaging to their public image.
 

 
Ending things privately and then announcing the split six months later might work, but if someone caved to their biological urges in the meantime and was caught by paparazzi, it would result in a public outcry. The “cheater” would face backlash, while the “betrayed” party would garner sympathy but risk damaging their high-end image.
 

 
Thus, unless caught red-handed or overwhelmed by their emotions, most celebrities would insist they were just “friends” while dating a fellow entertainer. If the relationship stabilized, they could always go public later.
 

 
After some wandering thoughts, the reporters resigned themselves to the conclusion that unless there was undeniable evidence, these two would never publicly confirm a relationship. The dream of a breaking news story was dashed, but the cameras kept snapping away, aiming for any interactions or glances shared between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, the internet loved this kind of content.
 

 
“Is it true that what initially attracted you to ‘Neverland Girl’ was the script?”
 

 
“Yes,” Tong Zhao nodded with a smile. “I found it to be a captivating love story that balances entertainment and depth, and the roles really allowed me to showcase my strengths.”
 

 
...Well.
 

 
The critics who had confidently claimed that Tong Zhao wasn’t suited for romance films must’ve been feeling the sting now.
 

 
Their embarrassment was palpable yet impossible to deny. The film’s quality spoke for itself; there was no point in pretending otherwise.
 

 
“Is there any role that ‘isn’t’ suited for you? Probably not!”
 

 
The atmosphere at the screening was relaxed, and a well-known critic joked loudly.
 

 
The crowd erupted in laughter, with many chiming in agreement.
 

 
Half of the crowd genuinely believed that there wasn’t a role Tong Zhao couldn’t master.
 

 
The other half, who had previously doubted her, now shamelessly joined her fanbase, pretending nothing had ever happened.
 

 
“Actually, there are some roles I probably couldn’t pull off,” Tong Zhao admitted candidly. “For instance, my subconscious likely wouldn’t suit playing a submissive character—unless it’s due to external pressures, and there’s a redemption arc later. Otherwise, I’d probably break character.”
 

 
Hearing this, the audience realized she might be right. Tong Zhao had never played a submissive role.
 

 
In the era of instinctive films, it wasn’t unusual for actors to have roles they couldn’t tackle. Forcing them to diversify beyond their abilities often led to more harm than good. Some critics even nodded in agreement, whispering to their neighbors, “If Tong Zhao could settle down and focus on similar roles, it’d be great.”
 

 
Due to spoiler restrictions, some topics in the Q&A session were off-limits.
 

 
When the conversation touched on plot-related questions, they couldn’t go into too much detail. However, someone asked Shi Qianqiu, “Toward the end of the movie, we were all holding our breath! Director Shi, you’ve always had faith in Tong Zhao’s subconscious ability to handle adversity, but were you ever worried?”
 

 
“Oh, absolutely. And my worries came true,” Shi Qianqiu replied, furrowing his brows, his expression heavy with thought.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s good looks amplified the audience’s empathy. Could Tong Zhao have really fallen short in some way? The crowd leaned in eagerly.
 

 
“The script’s ending was open-ended, entirely dependent on how the protagonists’ subconscious performed. That’s a hallmark of instinctive romance films,” Shi explained. “But I was hoping for a more realistic conclusion...”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao, who knew Shi Qianqiu all too well, gave him a look of mild disdain.
 

 
Her gaze practically screamed ‘disapproval’.
 

 
The reporters perked up with excitement.
 

 
—Could there be tension between the lead actress and the director?
 

 
Using his wistful, intellectual tone, Shi Qianqiu elaborated on his ideal ending: “I envisioned Sylia fully integrating into this utilitarian world, treating her first love as a fond memory. She’d go from being the princess of Neverland to the queen of a business empire. Meanwhile, after repaying his debts, Nie Su joins a grueling 996 company, which turns out to be owned by Shi’s family. He ultimately dies from overwork due to continuous overtime. In a way, he sacrifices his life for his first love. I even planned out how this scene would be edited—his commercial value would perfectly match the worth of one tiny diamond on the tiara Sylia wears at her billion-dollar wedding.”
 

 
...
 

 
The room fell into an awkward silence.
 

 
Tong Zhao broke it with a sharp quip: “I think the first thing that should be cut is your commentary.”
 

 
“No way,” Shi Qianqiu retorted.
 

 
True to his reputation as a master of rebuttal, Shi Qianqiu clung to the microphone with determination. “I actually had a lot of ideas. When refining the script, I dug plenty of metaphorical holes for the leads—probably three major ones. After the public release, interested viewers are welcome to explore them.”
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu took over, the task of refining the script for ‘Neverland Girl’ fell entirely to him.
 

 
Writing scripts for holographic films was unlike traditional methods—it involved elements of programming. The more refined the script, the larger the workload, akin to creating a highly interactive ‘Galgame’. Shi Qianqiu’s apparent lack of interest in giving the leads a happy ending irked some critics who had become protective “dad fans” of Tong Zhao’s character.
 

 
“Don’t worry,” Shi Qianqiu reassured, smiling charmingly. “When it comes to digging holes, I’m a professional. Even if the protagonists fall into them, it won’t detract from the story’s brilliance. It just means the brilliance will take on a slightly different direction.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Hmm, to avoid reshooting and burning through our limited budget, my subconscious really gave it its all.”
 

 
The screening room erupted into laughter.
 

 
Because of the budget constraints, someone naturally asked about where the additional funding had been spent. This led to a discussion of another highlight of the film: after the female protagonist develops a psychological condition, everything around her takes on a dreamlike, fairy-tale quality. Flowers gently sway in sync with her joyful emotions, and when she hides under her blanket, it transforms into a secret base, complete with a tiny hanging lamp.
 

 
These visual wonders were a testament to the director's team and the art director's aesthetic vision and creativity.
 

 
With visuals like these, it seemed inevitable the film would secure a Best Visual Effects award.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known for his willingness to spend generously, wasn’t using his own money this time. Thankfully, the investors trusted him and were willing to inject additional funds despite widespread skepticism at the time. Upon reflection, some critics realized that the investor was none other than Zeshan, the company helmed by Tong Zhao herself. Of course, she trusted her own judgment! In the entertainment industry, few could match Tong Zhao's confidence.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu commented, “This adjustment was Tong Zhao’s idea. I merely brought her vision to life.”
 

 
Suddenly, all eyes turned to Tong Zhao with newfound admiration.
 

 
What a talent—not only excelling in acting but also demonstrating sharp business acumen.
 

 
Everything she invested in seemed to succeed, and even a casual suggestion turned out to be a major highlight of the movie.
 

 
Most of the audience were savvy individuals.
 

 
At least, they were knowledgeable about instinctive films. They quickly recognized that ‘Neverland Girl’ had initially been a more artistic, low-budget project with minimal sets. Typically, even if the storyline was excellent and critically acclaimed, viewers would likely opt for the cheaper, traditional viewing format. This significantly reduced its appeal.
 

 
That’s why so many art films with box-office ambitions laboriously crammed in visual effects to boost their draw.
 

 
However, many such attempts felt forced, resulting in a disjointed mess. Tong Zhao’s idea, on the other hand, fit perfectly. Her suggestion might even open up a lucrative new direction for romantic films in the instinctive cinema genre. A whimsical fairy-tale romance that could explore deeper themes, much like Shi Qianqiu’s darker, grittier take beneath the fairy-tale veneer.
 

 
As Zeshan continued to expand, some critics who understood films admitted they were less informed about the business world.
 

 
Just how vast was the financial backing behind Tong Zhao?
 

 
Was ‘Neverland Girl’ merely a one-off experiment born out of necessity—when there was a great script but no suitable team—or was it a stepping stone for Tong Zhao’s evolution from actress to producer?
 

 
Eyes filled with curiosity and contemplation landed on Tong Zhao. What truly intrigued them now wasn’t just her beauty but how much further she could go in her career.
 

 
“I only came up with an idea,” Tong Zhao humbly clarified. “The hard work of turning my idea into a reality on screen was thanks to the director’s team and the art department. All the stunning visuals you see in the film are the result of their tireless efforts, painstakingly crafted from scratch. If credit is to be given, I’d say my contribution is worth one-tenth, at most.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t claim credit.
 

 
At the time, her motivation was simple: since “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of her) rarely had the chance to experience holographic filmmaking, she wanted her to have fun with it. Filming such projects felt a bit like living through a multidimensional travel adventure, and the aftereffects were profound. Tong Zhao’s suggestions were purely indulgent, fulfilling the childlike dreams of her subconscious self.
 

 
These were wild childhood fantasies she had long forgotten.
 

 
While the idea was brilliant, its success wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of the crew.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s exceptional aesthetic sense crafted a beautiful dream for “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of Tong Zhao).
 

 
With her "inner child" receiving such care, Tong Zhao found herself looking at Shi Qianqiu more favorably.
 

 
And Shi Qianqiu? He found her just as agreeable, eager to lock down their next collaboration, where he could plot new challenges for her to tackle.
 

 
---
 

 
The buzz about ‘Neverland Girl’ receiving critical acclaim quickly spread throughout the industry.
 

 
The art director’s reputation skyrocketed, and Shi Qianqiu—already known as a box office magnet—only solidified his legendary status. The additional accolades simply added more brilliance to the crown he wore with nonchalance.
 

 
Critics were raving:
 

 
- “A romantic visual spectacle, crafted by the most enchanting subconscious mind, creating this winter’s most poignant love story.”
 
- “A fairy tale for adults! Shi Qianqiu—the man who best understands how to tap into Tong Zhao’s subconscious charm.”
 
- “If only Han Zhi, the fictional male lead, really existed!”
 
- “Tong Zhao, I’m your dad!”
 

 
Aside from the last headline—a dramatic outburst from an overzealous fan critic—the reviews from those who attended the screening read as though they’d all been paid to shower the film with praise.
 

 
This stirred online debate: Was it an expensive PR stunt, or was the movie truly that good?
 

 
Of course, there were some more neutral takes:
 

 
- “The exaggerated character setups make it difficult for the film to deeply explore its intended themes. It barely scratches the surface, but it’s still an excellent romance movie.”
 
- “I don’t think this film deserves any plot-related awards, but it absolutely deserves a nomination for its visual effects.”
 
- “The entire movie leans on the charisma of the male and female leads’ subconscious minds.”
 

 
Overall, the praise outweighed the criticism.
 

 
The initial skepticism online about Tong Zhao playing two roles simultaneously vanished as if it had never existed. Instead, several critics lamented on social media and in their columns that no young actor in real life could match the allure of Han Zhi, the fictional male lead. "If only someone like him were real," they sighed.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu’s masterful promotional strategy, the film’s marketing campaign was in full swing. It successfully brought Tong Zhao, who had deliberately reduced her public appearances recently, back into the spotlight.
 

 
However, the tactics used weren’t exactly conventional.
 

 
At the screening, reporters carefully selected a set of photos where the two appeared together and shared them in the news. When compiled, these photos told a story that caught everyone’s attention:
 

 
When Tong Zhao spoke with a microphone in hand, Shi Qianqiu was watching her intently. And when Shi Qianqiu, known for his mischievous comments, made his usual offbeat remarks, the usually composed Tong Zhao shot him a sideways glance—playful, teasing, and filled with a familiarity that spoke volumes.
 

 
Her beautiful, expressive eyes met his, revealing a connection outsiders couldn’t penetrate.
 

 
This was love, plain and simple!
 

 
The invited reporters, to their credit, didn’t sensationalize the photos. Instead, they subtly hinted at the exchange of glances between the two, encouraging netizens to comment and share their interpretations.
 

 
The buzz was nothing to be ashamed of.
 

 
Before the fans had time to get heartbroken, the company quickly issued an official statement, clarifying the previous secret meeting and explaining that they had met to discuss a movie collaboration, with no romantic intentions between the two at the moment.
 

 
The discussion among netizens was lively, with the scandal trending on social media, inevitably bringing up their collaborative movie.
 

 
Back and forth, this also saved a small chunk of the budget.
 

 
[I'm so anxious! Why hasn't it been released yet? The version shown at the screening was the edited one, right? I’m bound by a non-disclosure agreement, but I just want to see it now!]
 

 
[Someone, please knock me out with a punch so that when I wake up, I can watch ‘Neverland Girl’! qaq]
 

 
[Stop talking about it, the trailer's out! Everyone, hurry and go watch it! Check the homepage of the movie theater! Go watch it now!]
 

 
A week before the release, the carefully crafted trailer, riding on this wave of publicity, entered the sight of countless netizens.
# Chapter112
"I don't want to grow up."
 

 
"Then always be our little one. Stay with us and never leave."
 

 
The trailer begins with young Zhao curled up on her mother’s lap. Soft golden light from the setting sun filters through the window, enveloping the mother and daughter in a warm glow. Little Zhao's chubby, porcelain-like cheeks look as though they're draped in a layer of golden gauze, her bright, almond-shaped eyes reflecting crescent-shaped highlights.
 

 
The child version of Tong Zhao is one of the movie’s promotional highlights. Though her appearances in the film are brief, the trailer generously showcases her adorable moments. Usually, such childhood roles are portrayed by child actors, but even without promotional material, the familiar almond-shaped eyes, delicate features, and expressive brows make it clear—this is Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Who could have imagined young Tong Zhao would be this cute?
 

 
Is such an adorable child even real?
 

 
Miniature Tong Zhao looks like a meticulously crafted BJD doll, with her long, thick eyelashes framing her clear, bright eyes. Her slightly chubby cheeks, arms, and legs hint at a well-fed childhood, giving her a soft, clumsy charm.
 

 
Comment sections erupted, claiming these childhood scenes might be the only time audiences will see Tong Zhao with even a hint of baby fat—after all, she’s famous for her disciplined physique.
 

 
[I always imagined young Tong Zhao as a cold, noble young lady… Turns out she was this adorable? Rolling onto the play mat and tumbling over herself? I’m melting!]
 

 
[One of life’s great mysteries: How could that scumbag dad bear to hurt this angel of a child?]
 

 
[The scumbag dad can rot! From now on, we are all officially Tong Zhao's dad fans!]
 

 
[Your announcement is officially approved.]
 

 
The scene shifts to an exchange of messages between the male and female leads. When the camera focuses on Tong Zhao, the soundtrack features lighthearted piano notes, perfectly timed with each line of dialogue. However, when the focus shifts to Han Zhi, the music changes to deeper, more somber drum beats.
 

 
In visual storytelling, background music is an integral part of conveying emotion and narrative information.
 

 
On one side is unreserved sincerity, and on the other is a calculated probe cloaked in mystery.
 

 
—Is this the classic "bad boy and princess" trope?
 

 
The trailer’s editing subtly plants this idea in the audience's mind.
 

 
In the preview, Han Zhi sheds his usual refined style of button-ups, casual suits, and trench coats. Instead, his entrance features a trendy, rebellious outfit. His black hair, styled with a light mist of setting spray, is slightly tousled for an effortlessly cool look, with a strand of fringe falling over his left eye to accentuate his face shape. Whoever styled this deserves applause—they managed to transform a suave man in his late twenties into a smoldering “boy-next-door” in his early twenties. His playful smirk at the computer screen has female viewers collectively swooning.
 

 
"Damn, just for this look, I ‘have’ to see this in theaters!"
 

 
The trailer swiftly transitions into a montage explaining the plot's twist—accidental amnesia.
 

 
The heavy beats of a drum accompany a job posting seeking medical help as it spreads online. A mouse clicks, and the next scene reveals Han Zhi presenting himself formally to the female lead's parents. He's wearing silver-rimmed glasses, exuding a dependable yet subtly roguish charm—a "cultured bad boy" persona.
 

 
It’s a look audiences are familiar with, but the vibe is entirely different this time.
 
It’s mischievous. It’s magnetic.
 

 
—"You don’t remember me?"
 

 
—"I think I’ve dreamed of you… but it feels like I’m always dreaming now."
 

 
—"What’s your dream like?"
 

 
As Han Zhi gazes at Tong Zhao, the question drops. The camera zooms sharply into her clear, bright eyes, then quickly pans out to reveal a whimsical, dreamlike mansion, setting a surreal and magical tone.
 

 
"What’s it like to pamper your girlfriend into being a child?"
 
"I didn’t spoil her like this, thanks."
 

 
Though the white text claims, "I didn’t spoil her," the clips contradict him. Han Zhi is shown peeling an orange for her, adjusting her inner sleeve after helping her into her jacket, and more.
 

 
—"I’m not dating a bratty kid."
 

 
The music abruptly stops as Han Zhi twirls an automatic pencil between his fingers and lightly taps Tong Zhao on the forehead. Startled, she instinctively covers her head like a flustered little hamster, perfectly mirroring the earlier scene where young Zhao does the same. The identical expressions cleverly reinforce the "soul reverting to childhood" premise.
 

 
With a childlike mind, Tong Zhao forgets her online romance with Han Zhi but feels a strange sense of warmth and reliance on him. Often, she wonders who he really is. In essence, she falls for him all over again as a child—classic romance storytelling where, no matter the identity or timeline, love always finds a way.
 

 
Following a crescendo of fast-paced drum beats, two lines of text appear on screen:
 

 
"I never thought I'd become the reason a brat doesn't want to grow up."
 

 
As the final drumbeat fades, a recording plays the line, "But the one I love is Sylia." Tong Zhao clenches the recorder in her hand, rises, and rushes out to stop him from leaving.
 

 
The dreamlike mansion splits along the line of her body, transitioning back to its original, ordinary appearance.
 

 
Piece by piece, the fairytale dissolves into reality.
 

 
The female lead regains her memories.
 

 
The dream ends.
 

 
And the boy’s departure becomes the catalyst for the once-little girl who wanted to stay in "Neverland" forever to finally grow up.
 

 
The trailer didn’t reveal the ending.
 

 
Would the two protagonists reunite?
 

 
This question sparked heated debates in the comments section. Supporters of a happy ending argued persuasively that romance films no longer rely on tragic conclusions to draw tears; feel-good, happily-ever-after endings are now the norm.
 

 
On the other hand, proponents of a tragic ending also had a solid case:
 

 
[The director is Shi Qianqiu!]
 

 
Shi, nicknamed “Old Trickster,” is infamous for crafting stories that leave audiences bawling their eyes out—then allegedly hiding under a blanket to chuckle at their misery.
 

 
Of course, no one has actually witnessed him laughing under a blanket, but countless viewers traumatized by his previous works are firmly convinced of this legend.
 

 
The trailer was beautifully shot, exceeding all expectations. Combined with the breathtaking visuals of the lead actors, the comments section was flooded not just with plot discussions but also with girls tagging their boyfriends, dropping hints about wanting to watch it together.
 

 
The trailer’s share count stood out, thanks largely to Han Zhi’s fans driving up the numbers.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always discouraged her fans from becoming “data laborers.” She once posted on Weibo, asking them not to do this because it wasn’t necessary. She emphasized that there are many ways to express one’s support. While generating data isn’t illegal and doesn’t seem to harm anyone (aside from putting stress on Sina’s servers), she values her fans’ time and doesn’t want them wasting it on meaningless tasks.
 

 
Her stance has led to her having relatively “modest” data compared to her popularity. However, when it comes to "dehydrated" (authentic) engagement metrics, her numbers are consistently impressive—a fact widely recognized within the industry.
 

 
Interestingly, Han Zhi’s fans are usually laid-back and don’t engage in data wars either.
 

 
So why the exception this time?
 

 
—This was Han Zhi’s long-anticipated debut in a film!
 

 
Hints about his involvement had appeared during his previous live streams, though fans didn’t think he’d take on an acting role. They assumed it was related to Tong Zhao’s work, perhaps as a behind-the-scenes contribution. When word spread within the industry that Han Zhi would play the male lead, even notable film critics were skeptical.
 

 
But the trial screening turned out to be a surprising success!
 

 
When the trailer was released, it caused an uproar.
 

 
Fans treated it like a festive group activity, happily rallying together.
 

 
Once in a while, breaking their usual chill wasn’t embarrassing at all.
 

 
Many fans also wanted to make sure the company knew that Han Zhi still had active supporters. If opportunities like this arose again, they hoped their “Gege” would be considered. The shares were filled with heartfelt confessions:
 

 
[I’m so touched. Turns out the company hasn’t forgotten about Han Zhi.]
 

 
[Shoutout to my Brother—this self-love dynamic in the film is just chef’s kiss!]
 

 
[Self-love duo confirmed real (szd)]
 

 
[Han Zhi's new look—I’m in love! So youthful! Can this model be used in his livestreams? Someone write a petition for the wolf-boy version of Han Zhi!]
 

 
[Count me in for the petition. +1]
 

 
Since Han Zhi and Tong Zhao are essentially the same person, there’s no room for a real “couple” dynamic, which allows his girlfriend fans to swoon without any guilt.
 

 
The concept of one actor playing both male and female leads has been a trending topic, staying in the top six on social media for an extended period.
 

 
After all, it’s a first in the era of fully virtual films.
 

 
This level of buzz has other movies competing for attention turning green with envy. The movie has hit the ground running with immense popularity, and the related topics are flooded with praise. Fans debate whether Han Zhi and Tong Zhao have better chemistry or if it’s Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, reviving old rumors about the actress and director.
 

 
Don’t ask—when in doubt, ‘all ships are welcome in the harem’.
 

 
Other production teams have been tempted to replicate the success story of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
But then they look at their directors’ faces…
 

 
Appearance is secondary. Most directors working on rival projects are already married with families. Any rumored entanglements with the lead actors would become scandals rather than buzz-worthy gossip. Lacking similar ingredients, they can only grit their teeth and grumble that Shi Qianqiu is shameless for creating hype by fueling relationship rumors.
 

 
That same day, Jiang Dang posted a short video on Weibo:
 

 
@JiangDangV:
 

 
‘Singing a song.’
 

 
[Video]
 

 
In the video, Jiang Dang plays a guitar and performs a seamless medley of three songs: ‘Obsession’, ‘I’m Fine’, and ‘Always So Quiet’. The selected lyrics include:
 

 
“My feelings for you are more than mere obsession.”
 
“I’m fine—after all, I’ve only ever been needed occasionally.”
 
“I’m fine—even in the cold, I only trust my coat.”
 
“It’s clearly a movie for three, but I never had a name.”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s raspy low voice delivered the melancholy lyrics as if he had experienced heartbreak a thousand times over.
 

 
The comments section exploded with questions:
 

 
[Did you just get dumped?]
 

 
Jiang Dang replied to one fan:
 

 
[Right on time.]
 

 
Right on time for what?
 

 
A quick glance at the timestamp: exactly midnight.
 

 
So that’s it—he’s just indulging in some classic ‘NetEase Cloud Depression’.
 

 
Similarly brooding is the production team behind ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, a romance film releasing at nearly the same time as ‘Neverland Girl’ and with a suspiciously similar theme.
 

 
Romantic films primarily target young couples, who often only watch one romance movie during a short timeframe. Once their demand is met, they’re unlikely to choose another unless the reviews are exceptional. Most will opt for a different genre entirely.
 

 
The overlapping release dates have caused no small amount of anxiety.
 

 
The most frustrated of all is ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ screenwriter Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Zhang has been an old rival of Shi Qianqiu (though it’s a one-sided rivalry, as Shi doesn’t even remember who Zhang is). His grudge traces back to 'Heartless Tribulation’, a project that somehow also led him to harbor resentment toward Tong Zhao. In his frustration, Zhang once wrote a critique titled “Tong Zhao: A Distorted Product of Audiences’ Overvaluation of Subconscious Novelty in the Era of Virtual Films.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even acknowledge his critique, let alone respond. Instead, she went on to shoot another critically and commercially successful action film, which Zhang perceived as a direct slap in the face (though Tong Zhao initially considered it but eventually forgot).
 

 
In short, with the release dates of his movie clashing with those of his two sworn rivals, Zhang Wenshi felt a mix of unease and determination to stage a comeback.
 

 
Fortunately, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had a decent budget, allowing for a strong promotional campaign.
 

 
In comparison, the competing production seemed a bit more frugal.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi thought back to how Shi Qianqiu’s movies were always known for their lavish spending. This, in his mind, was the biggest difference between them (again, a one-sided perception). After all, he didn’t have the same privileged background to support extravagant projects. Seeing that the rival production seemed underfunded, Zhang felt this might be his one and only chance to outshine Shi Qianqiu, and he was determined to seize it.
 

 
And Tong Zhao—she was still the villain on his personal blacklist!
 

 
With ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ pouring its heart into promotions, time seemed to fly, and soon, the day of its release arrived. The movie’s distributor had fought hard to secure an earlier launch, reasoning that even a one-day head start could give them an edge. After all, viewers who had already watched ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ might not feel like heading to the theater for another romance film.
 

 
All movie critics, box office predictors, and curious onlookers had their eyes glued to this holiday release window!
# Chapter113
Zhang Wenshi had everything planned out.
 

 
"Sweet Rendezvous" was set to premiere on Saturday, while "Neverland Girl" would follow on Sunday.
 

 
It was typical for couples, after a long workweek, to go on dates during the weekend. Watching a movie was a standard choice, wasn’t it? And "Sweet Rendezvous’" had solid production quality. It was a safe, conventional romance film designed to make audiences laugh, cry, and feel moved in all the right places. With a loyal fan base for the lead actors, many viewers were eagerly anticipating its release.
 

 
The male lead, Gu Zhisuo, was among the top-tier young actors of the moment. Debuting with a "cool and rebellious" persona, his role as the young heir in "Sweet Rendezvous" aligned perfectly with his public image.
 

 
Most people assumed this film would elevate Gu Zhisuo’s popularity and market value. After all, not everyone was as daring and adventurous as Tong Zhao, who chose projects that matched her unpredictable subconscious preferences. Gu Zhisuo played it safe and followed the traditional path to success.
 

 
The investors were cautious, but the "Sweet Rendezvous’" team felt confident. For a romance movie, they had invested heavily in production. They even managed to secure a slightly earlier release date, squeezing in ahead of "Neverland Girl".
 

 
Interestingly, though, while Gu Zhisuo’s team had worked hard to secure that early release, the team behind "Neverland Girl" seemed unbothered. Given Director Shi Qianqiu’s strong connections, not to mention his brother—a powerful and protective businessman—it would have been easy for them to push back. But instead, there was only silence.
 

 
Was it a lack of funds or sheer confidence?
 

 
Gu Zhisuo leaned toward the former.
 

 
When "Neverland Girl" was in its initial stages, Gu Zhisuo’s manager had reached out, expressing interest in the project. However, the producers implied that his asking price was too high. They didn’t explicitly say it, of course—such blunt negotiations could bruise egos—but the message was clear to anyone experienced in the industry. When Gu Zhisuo caught wind of this, he immediately lost interest.
 

 
Romance movies were a gamble when it came to box office success. "Neverland Girl" wasn’t some high-profile project aiming for awards—it was a small, scrappy production. His initial interest stemmed from Tong Zhao’s reputation for delivering box office hits, but not enough to lower his fee. Conveniently, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ offered a solid paycheck, so he took it instead. Given the overlapping release dates, he kept a casual eye on "Neverland Girl."
 

 
When he heard that the other production had received additional funding, he couldn’t help feeling slightly annoyed.
 

 
So they ‘did’ have the money—they just thought he wasn’t worth it?
 

 
Still, "Neverland Girl" had turned him down politely, and Gu Zhisuo wasn’t the type to hold a grudge over a missed deal. He had no intention of sabotaging their production.
 

 
However, hearing about ‘Neverland Girl’ additional funding stirred something in Gu Zhisuo. It wasn't outright anger, but more like a small thorn in his pride. Clearly, the issue wasn’t their inability to pay—it was that they didn’t think he was worth his fee.
 

 
Still, professionalism reigned. Gu Zhisuo had a solid reputation and wasn’t the type to stoop to petty antics over a declined offer. Instead, his focus remained on ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. With its superior budget, polished production, and early release, it seemed poised for success.
 

 
But curiosity lingered. ‘Neverland Girl’ had been quietly moving forward, and its lack of a flashy promotional campaign made it somewhat of an enigma. Gu Zhisuo couldn’t help but monitor its progress.
 

 
The day before ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ release, news broke about ‘Neverland Girl’ cast and themes trending online. A small corner of the entertainment industry buzzed about the film’s unique angle—Tong Zhao playing two lead roles, one male and one female. It was an unprecedented move in modern cinema, drawing immense interest.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo raised an eyebrow when he read the headlines. Was this what they’d poured their funding into? A dual-role gimmick?
 

 
His manager chimed in, sharing the same skepticism. “It’s a risky play. Romance movies usually stick to tried-and-true formulas. All this subconscious, dreamlike narrative stuff might alienate audiences. And let’s not forget Tong Zhao’s eccentric streak—she thrives on pushing boundaries, but it doesn’t always resonate.”
 

 
Gu Zhisuo nodded in agreement. “They’re betting on shock value, but safe storytelling is what wins hearts. Our film has broader appeal.”
 

 
Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the competition was creeping closer. He reassured himself with one comforting thought—’Sweet Rendezvous’ had secured the early release date.
 

 
That extra day could make all the difference.
 

 
For the production team of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, the weekend’s battle felt like a high-stakes game. All eyes were on Saturday. If audiences loved their film, they’d dominate the romantic genre slot, leaving ‘Neverland Girl’ with crumbs. If reception was lukewarm, the head start might not be enough to hold their ground.
 

 
Meanwhile, as the promotional campaigns hit full swing, moviegoers on social media began splitting into camps. Fans of Gu Zhisuo declared their loyalty, gushing over his on-screen charisma. Tong Zhao’s fan base remained quieter but deeply devoted, hyping up her daring choice to take on such a complex project.
 

 
By Friday night, hashtags for both films trended on Weibo. The stage was set for a cinematic showdown.
 

 
It wasn’t a grudge, not even a proper rivalry—just a small matter that Gu Zhisuo kept in mind. Secretly, he hoped ‘Neverland Girl’ wouldn’t perform as well as ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. That way, he could proudly spin the narrative into a story about his “sharp judgment,” his ability to “choose the right projects,” and proof that “he’s worth every penny.”
 

 
The early reviews for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had been decent.
 

 
Screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, ever the tactician, analyzed the situation in their group chat, saying the two films were of similar quality. There was no need to downplay their own efforts or overly hype the competition. If both films had an equal 50/50 chance of success, their stronger financial backing would tip the scales in their favor when it came to marketing.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo liked this perspective. It reassured him that he had made the right choice—not that ‘Neverland Girl’ had rejected him, but rather that it didn’t deserve him.
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
These three words became a rallying cry for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, a confidence boost that carried them through the final days leading up to the premiere. Judging by the frequent mentions of “50/50” in their group chat, an outsider might have thought it was a fan group for a controversial livestreamer.
 

 
When ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ hit theaters, it delivered exactly what the team expected: a moderate success. The opening day’s box office just barely broke the 10-million mark—enough to recover costs and ensure a profit. However, with its Saturday release, this peak day would likely be the highest point of its earnings, and the numbers were expected to decline steadily after that.
 

 
Sunday would bring ‘Neverland Girl’ debut, and any hopes of a box office spike on Monday seemed unrealistic.
 

 
In recent years, for a romance movie to surpass 10 million on its first day was no small feat. For the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, this performance—paired with its stable 7/10 rating from critics—was a relief. Many of them had been worried that Tong Zhao, a box office powerhouse, would crush their movie entirely. Now, with a solid start under their belts, the cast and crew threw themselves even more enthusiastically into roadshows and promotional events.
 

 
There was even decent buzz surrounding the film. Several streamers hosted holographic “watch parties” for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, with enough participants to make a noticeable impact.
 

 
But then Sunday came.
 

 
And everything changed.
 

 
Here’s what started appearing across platforms:
 

 
- “[Movie Night with HaiYe] Neverland Girl Premiere Watch Party”
 

 
- “[Tsundere Princess’s Film Picks] Hmph, it’s not like I ‘want’ you to join me or anything!”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: For Those Who Know, You Know”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: Exclusive Screening for Han Zhi Fans (Sorry, No Male Fans Allowed)”
 

 
At first, it was just a handful of streamers. But every refresh brought new watch party announcements, and soon, the first ten pages of trending streams were completely dominated by ‘Neverland Girl’. Even lesser-known streamers jumped on the bandwagon, eager to host synchronized screenings.
 

 
Holographic live streams worked as a ticketed event, meaning viewers paid to watch the movie while streamers earned a share of the tips and ad revenue. A significant portion of these earnings also went to the film studio.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, the number of live-streamed watch parties for a new movie often served as a reliable indicator of its popularity. And ‘Neverland Girl’? It was absolutely exploding.
 

 
The jokes and memes born from live streams often spread further and boost a movie’s popularity—a win-win commercial strategy.
 

 
Some fan group leaders even organized exclusive watch parties, requiring fan membership verification to join. This effectively created distinct fan spaces, where everyone could enjoy the movie their own way without interfering with others.
 

 
Even streamers who had been broadcasting unrelated content caught wind of the hype in the movie streaming zone. After investigating the buzz, many decided to join the trend. One of them was Hai Laoshi, a small-time streamer with the philosophy of “no shame in making money.” At the time, he was lazily streaming PUBG. However, when a friend mentioned the frenzy around ‘Neverland Girl’, he immediately tossed a grenade in-game to kill himself and exited the session:
 

 
“Hey everyone, I’ve been a loyal fan of Tong Zhao for ten years. I’ve been looking forward to this movie all week. If you don’t mind pitching in for a ticket, let’s watch it together!”
 

 
“After all, I was just streaming a shooting game, and Tong Zhao’s got great aim too. It’s all connected!”
 

 
[“Tong Zhao hasn’t even been in the industry for ten years.”]
 
[“How on earth is a romance film connected to shooting skills? This is the most hilariously shameless attempt at trend-jumping I’ve ever seen.”]
 
[“Classic Hai Laoshi—using his thick skin as bulletproof armor!”]
 

 
As a relatively obscure streamer, Hai Laoshi didn’t have many followers. This was precisely why he jumped on the hype train, hoping to gain some new viewers.
 

 
He quickly navigated to the movie streaming section, but to his dismay, the option to stream ‘Neverland Girl’, which had just been released that day, was grayed out.
 

 
Unconvinced, he clicked repeatedly.
 

 
Nothing happened.
 

 
“What the heck? Is the server down?”
 

 
This issue wasn’t unique to Hai Laoshi; similar problems were cropping up across the platform.
 

 
The platform’s response was swift. They issued a site-wide announcement: ‘Due to excessive demand, the large number of viewing rooms for ‘Neverland Girl’ has overwhelmed the servers. Streaming rooms for this movie are temporarily restricted to gold-level streamers or higher (current streams are not affected).
 

 
Creating a streaming room wasn’t difficult, and some users had specifically signed up as streamers just to host watch parties with their friends. This wasn’t an unprecedented occurrence. In the past, when highly anticipated blockbusters were released, the platform would preemptively set restrictions on streaming to prevent server overload, encouraging users to visit holographic cinemas for group viewings instead. For example, during the release of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, such measures had been implemented early on, avoiding any last-minute chaos.
 

 
But those were big-budget, effects-heavy blockbusters.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’, on the other hand, was an artistic romance film.
 

 
This level of demand? Unbelievable.
 

 
Hai Laoshi’s shocked expression was so over-the-top that one of his loyal fans recorded it. Later, it was included in a compilation of streamers reacting to the ‘Neverland Girl’ phenomenon. His exaggerated, near-eye-popping expression ended up earning him unexpected attention.
 

 
But that’s a story for another time.
 

 
#TongZhaoNewFilm#
 

 
# ‘Neverland Girl’ Faces Traffic Limits? The Largest Holographic Movie Platform Can't Handle It! #
 

 
No need to buy trending searches; the buzz is already here.
 

 
Aside from those who can go out to the theater with friends or lovers, and the regular moviegoers, there are also those who, on holidays, prefer to put on their holographic headsets and watch movies at home. These groups have all noticed the explosive popularity of ‘Neverland Girl’, which has become overwhelming. People are herd animals, so movies that are often both heavily criticized and praised by many tend to achieve good box office results through the same crowd mentality.
 

 
Bilibili video creators are complaining, Weibo’s homepage is filled with complaints, and coworkers, classmates, and friends are all trash-talking the movie—don’t you have to buy a ticket to see how bad it really is?
 

 
In this era of rising ticket prices, there are fewer films that use their bad reputation as a marketing tactic.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’ has generated a lot of heat, but is it good or bad?
 

 
The first batch of viewers hasn’t even spoken out yet!
 

 
Before, critics were saying it was great.
 

 
But for the general public, no one really knows whether it's good or bad.
 

 
However, its popularity must have a reason. Moreover, it stars Tong Zhao... People who have seen her previous movies, TV shows, and variety shows know she’s good, so it shouldn’t be boring, right? With this fanbase and the buzz around ‘the first film in 'Instinctive Cinema’ history to feature a single actor playing all the lead roles*, countless viewers hopped on the bandwagon, leading even more people into the theaters.
 

 
By Sunday afternoon, its box office had already surpassed Saturday’s ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ for the entire day.
 

 
What’s even scarier is that on Sunday, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ saw a drastic drop in its box office, well below expectations. Normally, a slight drop on the second day is expected, and with Sunday’s factors, the most optimistic forecast would be a small increase. The ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew had still held onto their “50-50” hope, thinking a slight decline was acceptable.
 

 
A piece of bad news hit the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
Not only did it drop, but it plummeted.
 

 
It crashed straight into the water with no splash, and no one cared.
 

 
Aside from Gu Zhisu’s fans and a few viewers who saw ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ yesterday and liked it, everyone else was discussing ‘Neverland Girl’ dominance on the charts and the impressive feat of almost crashing the movie platform’s servers.
 

 
This Sunday was destined to be a black day for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
The days before the movie release should have been the harvest phase for the whole crew’s hard work—brushing ticket sales, sharing glowing reviews, and reading ratings on review sites… but since the box office stats came out this afternoon, the group chat went completely silent, as if everyone had died.
 

 
After a while, the director broke the silence:
 

 
[“Have you seen the box office?”]
 

 
[“Mm...”]
 

 
[“Sigh, it’s normal since the neighbor had the first day; if the reviews are good, we’ll be fine later. Our quality is still solid.”]
 

 
Although there were words of comfort, the overall atmosphere in the group was still downcast.
 

 
The assistant director thought of Gu Zhisu and @-ed him in the group, jokingly suggesting, [“There’s nothing we can do, maybe let Zhisu do some promotion?”]
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s salary made up a significant portion of the production costs.
 

 
The investors were counting on him to carry the box office.
 

 
After all, his data on Weibo was very high, and among the new generation of popular stars, he was considered one of the most capable. He could encourage his fans, saying that one ticket per person wasn’t enough; they could buy multiple tickets or even buy them as gifts for others.
 

 
Gu Zhisu: [“Of course, I’m already thinking of a Weibo post. [Sunglasses Cat Head nodding wildly.jpg]”]
 

 
With his guarantee, the atmosphere in the WeChat group began to pick up a bit…
 

 
That sunglasses cat head was quite cute.
 

 
However, Gu Zhisu, holding his phone, had a handsome face with sharp brows and bright eyes, but his expression was as dark as the bottom of a pot. His persona was that of a pampered young master, but right now, his face looked like that of a rich second generation who had cruised through life relying on his only-child status for twenty years, only to discover that the government had implemented a two-child policy, and his mother quickly got pregnant and gave birth to a younger brother.
 

 
He was distressed.
 

 
These people didn’t understand the life of a traffic star.
 

 
The core fanbase, who were the most willing to spend and would go to great lengths for him, had already done all of the above without needing his promotion. What did that mean? It meant that the box office he could carry was limited—no more than that, and squeezing more out would only be a drop in the bucket.
 

 
Gu Zhisu had nothing left to give.
 

 
But he couldn’t tell them the truth. All he could do was come up with a sensational Weibo post to stir up his fans and squeeze out whatever remaining value he could from his loyal followers...
 

 
A little while later, a heartfelt Weibo post was born.
 

 
@Gu Zhisu v:
 

 
On this special day, there are so many things I want to say to you. My manager always tells me that the more I talk, the more I get into trouble, that I should say less. But I don’t care about that! I’m Duan Jia’s young master who’s not afraid of anything, and I want more people to see me play Duan Xinghe.
 

 
He then commented on this post: [Did you see Duan Xinghe?]
 

 
Fans immediately broke down in tears.
 

 
[Yes, yes! I not only want to see it myself, but I want everyone to see the best Duan Xinghe in the world, my favorite Zhisu!]
 

 
[Baby, you were great, really! Don’t let the outside noise affect you, okay?]
 

 
[Third time watching ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, still want to recommend it to more people!]
 

 
In just an hour, the post had been shared over ten thousand times.
 

 
The number of shares on Weibo sharply contrasted with the slow growth of the movie’s box office.
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s fans had worked hard.
 

 
But there was only so much money to be squeezed from his fans. In the box office for instinctive films, the traffic seemed like beautiful bubbles. When the box office was good, fans could help boost it higher, but expecting them to turn mediocrity into something magical? That was impossible.
 

 
Gu Zhisu understood that as well.
 

 
The Weibo post mobilizing the fans to feel the pain was also his way of doing his part and leaving the rest to fate, not wanting the production team to think he was collecting money without delivering results.
 

 
...
 

 
When the fans saw their beloved star feeling down, they immediately took the initiative to do some reading comprehension to figure out why he was upset. The reason was easy to understand—the box office data was publicly available and could be checked at any time.
 

 
Once they checked, the already broken defenses were further shattered by the harsh reality.
 

 
How could the comparison be so brutal?
 

 
They couldn’t understand.
 

 
Sweet Rendezvous’s promotion was actually quite strong, so much so that fans rarely praised the official team.
 

 
It’s a miracle considering how often fans curse out the official team, company, or agents. Clearly, the promotion for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ was heartfelt, with a heavy focus on Gu Zhisu, which greatly pleased his fans.
 

 
Why did the box office plummet so drastically on the second day?
 

 
Both Weibo and entertainment forums were buzzing with discussions.
 

 
The answer was simple.
 

 
Because ‘Neverland Girl’ exploded.
# Chapter114
The market is like a cake.
 

 
It’s not some fair and just “grandpa divides the pork” scenario where everyone gets an equal share. If someone takes a bigger slice, others inevitably get less. Films released during the same period are already competitors, especially if they’re in the same genre. Bad luck for one means good luck for the other. That’s why people say making a movie is like high-stakes gambling. If someone makes a decent film that scores a 60, but it comes out alongside a 90-point blockbuster, then too bad—audiences only have so much money to spend on movies. Once they’ve seen the higher-rated one, they likely won’t have the budget for the just-passable one.
 

 
Unless your film is so outstanding that it makes audiences dig deeper into their wallets for an additional ticket after watching the first one.
 

 
But ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ wasn’t good enough to expand the size of the cake.
 

 
Speaking of “grandpa divides the pork,” this seemingly fair and just idiom doesn’t actually include everyone—“everyone” usually excludes women and refers only to men. Life is full of visible and invisible competition. Everyone wants to win. From the investors and directors to the backstage crew of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, when they looked at the success of their rivals, their collective thought was: ‘Why couldn’t we be the ones taking the entire cake for this genre?’
 

 
If given the choice, everyone wants to be the winner.
 

 
---
 

 
“Anyone here who’s seen both? Can you explain the difference? Is Tong Zhao really that good?”
 

 
Some observant viewers noticed that when people discuss ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ they tend to refer to it by its title. But when it comes to ‘Neverland Girl’ they directly say Tong Zhao’s name or simply call it “the five-character movie.”
 

 
Is it because the movie’s title is too clunky, or is it that Tong Zhao truly carries the entire film?
 

 
Perhaps both.
 

 
Either way, the five-character movie has been deeply branded with Tong Zhao’s name.
 

 
If it flops, her myth will fall. If it succeeds, her reputation will be further gilded.
 

 
Whenever Tong Zhao has a new movie, the focus of discussions—whether among audiences or the media—is always her.
 

 
At some point, Tong Zhao’s success became a matter of course. Perhaps because there’s no real comparison point anymore.
 

 
No one has such a uniquely diverse subconscious. Imagine if you had three different styles or personas, but none of them were charming, distinctive, or capable—what good would it do? But Tong Zhao is extraordinarily gifted. Every time she pulls out a new persona from the depths of her repertoire, it’s incredibly captivating.
 

 
How can I describe it?
 

 
In the realm of instinct-driven films, when others become successful, it’s like a gift from the heavens—a stroke of luck. But for Tong Zhao, it’s as if the heavens prepared a full-course meal of three dishes and a soup, chasing after her to feed her, stuffing her with food. ‘Eat, eat to your heart’s content! Once you’ve finished these three dishes, dessert is waiting for you. Don’t hold back—this feast is endless!’
 

 
---
 

 
"Actually, I think ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is pretty good. GZS is really unlucky."*
 

 
"Shocking my entire village—are same-genre movies this competitive now?"
 

 
[Uh, OP, don’t misuse new buzzwords you just learned. “Involution” isn’t the right term here.]
 

 
[Movies released at the same time are competitors, and for those in the same genre, it’s even more cutthroat—it’s survival of the fittest. Besides, wasn’t the four-character film more hyped before? Fans of that movie made a huge fuss, but in the end, it couldn’t compare to a single woman carrying the box office.]
 

 
[Please don’t drag GZS into this, thank you. Respect women, please. Our side has always respected senior figures and never claimed to surpass them.]
 

 
After all that discussion, the conclusion is...
 

 
The difference between the two movies lies in Tong Zhao.
 

 
It’s not just vague impressions either. If you break it down with data and discussions, the spotlight is always on Tong Zhao and director Han. That’s proof that she’s carrying the entire film. The fact that she played two roles in one movie also piqued audience curiosity—something they’ve rarely, if ever, seen before.
 

 
Audiences aren’t particularly profound or nuanced as a group. Sometimes, getting them to buy tickets is remarkably simple.
 

 
It could be the movie features a cruel, unprecedented torture scene left entirely uncut.
 

 
It could be a major star, usually burdened by their pristine idol image, baring it all—man or woman, doesn’t matter. Even if it’s just a glimpse of their backside, it might draw enough attention to crush same-genre competition.
 

 
Is it unfair competition when it comes to Tong Zhao?
 

 
Professional doctors have pointed out that what she does imposes a heavy burden on her brain. For most actors, finishing such instinct-driven films leaves them mentally drained for days. But for Tong Zhao, the effects might last even longer. Fans have expressed concern, with some angrily accusing her agency of overworking her for profits. The agency explained that Tong Zhao has undergone specialized brain training for these roles.
 

 
Other actors don’t require such training because they don’t have such diverse subconscious capabilities.
 

 
But this only proves one thing: Tong Zhao has worked hard.
 

 
Fairness aside, she ‘deserves’ her success.
 

 
---
 

 
Sunday’s premiere of ‘Neverland Girl’ was the peak of Tong Zhao’s praise.
 

 
Most of the first wave of viewers bought tickets solely because of her.
 

 
The remaining motivations were scattered: “Critics said it’s decent,” “Sunday’s my only day off,” or “The plot summary looks interesting.”
 

 
Of course, what happens next is anyone’s guess.
 

 
Many in the industry didn’t expect ‘ Neverland Girl’ to dominate so overwhelmingly, and some even started to feel a little sympathy for ‘Sweet Rendezvous.’
 

 
“Did ‘Neverland Girl' have any major promotional campaigns? Not really. I didn’t see Tong Zhao on any variety shows this month. Even the trailer—I only came across it online. That proves the film didn’t have much of a promotional budget. Its box office pressure was even lighter than ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ simply because it had Tong Zhao. With her, they achieved low investment and high returns.”
 

 
“Never thought I’d see the day when Director Shi’s film was this strapped for cash.”
 

 
“Hahaha, but with such strong opening day box office numbers, surely they’ll start promoting it more? Who doesn’t want more money? I heard Tong Zhao fully funded this film herself. I can’t even imagine how much she’s making.”
 

 
“In the internet age, it’s all about creating buzz.”
 

 
“In comparison, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ feels too plain. Even the male lead doesn’t have the same charisma as Han Zhi…”
 

 
The last comment, posted by a film critic on Weibo, struck a nerve with Gu Zhisu’s fans, nearly sparking an online argument.
 

 
Fortunately, the critic’s friends quickly pointed out that saying such things would be seen as “stepping on others” in today’s youth culture. It would provoke backlash, both by drawing hate toward Han Zhi and offending Gu Zhisu’s fans, leaving the critic with nothing but insults in return. Realizing this, the critic deleted the post almost immediately, preventing any major conflict.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, meanwhile, were oblivious to this drama—they were busy doing something more productive.
 

 
What exactly?
 

 
Urging the official ‘Neverland Girl’ social media account to step up their promotional efforts. They insisted the team start booking variety shows, stop slacking, and stop being stingy. After all, with such promising box office trends, the film was bound to make a huge profit.
 

 
If it were another film, fans might scold the production team for being so tightfisted and indifferent to their idol. But when it came to this movie, the tone was completely different.
 

 
Here’s the emotional journey of the fans:
 

 
First: “Stupid stingy team! Are you neglecting my precious baby? Treat Zhao Zhao and Director Han better!”
 

 
Then: “Wait a minute... the main investor ‘is’ my baby.”
 

 
Finally, the fans turned to humor and started making memes. A giant stick figure sprawled on the ground, begging the official account to put more effort into promotions. Beside it was a tiny stick figure with a pacifier in its mouth asking, “Snacks? What snacks are there to eat?”
 

 
Their cheerful attitude was so unusual it went viral. The meme-filled comment section became another hot topic of discussion.
 

 
Confused onlookers chimed in:
 

 
“This pacifier meme doesn’t match Tong Zhao’s image. Feels out of character. Wouldn’t it make more sense if Zhao Jie was holding a cigarette?”
 

 
Which other actress gives people the impression of puffing on a cigarette? The internet burst into laughter.
 

 
When first-day viewers saw the film, they added:
 

 
“Just watched Tong Zhao’s new movie. Sister Zhao has turned into Zhao Bao ( treasure or precious Zhao).”
 

 
Turned into Zhao Bao?
 

 
If you said Tong Zhao was dominating the screen, cutting down enemies left and right, audiences would be used to it. But if you said she became a childlike character in the movie—that’s something worth talking about.
 

 
By Sunday, audience reviews and impressions of the films gradually entered the public eye.
 

 
As more people watched the films, the number of discussion points grew.
 

 
Romance films typically target couples and female audiences. For example, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ marketed itself from the title onward, encouraging women to “bring your boyfriend for a sweet date.” In contrast, the title of the neighboring film (Neverland Girl) leaned into a more artsy and abstract vibe. Yet, despite its lack of overt appeal, the latter blew up—and with good reason.
 

 
If ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is characterized by steadiness, ‘Neverland Girl’ is defined by boldness.
 

 
Once the film was officially released, some short clips inevitably began circulating online.
 

 
Although this technically counts as copyright infringement, the production team usually turns a blind eye. After all, to truly experience the immersive visuals and atmosphere, audiences still need to buy tickets for the holographic version. These leaked clips act as free publicity, saving the studio even more promotional expenses—much to their delight.
 

 
Interestingly, the focus of these viral clips was no longer solely on Tong Zhao but shifted to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
So, what’s the story here?
 

 
Under the dual pressure from both the movie’s fans and Tong Zhao’s fans, the production team finally agreed to appear on a talk show for promotional purposes.
 

 
And when they finally showed up, they went big, choosing the hottest and most tightly scheduled program of the moment, ‘Let’s Start Shooting!’
 

 
The show primarily invites stars with recent works to chat casually in a relaxed atmosphere. However, the title of the program has a different connotation in Cantonese, where "start shooting" (kaai pin) colloquially means “start a brawl.” Perhaps the name was fitting, as the host, Xue Yutang, was famous for his daring and sometimes provocative questions. Early on, some guests struggled to respond to his sharp commentary, occasionally finding themselves at a loss. Over time, only the most thick-skinned or playful celebrities dared to appear on the show, which in turn boosted its entertainment value immensely.
 

 
Once the ratings climbed, even those who initially avoided the show found themselves willing to participate.
 

 
The guests representing ‘ Neverland Girl' were Shi Qianqiu, Qian Rui, and Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Today, we have three guests, though calling it four wouldn’t be unreasonable,” Xue Yutang teased as he introduced them.
 

 
“In fact, if the budget had allowed for this episode to be filmed in holographic format, I would’ve loved to invite the mysterious fourth guest.”
 

 
He let out an exaggerated sigh.
 

 
The live audience began murmuring, already guessing who he was referring to. After all, Han Zhi’s name had recently resurged in popularity due to the film’s buzz, becoming a trending topic once again.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned toward a particular direction in the studio and declared, “Let’s give a warm welcome to ‘Neverland Girl’’s writer-director, the lead actors, and the art director!”
 

 
The four sat in a semicircle, with Xue Yutang reclining on a personal sofa. In the center was a decorative coffee table.
 

 
Xue Yutang introduced the two behind-the-scenes crew members first.
 

 
“Oh, and speaking of the lead actor,” Xue Yutang added with a playful smirk, “if I didn’t clarify, everyone might assume Director Shi *is* the male lead!”
 

 
Xue Yutang wasn’t wrong.
 

 
Some members of the live audience, unfamiliar with Shi Qianqiu, took one look at his strikingly handsome face and instinctively assumed he was just another fresh-faced actor they couldn’t recognize. When they learned he was the director, recognition started dawning on some of them, recalling related news stories—after all, Shi’s face had gone viral before for his infamous line: *"If you want me to act as the male lead, that’s a whole different price tag."*
 

 
Tong Zhao chimed in with a laugh: “Director Shi isn’t cheap. Our production couldn’t afford him.”
 

 
Her remark brought laughter from both the host and the live audience.
 

 
The film crew’s tight budget became one of the key talking points of this episode.
 

 
“Still, when it comes to looks, the male lead, Han Zhi, has the edge,” Xue Yutang quipped, gesturing toward the screen.
 

 
Immediately, a large screen displayed highlight clips of Han Zhi from the movie, focusing on his most captivating moments. One scene, in particular, stood out: Han Zhi and Sylia caught in the rain in a garden. His white shirt, soaked and clinging to his body, revealed a perfect outline of his muscles. The rain blurred his glasses, obscuring his eyes until he reached up, took them off, and stared intensely at the camera. The silence in the scene was heavy with unspoken desire, like an overwhelming flood of Alpha energy crashing over the audience.
 

 
It was breathtaking.
 

 
The female audience members began to stir, visibly excited.
 

 
Seizing the moment, Xue Yutang offered a brief introduction to Han Zhi’s character. Naturally, he pivoted to one of the audience’s burning questions about Tong Zhao’s performance: playing two characters. Teasing her, Xue encouraged her to try embodying Han Zhi’s aura on the spot.
 

 
In the post-Instinct Film era, acting in the traditional sense was rare. But since she had tapped into Han Zhi’s subconscious for the movie, Xue reasoned, surely she could replicate at least 60–70% of his charisma in real life, right?
 

 
This playful challenge had clearly been pre-approved by the crew.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll give it a shot,” Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
Xue Yutang pretended to ponder for a moment. “Han Zhi’s other role, Nie Su, is quite the schemer, right? Let’s have Tong Zhao play Nie Su charming someone for a change. Hmm, but where are we going to find a ‘younger sister’ for her to flirt with? Director Shi, could you help us out?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu responded flatly: “No.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him. “Come on, play along. We’re here to promote the movie.”
 

 
Qian Rui chimed in, backing her up: “Think about the promotional budget—doesn’t it suddenly seem worth it?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu frowned, feigning reluctance before sighing in defeat. “Fine.”
 

 
The show’s staff quickly brought out props. Following Tong Zhao’s instructions, they handed her a long black trench coat and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses. She tied her long hair back, while the staff placed a black wig on Shi Qianqiu’s head.
 

 
The wig wasn’t properly adjusted and looked noticeably fake, but Shi Qianqiu’s striking features still stood out. His pale complexion and refined facial structure gave him a distinctive, elegant beauty—almost like a classic Chinese painting come to life.
 

 
“You’re stunning,” Tong Zhao complimented.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a sidelong glance.
 

 
A simple glance would have been unremarkable, but Shi couldn’t resist spicing things up. Adding a touch of flair, his gaze carried a hint of playful mischief and a tinge of vulnerability, as if silently saying “Won’t you pity me?” The effect was captivating enough to make the audience momentarily forget about the cheap wig perched on his head.
 

 
Unexpectedly roped into this scenario, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and called for Han Zhi to step in and play along.
 

 
Han Zhi: “...Wasn’t this supposed to be an interactive segment with a female guest from the audience?”
 

 
The idea of playing out a scene with another man left him reluctant, and he showed it plainly.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I think they said having Shi Qianqiu do it would be more effective. Just pretend he’s a girl!”
 

 
This made Han Zhi feel like a duck being herded onto a rack.
 

 
Not ‘that’ kind of duck.
 

 
The kind being forced into something against its will.
 

 
Despite his reservations, Han Zhi remained professional and slipped into the role of the primary persona. Onstage, he executed a suave sequence where he draped a trench coat over Shi Qianqiu’s shoulders, performing the classic “charming protector” move.
 

 
After wrapping the coat around him, Han Zhi paused, staring at him intently.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, slightly unnerved, asked, “What is it?”
 

 
Han Zhi let his gaze linger on Shi’s ear for a moment before answering:
 

 
"There’s snow on it."
 

 
With that, he reached out, as if to brush the imaginary snow away, his fingertip deliberately grazing the sensitive skin behind Shi’s ear.
 

 
Throughout the coat-draping part, Han Zhi had maintained a gentlemanly distance. Nobody had expected such a subtle yet provocative gesture to follow.
 

 
The fleeting touch was barely there, but the skin behind the ear was especially sensitive. Shi Qianqiu was completely unprepared and momentarily caught off guard by the move.
 

 
Looking at the audience, Han Zhi gave a charming smile and announced: “Alright, that’s the scene.”
 

 
Then he practically fled the stage, relinquishing the lead persona back to Tong Zhao as quickly as he could.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she was greeted by the sight of Shi Qianqiu sitting there, staring at her in utter disbelief, as if his innocence had just been stolen.
# Chapter115
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't forget that expression—an odd mix of shock, disdain, and a hint of contemplation.
 

 
The two of them, being sharp and experienced, quickly remembered they were filming a show. With a smile still lingering on her face, Tong Zhao returned to her seat and casually remarked, "Something like that... If I had applied a proper full-face makeup, it would look even more like a guy."
 

 
The people on and off stage treated her words as modesty.
 

 
Xue Yutang shook his head repeatedly, clearly impressed. "No, that was amazing. The character switch just now—it really felt like there was a man’s soul hiding inside you. And not just any man, but a total player and heartbreaker." Known for his sharp tongue, Xue gave her high praise with an uncharacteristically genuine tone, showing how thoroughly impressed he was. "Even if it were still the era of traditional films, your acting alone would guarantee you’d be a star!"
 

 
It was truly astonishing. If not for Tong Zhao's star power and professionalism preventing the host from treating her like a mere spectacle, Xue Yutang might have even asked her to perform again.
 

 
The fact remained: she was still the same person.
 

 
She only added a trench coat, with no changes to her styling or features. She didn’t even pull any exaggerated expressions. It was clear she wasn’t the theatrical type. Yet, in just the blink of an eye, her aura had transformed. Her interactions with Shi Qianqiu were entirely different from when she portrayed her female self, leaving everyone in awe.
 

 
"It's as if a completely different soul has taken over," Xue Yutang exclaimed with a chuckle. "If you told me you could summon spirits, I’d believe it."
 

 
---
 

 
Dan Ge: "Han Zhi, forever a legend!"
 
Chen Guifei: "Hahaha, I can’t! Shi Qianqiu’s expression just now was absolutely priceless!"
 

 
Han Zhi felt like he’d taken some serious emotional damage.
 

 
He was tainted. He was no longer pure.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Shi Qianqiu and asked, “What was it like for you?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pressed his temples and sighed dramatically, removing the wig in a way that evoked the tired resignation of a dancer removing her makeup after a grueling performance. “Promoting a movie is no joke… If the box office doesn’t shoot up by at least a hundred million, it’d be an insult to my worth.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked. “You certainly think highly of yourself.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gave her a fake smile. “Well, I’m pairing up with you for this, aren’t I? Your fans should at least do me the courtesy.”
 

 
“Would they really?” Xue Yutang cut in smoothly, teasing, “Should they start calling you ‘brother-in-law’ now?”
 

 
Recently, several celebrities had been exposed for having secret relationships, causing fan communities to implode under the weight of such revelations.
 

 
“It’s impossible. After watching the movie, they’d probably scold me for dating too young,” Tong Zhao joked. She then paused deliberately, pretending to realize something. “Wait, did I just spoil the plot?”
 

 
Qian Rui interjected at just the right moment, “It’s already mentioned in the synopsis, so it doesn’t count as a spoiler from Sister Zhao.”
 

 
Xue Yutang smoothed things over with a laugh, segueing into showing clips of Zhao Zai’s playful and clumsy moments on the big screen.
 

 
In the clip, Zhao Zai could be seen rolling, tripping, and smacking her head, only to freeze in stunned embarrassment before trying to escape back to her room. But Concubine Chen stopped her, dragged her back, and forced her to watch herself. It was almost as if the production team had a vendetta, carefully editing together every foolish moment: pouting over green peppers she didn’t want to eat, clutching a giant teddy bear in fear of the dark, sneaking into the male lead’s room at midnight...
 

 
The public humiliation left Zhao Zai looking like she’d been struck by lightning.
 

 
She couldn’t face the audience anymore!
 

 
She was officially the dumbest “Zai” on this street!
 

 
In the quick-transmigration arcs, Zhao Zai had always thought herself clever and heroic, successfully taming four future villains to the point they obeyed her like loyal disciples. They saw her as a future wife, but she viewed them like little brothers. Perhaps it was the first-person perspective that gave her the illusion of superiority. But now, watching herself from the third-person in this immersive film, she realized—
 

 
Good grief, she’d been a fool all along.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Zhao Zai spun in circles, mortified. Tong Zhao, amused, steered the conversation away as Xue Yutang praised her. “Adorable, definitely. But I didn’t expect Tong Zhao’s subconscious to have such an innocent side.”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because my previous roles gave off a tougher impression,” Tong Zhao replied thoughtfully. “But honestly, the female lead in my new movie has a tough side too. Comparatively, the male lead is actually the softer one.” She glanced at Shi Qianqiu. “Remember how we were rumored to have secret meetings? That was just us discussing the personalities of these two characters back then.”
 

 
“Exactly.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu picked up the thread effortlessly, returning to his usual composed demeanor. “One is strong because she’s pure; the other is gentle because he’s complicated. The most fascinating thing is how she can bring both characters to life. Sometimes, I seriously consider flipping her upside down and shaking her, just to see if I can shake out more interesting subconscious personalities.”
 

 
No one expected Shi Qianqiu to have such bold ambitions, nor that he’d be so unafraid of provoking fans.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Tong Zhao with a grin. “Are you afraid of him?”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed. “He can’t beat me. Who ties up who is still up for debate.”
 

 
“Watch your words,” Shi Qianqiu said, his scholarly fake smile perfectly in place. “I’d rather not see even more outrageous rumors about me trending online.”
 

 
At that moment, the director’s voice came in off-screen, gently reminding them, “Brother Xue, please treasure your show.”
 

 
That tone immediately reminded the young audience of the superadmin warnings issued to streamers who cross the line or share inappropriate content, urging them to "cherish your live stream." Laughter erupted across the scene.
 

 
Being the host of an interview show isn't easy. Asking questions that cross the line might offend the guests, but if the host is too cautious, worried about the guests' status, the audience will find it boring and stop watching, which is essentially sabotaging their own career. Before the show, Xue Yutang specifically asked both guests if there were any topics that should be avoided, so he could be more careful.
 

 
Both guests answered that there were no taboos and that anything could be discussed.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he decided not to bring up anything sensitive, and Xue Yutang immediately looked at Tong Zhao—currently the hottest rising star with an unmatched level of popularity—with newfound respect. He remembered hearing rumors from a previous food variety show that she had a tendency to be difficult and act aloof. But after meeting her in person, he realized it was all just gossip. She was very easygoing, and her rise to fame was well-deserved.
 

 
It wasn’t entirely a rumor though.
 

 
After all, the person appearing on the show was none other than the famous concubine.
 

 
The more beautiful someone is, the bigger their ego seems to be. Her airs were grand enough to match a lavish banquet.
 

 
As the atmosphere began to settle, Xue Yutang shifted to more in-depth questions.
 

 
He asked Tong Zhao about her experience with her first film investment, whether she encountered any interesting situations while collaborating with others, and how she got along with Shi Qianqiu. He also mentioned hearing that many male actors were rejected during the casting process and wondered if that was true.
 

 
These were all pieces of gossip the audience would be eager to hear.
 

 
Tong Zhao followed up, sharing a bit of gossip: “Because I had to portray the amnesia-stricken female lead, I needed to pull myself out of the filming process and switch to a completely different state of mind. During that time, the doctor advised me to take a break, so I went backstage and had afternoon tea with the crew.”
 

 
“And then?” Xue Yutang leaned forward, looking intrigued.
 

 
“When I was filming ‘Instinct’, I really got into the role, and my mindset was kind of like a child’s. I had discussed this with Director Shi beforehand. And then guess what happened? He came up to me and said…”
 

 
Tong Zhao mimicked Shi Qianqiu’s relaxed attitude, speaking with great seriousness:
 

 
“Do you know? There’s no such thing as Ultraman in this world.”
 

 
…
 

 
“It didn’t really work on her,” Shi Qianqiu said, shrugging. “When my little brother first started primary school, that line made him cry. He held onto that grievance for a whole week.”
 

 
Tong Zhao added, “He saw that Ultraman couldn’t hurt me, so he started talking about Santa Claus and made up a scary story. I wasn’t expecting it at all…”
 

 
She showed a slightly embarrassed expression as she recalled the moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu helped finish her story: “It scared her so much that she ended up hiccupping.”
 

 
The idea of Tong Zhao being scared to the point of hiccupping was hard to imagine at first. But after the recent clip of Zhao Zai aired, along with her soft and sweet smile, her gentle eyes that shone like precious jade, it was easy to imagine her having a cute and innocent aura. Looking back on the situation, Tong Zhao played along and puckered her lips as if she was embarrassed.
 

 
Usually, Sister Zhao presents herself as a cold and perfect image, but now, openly acting cute—what a hard worker!
 

 
As for the topic of the male lead in ‘Neverland Gir’, it was a very sensitive subject.
 

 
If the list of candidates were actually named, it would offend quite a large group of people.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't intend to take the lead in everything on her own, so she only confirmed that some friends had expressed interest, but none had actually reached the audition stage: “Jiang Dang is quite eager to collaborate with me again, and I’m also looking forward to it. I hope there will be another chance next time.” She mentioned a real name to add some intrigue and prevent the conversation from becoming too generic.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao had asked Jiang Dang for his opinion beforehand.
 

 
He said it didn’t matter.
 

 
After a while, he even texted her: "Do you want me to get my Weibo password back, post a few emotional posts to increase credibility? Would that give you more face?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "There’s no need."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I saw your manager bought a bunch of quick-acting heart-saving pills for Double 12, that’s probably your doing."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I'll take better care of him."
 

 
Later, as Tong Zhao was scrolling through her WeChat Moments, she saw a post from Jiang Dang’s manager, clearly upset, with a screenshot of a conversation. Jiang Dang had sent him a message saying, “[Drink more hot water].”
 

 
Drinking more hot water was one thing, but adding candles? The title of "Most Annoying Singer of the Year" was truly deserved.
 

 
When Xue Yutang mentioned one of Tong Zhao's rumored romantic interests, he immediately became energized. However, she didn’t let him drag the topic too deep. They subtly shifted the conversation back to the film, as the most discussed topic of ‘Heartless Tribulation' recently—apart from Tong Zhao—was its art direction.
 

 
People might start to feel resentful toward the film if they overhype her association with it.
 

 
Is it true that without Tong Zhao, the movie would be worthless?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t want others to evaluate her films that way.
 

 
The movie was the result of the hard work of many behind-the-scenes staff, and the audience had noticed that. All she needed to do was cooperate with the promotion and play the supporting role while others took the spotlight—though Shi Qianqiu didn’t care at all. He found it quite amusing and simply decided to credit her for his work as well. He wanted to witness the birth of the Thanos of the current film industry.
 

 
The art director, Qian Rui, hurried to clarify that he had only played a supportive role in adjusting things.
 

 
The aesthetic direction of the entire film was steered by Director Shi.
 

 
Xue Yutang sighed, “Your entire crew has such a childlike spirit.”
 

 
Qian Rui agreed, “Yes, Director Shi has so many cute ideas.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was clearly uncomfortable with that description and showed an expression of silent discontent.
 

 
Later, when the show aired, many viewers became interested in the handsome men and women and the visual spectacle shown in the trailers and movie clips. As more people watched ‘Neverland Girl’, the one-sided praise for Tong Zhao started to decrease. Not that no one was still praising her, but now people were talking more about the film's other merits.
 

 
However, no matter how much praise was heaped on others, it all inevitably circled back to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was impressive, and Tong Zhao, the one who invited him to be the director, was certainly no ordinary person. No one credited Xu Yiming for this achievement. The only thing Xu Yiming did well was handing the script to Tong Zhao.
 

 
She really is everywhere!

This particular episode of ‘Let's Start Filming’ had a particularly thick barrage of comments.
 

 
Just the segment where Tong Zhao, as the male lead of her new film, flirted with Shi Qianqiu resulted in countless memes flying across the screen.
 

 
[Life is hopeless.JPG], [I'm dirty.JPG], [Shi Qianqiu, full of charm.JPG]... It was hard to even find the complete set of memes, there were just too many. Netizens looked at this and thought, didn’t they say the two were rumored to be in a hot, romantic relationship? Why does it look like they can’t stand each other?
 

 
Then came the hilarious stories from the set.
 

 
[Shi the old thief, never acting human, scared my Zhao Bao to hiccup! Come out and take the beating!]
 

 
[Just send a knife in the mail and be done with it.]
 

 
[Oh my god, I can’t believe that such beautiful scenes from ‘Neverland Girl’ came from Shi the old thief. My mindset just shattered, I can’t accept that he has a beautiful soul!]
 

 
[No, his heart is still dark, he just has eyes that are good at spotting beauty…]
 

 
Tong Zhao herself thought her relationship with Shi Qianqiu was more like that of good buddies.
 

 
Even when they were on the show, the smell of romance and cheesy drama just didn’t exist.
 

 
But it was hard to fight against netizens who looked at her through a thick pink filter. They clipped the part where she flirted with Shi Qianqiu and added the recent popular TikTok song, “Did I just realize, you are my antidote––”
 

 
It was impressive.
 

 
They turned Shi Qianqiu’s incredulous expression into an atmosphere of bashfulness.
 

 
It wasn’t exactly making something out of nothing.
 

 
It was more like a maliciously fabricated, shipping-level kind of slander.
 

 
The short video was edited very well.
 

 
The video creator, clearly desperate for attention, thought to themselves, "The brave survive and the timid starve," and tagged Shi Qianqiu on Weibo, asking him how he felt about the level of editing.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied:
 

 
[If it gets over 500 shares, you’ll be going to jail.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu wasn’t actually angry, and the video creator knew how to play it cool. They pretended to back off and personally funded a promotion, offering 20 holographic ‘Neverland Girl' movie tickets in a lottery to fans, as a way of giving back. Shi Qianqiu then liked the post, essentially giving his silent approval.
 

 
Fans who followed the couple from the beginning and watched until the end pieced together the storyline, and the onlookers couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
 

 
The movie's box office performed well, but Director Shi didn’t take any royalties—nothing to do with him.
 

 
So why was he so invested in promoting it?
 

 
It seemed like he had his own motives, maybe a deep connection with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some said that even if he wasn’t taking a share of the profits, the director would still want his hard work to pay off.
 

 
But Shi Qianqiu had worked on many successful films with high box office earnings before, yet we had never seen him promote so enthusiastically. What was going on? Opinions were divided. The couple’s ship was sailing strong, and there were theories behind it. Whether it was Shi or Zhao, both were seen as successful people in the public’s eyes, and successful people surely did things with careful planning—every move had ten steps already figured out.
 

 
However, the truth was simple:
 

 
"Bro, what have you been up to lately? You never come home for dinner."
 

 
At the Shi household.
 

 
A young, handsome man with a receding hairline, his voice tinged with a hint of complaint, asked.
 

 
Shi Wan Dong had always been his older brother’s shadow when they were kids, and even now, though his admiration had changed, he still looked up to him. But now, his life had other priorities—managing the family business, and his deep relationship with his fiancée.
 

 
"Not much."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu naturally picked up a piece of green pepper—his least favorite—and put it into his brother's bowl: "Every time a new movie of mine is released, I have to do publicity. It'll settle down after a while. And what about you? Never bring your girlfriend over for dinner?"
 

 
"Don’t talk about Xuanxuan."
 

 
Even though he admired his older brother, Shi Wandong decided that before marriage, he would definitely keep his girlfriend out of sight—especially from his brother. He had noticed that his previous girlfriends, after meeting his older brother, mysteriously ended up liking him instead. Shi Qianqiu had never done anything to encourage it; the brothers just had different tastes in women, and perhaps it was simply destiny that his brother’s charm always overshadowed his own.
 

 
Shi Wandong changed the subject: "The movie is making money, but it won’t end up in your pocket."
 

 
That was true; the earnings didn’t go to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
"This is the first time I’ve worked on a movie with such a tight budget. Your brother is experiencing life firsthand, and it’s actually pretty interesting."
 

 
Shi Wandong understood.
 

 
"As long as you’re happy, big bro."
 

 
"Then what about Tong Zhao? Will I ever have a proper sister-in-law?"
 

 
"Don’t mention her. Her acting is actually quite good. The other day, she was pretending to be a man on the show. But when we were doing publicity, I kept thinking she should have gone into the men's restroom with me."
 

 
As Shi Qianqiu spoke, he absentmindedly rubbed his ear.
 

 
It was the same spot that Han Zhi had “harassed” him that day.
 

 
Shi Wandong looked at his older brother for a while and suddenly said, "Bro, I’m actually knowledgeable about the transgender community. I wouldn’t mind having a ‘spiritual’ male sister-in-law."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s response was to fill his brother’s bowl with a heap of green peppers.
 

 
*
 

 
A week after the movie’s release, the neighboring critics were lying down, ready to be ridiculed.
 

 
There was no ridicule, though.
 

 
Because no one was discussing it—everyone was talking about ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
Some people were saying that the female protagonist’s villa, designed by the famous director Shi, looked so magnificent and dreamy, almost like a castle. If only there were theme parks like Universal Studios in China, they would love to visit it in person.
 

 
Others said that Han Zhi’s portrayal of Nie Su was so captivating that it was a love-at-first-sight kind of performance.
 

 
"Stop pretending to be a liar, come be an old Baby’s little wolfdog. I’d be happy to take care of him."
 

 
Then there were those who were charmed by Tong Zhao, saying they never expected she had such a cute side to her.
 

 
A new group began to rise:
 

 
[Gathering of Tong Zhao's dad fans here!]
 

 
[Since Han Zhi modeled for the character, how about creating a long-term model for young Tong Zhao as well? I want to see more of her!]
 

 
Male fans calling for the “father’s approval” were immediately reprimanded by female fans defending Tong Zhao, telling them not to speak like that as it would bring bad influences to their beloved. The male fans thought about it and quickly changed their wording: [Tong Zhao’s mama loves you!]
 

 
Not long after, they were pointed out again: [Always talking about mama, mama, mama?]
 

 
Fine, let them call her “mama”!
 

 
Tong Zhao showed this to Zhao Zai, and everyone loved her.
 

 
Zhao Zai was initially very pleased, her face flushed, but soon she saw the “mama fans” commenting:
 

 
"Protect the world's cutest Zhao Zai!"
 

 
...
 

 
Zhao Zai pouted and quickly dashed back to her room to sulk.
 

 
[Congratulations, host! You’ve activated Zhao Zai’s passive skill: "The Group's Favorite Aura." From the elderly to children, there is no one who doesn’t like this little one! If the person holds no ill will towards the host, they’ll automatically have 40% favorability.]
 

 
40% favorability...
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s experience with quick transmigration, this meant that the person would unconsciously find her likable, wanting to care for her, but it wouldn’t be to the point of being madly infatuated.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought this might be useful for business and TV appearances, but she didn’t want to keep it active all the time. Still, she was a bit puzzled: [Didn’t Brother Zhi and Shuyi activate skills for me before?] She actually also wanted to say, “I didn’t know the system was still active.”
 

 
System: [Not activated.]
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed that perhaps there were some conditions she wasn’t aware of.
 

 
Now that life was going smoothly, she didn’t feel the need to turn herself into a jack-of-all-trades, an all-powerful “Thanos,” so she didn’t pursue any other skills.
 

 
For now, she was already quite capable.
 

 
After ‘Neverland Girl' had been out for about a month, the box office was raking in money at a crazy rate, eventually reaching a number that even a romance movie would never dare to dream of.
 

 
Two billion!
 

 
Next door, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ only earned a quarter of that, and it was still considered to have broken even—it's not considered a failure, after all. In the entire film industry, most movies end up losing money. It's often like the pharmaceutical industry developing new drugs; investors rely on the profitable projects to cover the losses, and if they make a profit by the end of the year, it's considered a success.
 

 
Films in the industry can lose money severely, but when they earn, they earn big.
 

 
This number is terrifying.
 

 
The industry was shocked. Could a romance movie really make that much money? After some post-analysis of the data, it turns out that there hadn’t been any high-quality romance films in the last six months. The industry turned to big-budget special effects films because they were considered more profitable. Shi Qianqiu came up with a perfect idea that combined both elements, filling the gap in the market.
 

 
Fans started doing the math, and after subtracting the costs and various other expenses, Tong Zhao had made quite a fortune from this. At the very least, the recent drama with her mortgage loan, once she gets this money, she could outright purchase a new house.
 

 
Other stars’ fans were a bit jealous, saying that the money was just too easy to make.
 

 
Entertainment forums often had industry professionals commenting, as the entire industry relied heavily on behind-the-scenes staff. They came out to break things down for the netizens:
 

 
The entire film industry’s earnings are like an upside-down pyramid: the hits make most of the box office revenue, while the flops sit at the bottom with no return.
 

 
If your idol wants to earn so much, they either need to use their own savings to invest in movies or be famous enough to directly negotiate a deal with the producers for a cut of the profits. Otherwise, forget about it.
 

 
At this point, a netizen commented in the thread:
 

 
[Stop, the tears can't be held back anymore. Let's not discuss her, TZ is truly one of a kind.]
 

 
[No, I love hearing this, don’t mind the delicate feelings, keep talking about the profit sharing.]
 

 
Soon after, other gossip-loving netizens moved on to different threads. Another hot topic was Tong Zhao’s father—
 

 
Every time she made money, there was always someone bringing up her scoundrel father.
 

 
What was he doing, anyway? Just bury him already.
 

 
Even if he’s buried, they’ll dig him up and whip his corpse.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was a well-known figure, and his recent situation was easy to find out—he had just sent his youngest daughter off to marry. He worked himself to the bone, scraping by to manage the company, and the net profit of the company might take ten years to equal what his eldest daughter earned from one movie.
 

 
No one knew what his feelings would be upon seeing the overwhelming praise for Tong Zhao all over the news and online.
 

 
The netizens guessed correctly—it probably felt worse than having his ancestor’s grave dug up.
 

 
The gossiping netizens were having a blast, continuously digging up and whipping his reputation, like a cruel revival of buried suffering. Meanwhile, Tong Zhao had completely forgotten to flaunt her success to him—it just wasn’t on her mind; she was too busy. With the film promotion winding down, she was now focused on handling a large sum of money that had come her way, looking for ways to make it grow.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s investment success had finally won over the film industry.
 

 
To put it this way, in the past, when Hong Kong films shot police and gangster movies, they’d pay respects to Guan Gong.
 

 
Now, when filmmakers in China make instinctive films, there are plenty who secretly offer a prayer to a photo of Tong Zhao, almost as if they wanted to present her with some gold ingots and candles, hoping to share in her good fortune.
 

 
Sister Chu brought over a pile of projects, hoping to let Tong Zhao choose.
 

 
Outsiders believed that someone as big as Tong Zhao should be living a life full of glamorous parties.
 

 
But not Tong Zhao. She stayed in her spacious flat, played by herself when she was tired, and when she wasn’t, she watched the stock market.
 

 
Recently, she had a feeling that another door in her mental palace was about to open.
 

 
As she was pondering this, her agent, Sister Chu, told her:
 

 
"Many variety shows want to invite you to make an appearance. Would you like to pick one to try out?”
# Chapter116
Tong Zhao was overwhelmed by the options.
 

 
The projects presented to her included not only invitations to appear as a short-term guest on popular existing variety shows but also concepts that hadn't yet begun production and were still in the idea phase. Sister Chu explained, "If you express even a slight interest, funding and production teams will immediately get to work. Just pick whatever you like."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Sister Chu added, "You can narrow it down to a few you’re interested in. If you’re unsure, I can take them back and discuss with the team to select the one that suits you best from all angles."
 

 
After all, handling these decisions was the job of her manager and team—to let the artist fully focus on their creative work.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and began sifting through the variety show proposals.
 

 
There were so many that it was dizzying.
 

 
She first eliminated the survival-themed shows. After the wildly successful ‘One Life Survivor’ aired and revealed its rating data—a sharp V-shaped curve with a significant disparity between the episodes featuring Tong Zhao and those without her—similar survival programs began flooding her with invitations.
 

 
Since Duan Ge's grievances had been adequately vented during that program, leaving him calm for now, Tong Zhao had no plans to revisit that genre anytime soon.
 

 
As a result, she set aside a pile of invitations that guaranteed her center stage and heavily marketed the programs around her, not even bothering to glance at them.
 

 
There was ‘Quirky Stand-Up’, a comedy-based talk show.
 
‘New Era Talent Group’, a talent competition show, invited her as a special guest mentor and mystery star. Tong Zhao was somewhat interested in this one—since it was just a one-time appearance, she marked it with a star.
 
‘Cohabitation Era’, a program about celebrities experiencing rental life.
 

 
...
 

 
After excluding the food, travel, and entertainment-focused variety shows, Tong Zhao found herself with few programs that truly piqued her interest. Ultimately, she singled out a seven-day immersive reality show, ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
The highlight of the show was watching celebrities take care of children. The most entertaining aspect was the interaction between the stars and the adorable yet mischievous kids. The production team somehow managed to invite children with extraordinary backgrounds—half of them were second-generation kids of big-name stars, renowned singers, famous directors, and other influential figures.
 

 
The remaining kids, though not from celebrity families, often had unique characteristics due to their upbringing.
 

 
Rambunctious kids are already a handful, but these were not only someone else's children but also kids with powerful backgrounds. Even on an immersive reality show, no one dared truly scold them. One by one, young male idols and female stars were driven to the edge, turning chaos into high ratings for the show.
 

 
These second-generation toddlers were notoriously difficult to handle.
 

 
In real life, they might suppress their personalities, acting indifferent toward what they deemed “stupid adults.” But on this show, they were brimming with opinions, leaving their celebrity "siblings" speechless and helpless.
 

 
Obedience? Not a chance.
 

 
"Foolish adults!"
 

 
One of the audience's favorite segments involved the program inviting the children's real parents to watch a live broadcast of the antics. The show would then film their reactions and interview them about their thoughts.
 

 
Netizens dubbed this segment ‘The Public Trial Hour.’
 

 
As Tong Zhao read through the project details, the personalities in her mental palace had mixed opinions:
 

 
Consort Chen: "Pass. Seeing children irritates me."
 

 
Back in her ancient world, Consort Chen's focus was entirely on winning favor. Pregnancy meant ten months of being unable to seek favor and the inevitable ruin of one's figure, so she had taken every measure to avoid it. Early on, many concubines with children had flaunted their kids to provoke her, causing endless annoyance.
 

 
The mothers would make snide remarks while their children delivered unfiltered jabs with their innocent words.
 

 
Both the mother and child assumed Consort Chen wouldn’t stoop to picking a fight with a child.
 

 
However, Consort Chen had her maid slap the concubine across the face before pinching the little prince's chubby cheeks and lifting his face until he could no longer shout insults like "vile fox spirit." She asked coldly, “Does His Highness think I don’t discipline children?”
 

 
Indeed, Consort Chen didn’t physically punish children. Instead, she had the little prince’s cheeks turn red from the pinch, then ensured the Emperor removed his name from the list of outings like hunts and excursions. As a final touch, she doubled the boy’s homework assignments.

Duan Ge: "I don’t have much experience dealing with kids either."
 

 
Shuyi: "I’m not interested, but if Tong Zhao needs me, I can endure it."
 

 
Both Shuyi and Han Zhi agreed on this, while Lu Xianzhang decided to retreat into seclusion.
 

 
If Tong Zhao was to appear on a variety show, she pragmatically wanted to choose one with the highest viewership.
 

 
Though she had become a legendary box office hitmaker, Tong Zhao acknowledged that luck played a part. There was no need to always gamble on niche or unpopular projects that others avoided.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll go alone for this one."
 

 
In her recovered memories, Tong Zhao couldn’t recall being particularly skilled at taking care of kids.
 

 
While she was absorbed in studying one of the proposals, Sister Chu peeked over her shoulder. “There’s a second page at the back. Aren’t you going to check it?”
 

 
“Oh, I forgot.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped to the second page.
 

 
Typically, the second page outlined the benefits and arrangements for the invited celebrity. For instance, the survival shows Tong Zhao had previously rejected detailed her role as either a dominant antagonist or a team leader. They even outlined specific scenarios designed to showcase her appeal and gain fans, with clear sincerity.
 

 
But when they reached the second page this time, both of them were stunned.
 

 
---
 

 
[Special Guest Role on ‘Baby Chaos’]
 

 
[The production team is impressed by Ms. Tong’s child model performance in ‘Neverland Girl’. They’d like to invite her to participate as a unique guest—disguised as a toddler named "Xiao Zhao" to join the group of children. Once in the immersive setting, all other participants’ memories of your real identity will be suppressed.]
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Is this even allowed?”
 

 
Sister Chu, recovering from her initial shock, laughed and said, “For others, no. But for you, absolutely. I remember now—they made a special childhood model for you in the movie, didn’t they? That adorable design won over a huge following. Tons of fans started calling you ‘Baby Zhao’ and wishing they could adopt you. They begged for you to perform a ‘return to childhood’ transformation.”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao mused silently—she wasn’t even old.
 

 
Hearing herself praised, the child version of Zhao, nicknamed “Baby Zhao,” peeked curiously from her mental palace. However, Consort Chen mercilessly pushed her back inside.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao could respond, Sister Chu stared at her head in amazement. “I don’t know how your brain works, Xiao Zhao. For most people, there’s always a slight disconnect between their holographic model and their real self—it feels awkward. But you? You can turn into a man or a child without the slightest sense of dissonance.”
 

 
“Is it really that awkward for others?”
 

 
“Of course.” Sister Chu shared an industry joke to explain.
 

 
Once, a male actor had a sudden whim and paid extra to a modeler, asking to add 5 cm to his holographic model.
 

 
The modeler asked, “Which part of you are we adding 5 cm to?”
 

 
The actor replied, “Can it be ‘everywhere’?”
 

 
The modeler said, “That’ll cost extra.”
 

 
In the end, the actor only increased his height by 5 cm.
 

 
But when filming began, he couldn’t handle it. His subconscious felt something was off everywhere, to the point where he started questioning the meaning of his existence. Ultimately, he had to pull his consciousness out and reshoot from scratch.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s eyes glimmered slightly as she listened to Sister Chu continue, “But don’t worry. There have been others with adaptability as strong as yours. Experts call this… something like ‘exceptionally wide brain capacity.’”
 

 
Wide brain capacity refers to individuals with extraordinarily high mental strength, according to the system’s perspective.
 

 
If the brain is seen as a bag, these people have massive bags capable of holding far more. However, to display the kind of dazzling and versatile abilities Tong Zhao has in immersive films, that bag must be filled with all kinds of rich life experiences. This isn’t something ordinary people can cultivate, and there’s no training school for it either.
 

 
Sister Chu explained all this to dispel any doubts Tong Zhao might have from hearing critics call her a “freak.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, unfazed, smirked faintly. “I’ll think it over and give my answer in three days.”
 

 
Sister Chu, ever confident in her decisions, simply told her to consider what type of film she’d want to do next.
 

 
Not much guidance there.
 

 
Tong Zhao noted the look of complete trust in Sister Chu’s eyes and thought, ‘At this rate, if I said I wanted to do a ridiculously melodramatic film about teenage heartbreak, with abortions and suicides, Sister Chu wouldn’t stop me either.’

In the mental palace:
 

 
Hearing Xiao Zhao being bullied by the Noble Consort, little Zhao puffed out her cheeks in frustration like a steamed bun. Meanwhile, the reclusive Lu Xianzhang, who had been pretending to meditate, emerged from his room and heroically sacrificed himself to distract the Noble Consort and draw her ire.
 

 
Xiao Zhao scurried behind Tong Zhao, her tiny legs moving quickly as she clung to her back, asking in a babyish voice, “Do lots of people really like me?”
 

 
“Yes, a lot of people say you’re adorable.”
 

 
And silly.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought privately.
 

 
“I heard that!” Xiao Zhao huffed.
 

 
“I’m sorry,” Tong Zhao replied. “I just didn’t expect I was like this as a child.”
 

 
Most people misunderstand what they were like as children. When their parents or elders reminisce about those days, they often look incredulous. Those with better family conditions might even have childhood videos, revealing moments they don’t remember at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so used to her calm, mature adult self that she’d assumed she’d always been that way.
 

 
Until she saw Xiao Zhao.
 

 
A walking, talking version of her younger self.
 

 
Xiao Zhao puffed up her cheeks indignantly. “I’m very calm and mature!”
 

 
“Mmhmm, sure,” Tong Zhao replied, patting her head. Her hair was soft and fine, like kitten fur. Little Zhao habitually nuzzled her hand, like a trusting little kitten-piglet. “So, do you want to go on the variety show as a little kid?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao nodded enthusiastically, as if her head were a bobblehead doll.
 

 
Afterward, she shyly twisted her fingers together and murmured, “I kind of want to play with the other kids...”
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly understood.
 

 
Every time a person grows, they say goodbye to their former self.
 

 
After being deceived and devastated by that scumbag of a man, she had killed off the naïve girl who once gave everything without reservation.
 

 
In adulthood, Tong Zhao excelled in every world she entered. Every persona she activated thrived in its own way, so much so that others rarely noticed any differences. But Xiao Zhao was unique—she represented the self that hadn’t yet had the chance to grow up. Her opportunities to come out and play were few and far between.
 

 
Realizing this, Tong Zhao’s heart softened completely. She felt like an indulgent adult who had traveled back in time and was now spoiling her childhood self senseless.
 

 
“Alright, we’ll let a whole group of kids play with Xiao Zhao.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao beamed with joy and planted a happy kiss on her cheek.
 

 
From somewhere nearby, the Noble Consort spoke wistfully, “I want a group of handsome men to play with me too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended not to hear, tidied up, and climbed into bed to sleep.
 

 
---
 

 
The director of ‘Baby Chaos’ was overjoyed to learn Tong Zhao had agreed to appear as a guest. After some discussion, they decided to keep her role as a “special kid participant” a secret to maximize the surprise effect when the episode aired. They only announced that Tong Zhao would be joining the show.
 

 
The program already had high viewership, but the announcement caused an uproar online.
 

 
[Tong Zhao is practically a baby herself. How can she take care of other babies? I’m worried, QAQ.]
 

 
The wave of “mom fans” hadn’t even subsided when another post gained traction:
 

 
[What do you mean, ‘baby’? Keep in mind that Sister Zhao has a martial arts background. I’m looking forward to her tearing into some bratty kids on the show!]
 

 
As discussions heated up, the official ‘Baby Chaos’ account dropped a bombshell:
 

 
> @BabyChaos: Announcing another guest, @Jiang Dang.
 

 
No one expected this—what a dream team!
 

 
Netizens were stunned.
 

 
Although ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ had wrapped up its theatrical run some time ago, people's perception of time regarding major internet events tends to be blurry. Besides, Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were essentially the same person, and Shi Qianqiu was the director—so in the eyes of fans, Tong Zhao’s most “official” on-screen couple was Jiang Dang.
 

 
This held true despite the fact that Tong Zhao’s boyfriend in the film was played by another actor.
 

 
However, it was Jiang Dang who reaped the CP (couple pairing) popularity benefits alongside Tong Zhao. It just goes to show how unpredictable things can be—artists who know how to stir the pot always end up benefiting.
 

 
[OMG, OMG! Can you imagine the two of them raising a kid together? A preview of their future family of three!]
 

 
[Are you sure the producers trust Jiang Dang with a kid? Let’s be real, if he doesn’t lose himself, it’ll already be a miracle.]
 

 
[Can Jiang Dang even survive without his assistant and manager? /doge emoji]
 

 
This wasn’t just blind trolling—he had a track record.
 

 
During a promotional event, Jiang Dang was allowed to take a short break. He decided to wander around nearby, only for his phone to get stolen. As he wandered aimlessly, he ended up getting lost. Eventually, he had to ask a passerby for help, and when they recognized him, a crowd quickly formed, three layers deep, all recording him on their phones and demanding a live rendition of one of his viral earworm songs.
 

 
Instead, all they captured was his pitiful, downcast expression as he stood there helpless.
 

 
A 6-foot-tall, handsome man, reduced to looking like a lost kindergarten boy. Netizens found it hysterical.
 

 
But just two weeks later, he released a new pop song about feeling like an outsider searching for his identity. The music video featured his brooding, indifferent aesthetic, which swept across the internet, erasing the “silly rich boy” image completely. The plan had worked flawlessly!
 

 
CP fans were ecstatic, seeing it as the ultimate fanservice.
 

 
Historically, ‘Baby Chaos’ had segments involving interactions between “parent” pairs. If the episode’s lineup of child guests wasn’t extensive, it wasn’t unusual for two celebrities to share the responsibility of caring for one child.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t the only ones causing a stir. Other netizens, just looking for drama, egged the show on:
 

 
[Pair up Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao to take care of a kid—that would be EPIC! Producers, don’t miss this chance!]
 

 
Meanwhile, both individual fanbases retreated to their own corners, firmly refusing to support any forced pairing.
 

 
The already popular show reached new heights of anticipation. The producers, delighted by the soaring buzz and skyrocketing search data, were over the moon.
 

 
When Tong Zhao heard the news, she was a little surprised, wondering if Jiang Dang had agreed to the show because of her.
 

 
The Noble Consort asked how she felt about it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, responded, “Don’t you already know exactly how I feel? I’m just surprised, that’s all.”
 

 
To be honest, she didn’t feel much of anything.
 

 
She neither disliked the idea of being linked with him nor felt flattered by it.
 

 
The former was because she had also used him once, leveraging his name as a shield when selecting the male lead for a film. The latter was because Jiang Dang was an enigmatic character. While he had made his feelings for her quite clear, he hadn’t lingered around or followed up, keeping a certain mystique.
 

 
Perhaps an artist’s version of “liking someone” is just this unpredictable.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t dwell on it.
 

 
What she didn’t expect was that less than an hour after the announcement was made on the official account, Jiang Dang sent her a message asking if they could grab a meal together.
 

 
A meal?
 

 
His message was a voice note. That distinctive, deep voice of his carried the invitation, making her ears tingle as if kissed by the wind. His tone was perfectly normal—neither overly formal nor casual—just a simple, straightforward question.
 

 
Blame it on his incredible voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt it was her own overthinking and responded with a voice message:
 

 
“Before or after filming? What are we eating? Ugh, ever since becoming a celebrity, even grabbing a meal with friends has become a challenge. But if we’re really doing this, we should pick a place with good privacy…”
 

 
The Noble Consort chimed in: “A handsome guy invites you to dinner, and you’re worried about what to eat and when to eat? You’re something else.”
 

 
Zhao Zai (Xiao Zai) peeked in curiously: “Then what should I be concerned about?”
 

 
The Noble Consort replied smugly: “You should check if it coincides with your cycle—”
 

 
“Hey! Why are you shoving me?”
 

 
To stop the Noble Consort from corrupting the child with inappropriate comments, the Immortal Master pulled her into his room.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t oblivious; she’d considered plenty.
 

 
A man and a woman dining alone—if it wasn’t for work, it definitely meant something.
 

 
Maybe it was her upbringing, but Tong Zhao was rather indifferent when it came to relationships.
 

 
During her time as the Noble Consort, she’d been at her peak in terms of liking men.
 

 
Now that she was back to being herself, surrounded by beautiful men and women alike, she found herself feeling indifferent toward anyone.
 

 
Recently, Jiang Dang hadn’t contacted her much. When he did, it was always proper and work-related. Tong Zhao suspected he might not mean anything by it.
 

 
But before she could overthink, Jiang Dang’s reply came almost immediately after her message was sent—three voice notes in quick succession:
 

 
“Anything is fine. I can work around your schedule.”
 

 
“Let’s eat whatever you feel like eating.”
 

 
“Friends grabbing a meal?”
 

 
The last one ended with a fleeting, low chuckle.
 

 
It sounded like he didn’t just want to be friends.
# Chapter117
Unconsciously, Tong Zhao raised her hand to scratch her ear.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was perfectly normal—he wasn’t being overly flirty or calling her pet names. Yet that low, unhurried rhythm in his voice seemed to brush against her eardrums, leaving them tingling. This man didn’t need any extraordinary talent to be a singer. His natural musical gift was just icing on the cake. Even if he sat there with a guitar and hummed some out-of-tune melody, it would still be a soul-stirring serenade.
 

 
She was momentarily dazed when her phone suddenly rang.
 

 
The caller ID read: Jiang Dang.
 

 
Consort Chen: "I like him—if you like him too, you should go for it."
 

 
Shuyi chuckled: "You're just still bitter that Little Kai didn’t understand the situation last time and ended up helping his rival."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Tch."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Placing my bets now!"
 

 
Her inner consciousness had turned into a stock market of speculation.
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored them, steadied herself, and picked up the call. She greeted him with a simple "Hello." He got straight to the point.
 

 
"Sending messages back and forth might miss your reaction." His sentences were short and clipped, likely a habit from his singing career. Even in conversation, there was a rhythm, with light and heavy tones alternating naturally. "I wanted to call and talk to you," he added with a laugh, "because I couldn’t wait to hear your voice—it’s so pleasant."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled slightly. "How could I dare think my voice sounds good in front of you?"
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, "I thought about calling you on video, but that might not be appropriate."
 

 
Fair enough—it would have been a bit abrupt.
 

 
Tong Zhao found herself surprised at how socially adept he was.
 

 
Jiang Dang continued, "After this meal, we’ll count as friends. Next time, I’ll call you on video."
 

 
...
 

 
Well, now—was this a gradual progression tactic?
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing but wasn’t particularly averse to the idea of a video call. After all, he was a very attractive man, and she wasn’t the type to clam up in front of a camera.
 

 
"Sure, why not?"
 

 
She opened her calendar and shared six days she had available, leaving the choice up to him. When it came to deciding what to eat, she couldn’t make up her mind. Jiang Dang suggested coming over to her place and cooking for her.
 

 
"Do you cook?" she asked, genuinely surprised. Would he blow up her kitchen?
 

 
Jiang Dang reassured her, "I do. When I lack inspiration, I cook or do housework. Baking helps me calm my mind."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She was genuinely curious about what Jiang Dang could whip up in the kitchen. Judging by his current approach—actively pursuing her and showing sincerity—the goodwill he’d built up over time was enough for her to give him a chance to show off his skills. As for whether it was safe for the two of them to be alone, she figured if it came down to a fight, he’d be the one worrying about personal safety, not her.
 

 
They set the dinner date for three days before the filming of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
In the meantime, Tong Zhao, enjoying her vacation, leisurely played games at home.
 

 
For her fans, who had been eagerly waiting, she decided to open a livestream.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao had been too busy with work to play games with Wei Zekai. But now, when she logged in, she saw a string of new skin gift packs and a barrage full of lemon emojis. Some fans were envious of the gifts she had received, while others were jealous of Wei Zekai having the special "Zhao Zhao’s Friend" badge. They also wanted to send skins to Tong Zhao.
 

 
"Not for free, I have to carry him to rank up," Tong Zhao said with a smile as she and Wei Zekai played five rounds together, and as expected, they won all of them.
 

 
Afterward, some fans intentionally queued up against her. Some helped by giving her resources, while others maliciously stole her minions for experience. Tong Zhao was unfazed, playing calmly as always. However, Wei Zekai talked a lot in the voice chat.
 

 
"Let's end the stream here," Tong Zhao glanced at the bottom right corner of her screen. "I have a dinner appointment with a friend."
 

 
The barrage immediately flooded with questions asking who the friend was, male or female.
 

 
Some viewers joked that Wei Zekai was in danger.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was also watching Tong Zhao’s stream, noticed the comment and, looking puzzled, asked, "Why am I in danger?"
 

 
[Do you know who she’s having dinner with?]
 

 
"I don't know! What does it matter who she's having dinner with?" Wei Zekai replied, genuinely confused.
 

 
He and Tong Zhao had a very close relationship, but he didn’t think she needed to report to him about having dinner with someone else!
 

 
[Oh wow, didn’t expect Wei Zekai to have a mature side.]
 

 
[What do you know, this is the calmness of the main wife!]
 

 
It was indeed very calm.
 

 
Then, an SVIP user sent a barrage of colorful comments:
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu]
 

 
……
 

 
"Tong Zhao, you’re having dinner with Shi Qianqiu???"
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned. "Huh?"
 

 
The barrage exploded in laughter.
 

 
This reminded viewers of a story:
 

 
Why would an old farmer, who is willing to donate one hundred acres of land and one million to the country, refuse to donate a cow? Because he actually has a cow.
 

 
Why is Wei Zekai so mature and generous?
 

 
Because he hasn't faced reality.
 

 
[He’s panicking, he’s panicking, he’s panicking!]
 

 
"What does this have to do with Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao, still puzzled, turned off the livestream.
 

 
When the livestream blacked out and everything went silent, the audience in the barrage got anxious and began calling for her not to end it, wanting to hear more. However, it was no use. Some viewers checked both of their game IDs, only to find that they were offline. Left halfway through the gossip, the audience resorted to chatting in the barrage, speculating that Wei Zekai seemed to have strong opinions about Director Shi Qianqiu and didn’t seem to like him.
 

 
[Isn't it normal to dislike the old thief Shi?]
 

 
[Yeah, didn’t you all see the interview for the movie premiere? Shi Qianqiu’s ending for Nie Su was so real, it felt like a social revenge story. I wish the authors I follow weren’t so heartless like him. I don’t want to see harsh reality; I just want to eat small sweet buns qwq]
 

 
[Honestly, I want to see a drama unfold.]
 

 
Some viewers even went to Weibo to ask Shi Qianqiu directly.
 

 
Some asked if it was true that he was having dinner with Tong Zhao, while others speculated that Wei Zekai might be jealous and wondered how he would respond.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu actually replied.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v: [The movie ‘Neverland Girl’ has finished screening.]
 

 
What does that mean?
 

 
They didn’t even ask about the movie. Was he replying to the wrong comment?
 

 
After reflecting, the viewers figured it out. Turns out, the previous rumors about him and Tong Zhao were just promotional stunts for the movie. Now that the movie was done, there was no need to make money off tickets, and the plastic CP had expired, no need to mention it anymore.
 

 
[Wow, what a realistic man.]
 

 
[Turns out, I’ve been supporting the wrong person.]
 

 
The viewers felt that Shi Qianqiu was cold and indifferent, while he probably just found all the drama amusing.
 

 
It was the middle of winter in China, and he’d taken a long vacation, heading to the southern hemisphere for a trip.
 

 
＊
 

 
After filming the music video in the snow, Jiang Dang worked non-stop for 36 hours. He didn’t sleep well on the plane either, and when he got off the flight, he felt dazed. Normally a bit slow, with a hat and mask on, only his deep, penetrating eyes were visible. His new assistant thought he was in a bad mood, so during the drive to his destination, the assistant didn’t speak to him and didn’t dare to play any music.
 

 
So sleepy...
 

 
It was about time for him to feel tired.
 

 
The director had made him retake so many shots to match the mood of the song. With his head leaning against the window, his cold eyes looked as if he were plotting something bad, but in reality, he was about to doze off.
 

 
“If you're tired, Brother Dong, you can take a nap. I drive very steadily,” the assistant kindly suggested.
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head. “I’m too awake to sleep.”
 

 
The assistant, seeing his heavy eyelids in the rearview mirror, felt like he was redefining what "awake" meant.
 

 
Thinking about finally seeing Tong Zhao soon, Jiang Dang immediately felt awake again.
 

 
He propped his eyelids up and, to stay alert, lightly hummed a song.
 

 
After a while, the assistant, a little embarrassed, interrupted him. “Brother, your singing is so good and so moving, but if you keep singing, I’m going to get sleepy too.”
 

 
The driver definitely couldn’t fall asleep.
 

 
Jiang Dang was always easygoing, and immediately switched to a new song, softly and mournfully improvising a rearranged version of ‘I Come From the Grassland’. The new assistant almost had a mental breakdown listening to it.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Do you think it sounds good?"
 

 
Assistant: "Yeah... it sounds good..."
 

 
"How specifically does it sound good?"
 

 
"It’s very... grassland-y, bro."
 

 
Basically, it’s very grassy.
 

 
Jiang Dang laughed, singing all the way to the ‘Yu Long Xuan’ (a place). He switched to a song from ‘Initial D’ halfway through—’Drift’—and got the assistant so hyped up that the car sped up significantly. Only when they reached Yu Long Xuan and saw the security guard who was nearly two meters tall did the assistant finally calm down.
 

 
After dropping the assistant off, Jiang Dang entered the elevator that went directly to his unit and entered the code.
 

 
The elevator was very quiet, except for his heartbeat, which felt loud.
 

 
Thump, thump, thump, thump...
 

 
He raised a hand to his chest, trying to get it to beat in rhythm.
 

 
But the heartbeat didn’t follow his will, and even top-tier singers couldn’t control it. The "god of song" failed. The elevator made a "ding" sound as the door opened. Jiang Dang thought about his earlier actions and suddenly found it a bit amusing, curling his lips into a slight smile.
 

 
When he entered the community, Tong Zhao received the message. As soon as the elevator door opened, she went to the hallway to greet him.
 

 
"You’re here."
 

 
His mask covered the lower half of his face, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see his smile, only a pair of eyes that looked dangerously charming. For a moment, she thought he was going to push her against the wall and kiss her...
 

 
Of course, that didn’t happen.
 

 
Jiang Dang swiftly removed his hat and mask, his eyes shining brightly as he looked at her.
 

 
He took a step forward... then another...
 

 
And then, he knelt down.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "...Huh?"
 

 
What is he doing?!
 

 
Why is he giving such a huge gesture for no reason?
 

 
She would have been less surprised if he had pushed her against the wall and kissed her.
 

 
Jiang Dang supported himself against the wall, his voice faint but tinged with a hint of grievance: "I’m so tired..."
 

 
He had been holding it together, but once he saw Tong Zhao, the excitement that had been keeping him going just broke, and his legs went soft. Tong Zhao helped him to the sofa, poured him a cup of warm water, and when she placed it on the coffee table, she realized he had already fallen asleep, his eyelashes casting a small, fan-shaped shadow. He looked like the villainous final boss in a mobile game, even sleeping like a bad guy.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s schedule was easy to check. Tong Zhao asked his agent a couple of questions and soon found out that he had been running himself ragged.
 

 
During the promotional tour for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Jiang Dang was always the one who loved sleep the most. His sleep time was squeezed by the busy promotional schedule, and he always looked gloomy with a heavy, low-pressure mood. However, he never took out his frustration on anyone and obediently followed the schedule.
 

 
Tong Zhao stood by the sofa for a moment, thinking, then decided to carry him to the guest room, tuck him in, turn off the lights, and go to the study to continue her meditation and training.
 

 
Jiang Dang slept all the way through until the next morning.
 

 
When he woke up in an unfamiliar environment, he was initially disoriented, unsure of where or when he was. After a moment, he regained his bearings and accepted his confusion calmly. After washing up in the guest room's private bathroom, he slowly walked out to the living room, where he saw Tong Zhao using the treadmill by the floor-to-ceiling window. He greeted her:
 

 
"Have you had breakfast? If not, I’ll go make it."
 

 
Jiang Dang hadn’t forgotten that his purpose for coming was to have a meal together.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded, pointing him toward the open kitchen.
 

 
Bathing in the morning sunlight, Tong Zhao was dressed in tight workout clothes that accentuated her graceful figure. Jiang Dang didn’t look at her much and went straight to the kitchen, as though he was really just there to cook.
 

 
The fridge was well-stocked with ingredients.
 

 
Tong Zhao ran with her back to the room, listening to the rhythmic sounds of Jiang Dang preparing food: chopping on the cutting board, turning on the stove, pouring oil, and stir-frying. Everything was organized and orderly. Even though she didn’t look back, Tong Zhao believed that he really knew how to cook.
 

 
Even if his cooking skills were average, she would pretend it tasted delicious, considering the effort he put in.
 

 
After finishing her workout, Tong Zhao took a shower and changed clothes. When she came out, she saw the table full of prepared dishes. They weren’t necessarily gourmet, but they looked decent. To her surprise, they tasted quite normal—just like a home-cooked breakfast.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I don’t usually make dishes like this."
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: "Seems like you really enjoy cooking."
 

 
"I do," he replied.
 

 
When it came to the incident where he had gotten so tired he kneeled last night, Jiang Dang just said straight out: "On the plane and in the car, I kept thinking about seeing you next. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. Then, when I finally saw you, I was so happy that my mind went blank and I almost blacked out."
 

 
He sighed: "These dishes don’t even showcase my cooking skills..."
 

 
Tong Zhao became more interested when she heard this. Since she had nothing else to do all day, she didn’t mind waiting for another meal later.
 

 
Jiang Dang, hearing her interest, laughed and happily said he would make her lunch.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao thought about it, she could only say that trouble came from her own words.
 

 
After breakfast, they played some games in the game room. Jiang Dang wasn’t good at shooting games. When they played ‘PUBG’, he would randomly wander off, fall behind, and get distracted by collecting trash. Tong Zhao told him not to bother with the useless stuff, but he kept promising and then died in strange places. After that, she went over to rummage through his loot box—
 

 
Turns out, it was full of garbage.
 

 
Compared to his terrible ‘PUBG’ skills, Jiang Dang was much better at playing the support role in ‘MOBA’ games. Not only did he have great map awareness, but he could also execute perfect team fights in the most bizarre ways, outsmarting the enemy with ease.
 

 
Tong Zhao observed for a while and noticed that his hero pool in ‘Honor of Kings’ included Lu Ban Master, Guiguzi, and Da Qiao. In ‘League of Legends’, it was Thresh, Bard, and Rakan—all heroes that, when played well, could carry the game, but when played poorly, could end up helping the enemy team instead. As she played, she did a psychological profile of him in her head.
 

 
He was a support player with a lot of creativity and imagination. He seemed clueless and naive, but in reality, he had strong control and aggression. As soon as the enemy made a small positioning mistake, he would seize the opportunity to deal a lot of damage. After he wore them down, the enemy's support and ADC would be completely suppressed, unable to do anything for the rest of the match.
 

 
Some people had already lost the lane, but the game didn’t really end until the crystal exploded.
 

 
He needed to control the situation, especially wanting to set the pace of the game.
 

 
He also liked to silently taunt the opponents, flashing emotes or signs to annoy them.
 

 
The more she watched, the more she felt that he resembled an animal.
 

 
When she saw him play a support hero and toy with the enemy's low-health carry, giving them hope and then delivering the finishing blow, followed by an emote on the enemy’s corpse, she finally remembered what kind of animal he reminded her of—
 

 
It was an orca!
 

 
Seemingly cute and clumsy, but actually very ruthless and loves to play with its prey.
 

 
With a single flick of its tail, it knocks out a seal, waits for it to wake up, then slaps it again and swallows it like a pancake.
 

 
The enemy ADC was furious, thinking he was a female player since he was playing Janna, a female champion, and called him a "bitch."
 

 
[Everyone] Jungle, do something! (Storm Spirit): *Whining sound*
 

 
...
 

 
How annoying!
 

 
That's right, orcas also make a whining sound.
 

 
After playing for three hours, Jiang Dang said he was going to prepare food. Tong Zhao was a little confused about why it would take so long to prepare a meal, but she didn’t stop him. She nodded and went to the study to work on the script. Even just reading the synopses of all the scripts Sister Chu had given her would take a long time.
 

 
...
 

 
"The meal is ready.”
 

 
With breakfast as a prelude, Tong Zhao felt fairly confident about Jiang Dang's cooking.
 

 
When she saw the dishes on the table, she was a bit surprised.
 

 
It was clear that Jiang Dang had put in some serious effort. The dishes were elegantly presented on large porcelain plates, aiming for the look of a Michelin-star restaurant.
 

 
She smiled and sat down. "You're really good at cooking."
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up a small tomato that looked like an appetizer.
 

 
When she bit into it, something felt off.
 

 
The inside of the tomato had been hollowed out and filled with meat juice and king oyster mushrooms. The combination achieved a balance of sweet and sour on the outside, and savory on the inside. The skin was cool, while the filling was hot.
 

 
Next, she ate what appeared to be a pie.
 

 
The jelly-like substance on the pie crust was transparent, but when it entered her mouth, it was unmistakably mango-flavored.
 

 
Finally, Tong Zhao thought the pasta was the main course, but it was actually made of chocolate.
 

 
And there was a sunny-side-up egg.
 

 
You'd think it was an egg, right?
 

 
No, the yolk was made of mango, and the egg white was specially treated cream.
 

 
Jiang Dang rested his chin on his hand, staring at her intently with his beautifully expressive eyes, not even blinking, full of anticipation. Tong Zhao knew how much effort had gone into preparing these unusual dishes, so out of courtesy, she ate everything.
 

 
To be honest, it wasn’t bad.
 

 
But after finishing this meal, the trust between people had clearly been shattered.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked her for her thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave her review: "Seeing the mountain isn’t seeing the mountain, seeing the water isn’t seeing the water."
 

 
Jiang Dang took it as a compliment, his eyes narrowing as he smiled, looking inexplicably happy, as if he was about to make a pleased "whining" sound…
 

 
Wait, she really did make him sound like an orca.
 

 
After the meal, Tong Zhao thought he would say something, but he didn’t.
 

 
She told him to just put the dirty dishes in the kitchen; there would be a cleaner coming regularly to take care of it.
 

 
Tong Zhao had all kinds of musical instruments at home. Jiang Dang performed a personal concert for her, then said he had to go for another engagement, leaving without doing or saying anything else.
 

 
The song he sang was quite nice, with a catchy, slightly addictive melody.
 

 
She wanted to download it, but couldn't find it online.
 

 
Two days later, Jiang Dang's official company-managed account posted a snippet from one of his new album singles for listening, and it was the exact same song he had sung for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The comments were full of praise: "Wow, so dedicated! He remembered to release a song before going on the variety show, a brand-new single we've never heard before!"
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had already heard it two days ago.
 

 
@Jiang Dangv: "Encrypted Love”
 

 
---
 

 
On the third day, after enjoying a relaxing break, Tong Zhao packed up and headed to the filming location.
 

 
Zhao Zai was quite excited, running around in the palace of her consciousness.
 

 
This made Consort Chen a bit annoyed, so she suggested, "Why don't I take over? I won't play the child, I'll play the parent. I could steal away all the fathers and give the children a brand-new stepmother."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "I advise the Consort to be kind."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so anxious that she slapped her knee.
 

 
Consort Chen was joking, and Tong Zhao didn’t take it seriously. The production team had used her childhood modeling from ‘Neverland Girl’, and after placing Zhao Zai into the main personality’s role, she closed her eyes.
 

 
Her consciousness sank deep into a very profound place.
# Chapter118
"Baby Chaos" is a live-streamed variety show based on instincts.
 

 
After all the guests’ consciousness enters the modeling of the holographic space, the live broadcast from the outside world also enters its countdown phase.
 

 
The host introduces the big guest of this episode.
 

 
Jiang Dang was given a lot of attention in the promotional materials.
 

 
After all, in recent years, whenever he releases a song, it becomes a hit. His songs are heard everywhere, on the streets and alleys, and also on platforms like Kuaishou and Douyin.
 

 
The funniest part is that some listeners look down on him, thinking that all his songs are just catchy pop tunes, calling them overly commercial. They think that an original musician named "Si Bian" is the real artist with true aspirations... But just before New Year's Eve, it was revealed that Si Bian's account was actually Jiang Dang's alternate account, where he posted niche, experimental music that was hard to recognize at first due to the subtle tuning of his voice.
 

 
He has the face of an idol, but does the work of a pure creative artist.
 

 
[With a fanbase like his, it might be better to put him in the small guest category. I’m really worried about him taking care of the kid…]
 

 
[Fortunately, it's an instinctive variety show, so even if things aren’t handled perfectly, nothing major will happen.]
 

 
[Your song "Encrypted Love Words" went viral on Douyin again. I get on the subway for work, and someone is blasting it over the speakers. It actually sounds pretty good.]
 

 
The second guest, Zhang Shi, is subconsciously seen in the industry as the "honest guy professional." Many viewers, when they see his face, immediately think his wife has either already cheated on him or is about to. He’s been labeled as someone born to wear the “green hat” (a Chinese metaphor for being cheated on)—
 

 
No one likes to hear such evaluations, but because of this unremarkable feature, he has gained many performance opportunities, standing out among the "honest guys," and earned his first pot of gold. Therefore, he often says that he doesn’t mind.
 

 
At the age of 35, Zhang Shi is still single.
 

 
There are rumors in the industry that when he was filming an instinctive movie, after repeatedly being "cheated on," he was unable to approach relationships anymore. In fact, this is true. He has sought help from professional psychologists, and the doctor suggested that since this has affected the trajectory of his life, he should switch to a different kind of role.
 

 
However, in the projects that invited him, playing the “honest guy” is the highest-paying role.
 

 
Between money and marriage, Zhang Shi, who still harbors lingering fears about the latter, decisively transformed his sorrow and anger into strength, walking further and further down the "honest guy" path. The gimmick for this appearance on the show was also "This might be the only chance for the audience to see Zhang Shi taking care of a child," and the most popular comment on that Weibo post was—
 

 
[So, he's not even taking care of his own kid?]
 

 
That comment went viral and was liked until next year.
 

 
The third guest, female artist Long Fei, is always full of energy. Her team has her show up in grand fashion at every event. Her flaw has always been overdoing it—she tries too hard to outshine everyone else. For this show, she even had a press release claiming she was going to compete with Tong Zhao in terms of looks.
 

 
The fourth guest, Xie Zihan, is interesting. She’s a trainee who came from a talent show. After debuting at a high rank, she immediately felt a huge sense of disparity. During the competition, she already felt the intense competition, but after debuting and competing in the entire entertainment industry, she immediately realized how cruel and unfair life could be. She then obediently followed the company's orders, listened closely to her manager, and because her face resembled Tong Zhao’s to some degree, and she was especially good at sports, being surprisingly strong and agile among female idols, the press started calling her “Little Tong Zhao.”
 

 
In fact, the two have some background.
 

 
Xie Zihan debuted through the talent show "Star Selection Girls," the same season as Xu Zhu.
 

 
Her manager put a lot of effort into arranging this appearance on the show, hoping she could ride on Tong Zhao’s popularity.
 

 
"Fifth guest, Ye Fanxiao, from 'Dancing Youth Team,' who previously starred in a campus superpower-themed instinctive TV drama…"
 

 
The introduction continued for a while.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao, like Xie Zihan, also debuted through a talent show.
 

 
However, he was luckier. After debuting, he landed a role in a supernatural idol drama. Although due to limited funding, they chose a much cheaper traditional drama, it still gained some attention in a small scope. After all, the short clips from the drama that were widely shared on Weibo couldn't have been all holographic.
 

 
With the support of his fans, Ye Fanxiao landed a role in a relatively high-investment instinctive movie. Though not the lead, he played the second male lead. The movie’s promotion happened to overlap with "Neverland Girl," so he was included in all the promotional announcements, getting a lot of exposure, which led to this individual booking for the holographic variety show.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao’s public persona is proud and cold.
 

 
His subconscious personality is reserved, a bit of a "chuunibyou" (youthful delusion), and he loves to act cool. The characters he plays fit the mold perfectly…
 

 
The bullet comments exploded.
 

 
It wasn’t because Ye Fanxiao’s momentum was strong or his fame was high.
 

 
Half of the guests for "Baby Chaos" had been announced, while the other half had not.
 

 
The audience watching the live stream was waiting for Tong Zhao to appear, thinking it was normal for her to be the final guest, given her status.
 

 
But as they kept waiting…
 

 
All the big guests had already been introduced??
 

 
They introduced the small guest!
 

 
Where’s Tong Zhao?
 

 
The official Weibo promoted Tong Zhao so heavily, where did she go?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were the first to get upset.
 

 
After all, the official Weibo had promoted Tong Zhao, so her fans naturally worked hard to promote ‘Baby Chaos’, spreading the word and recommending it everywhere. Generally speaking, the first half of the live-streamed instinctive variety show is free, to attract viewers. Fans didn’t think too much about it—if they said their "sister" would appear, they just directly bought the viewing rights without hesitation.
 

 
They had paid and put in the effort.
 

 
But now the host is saying there's no Tong Zhao?
 

 
This vague and misleading promotion to gain fans is even worse. No fan would tolerate it. Even though Tong Zhao's fans were usually laid-back, they flooded the official comment section with criticism, and most bystanders could understand why. Lying is unethical, and fans had paid money specifically for Tong Zhao—this is false advertising.
 

 
Girls in fan circles, aside from anything else, are really fast at typing.
 

 
A massive barrage of question marks flooded the entire screen, which was quite spectacular.
 

 
Audience members who had been paying attention to the pre-show promotions could already feel the storm brewing from the fans' anger. Some fans of Ye Fanxiao, who were more observant, quietly kept their mouths shut, not daring to appear too happy in the comments. They murmured to themselves...
 

 
“Is our brother going to replace Xiao Zhao’s position?”
 

 
“No way, right? He’s not that good, is he?”
 

 
“If he were that good, wouldn’t our Fan Shao have been placed at the center position a long time ago? He should’ve debuted with a clear lead!”

The anger reached its peak, and just as the fans were about to unleash a barrage of insults aimed at the show’s director…
 

 
The live-stream screen showed a fair, smooth sleeping face.
 

 
The big guests and small guests had different starting points.
 

 
The big guests were in a living room with sofas and coffee tables.
 

 
The small guest’s starting point looked like a kindergarten playroom, with soft woolen mats covering the floor. Colorful pillows were stacked into small mountains, and even the corners of a one-meter-high bookshelf were padded for safety.
 

 
A little girl, around six years old, was lying on her side on the pillow mountain.
 

 
The girl’s jet-black long hair was spread behind her, and her soft, pink little face looked like a glutinous rice ball. Her rosy, plump lips were like jelly, and she looked so delicious. When the camera zoomed in, her long, curled eyelashes fluttered, and this angelic sleeping face made even the most furious fans hesitate for a moment before pressing the send button on the comments, afraid of disturbing the little angel’s sleep…
 

 
However, there was another layer to this.
 

 
This… this… this…
 

 
Isn’t this just ‘Xiao Zhao’s’ character from ‘Neverland Girl’?
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans and the audience's minds went blank, and in an instant, the comments section was flooded with thousands of exclamations.
 

 
Some fans, too quick to react, sent out insults but quickly corrected themselves with lightning-fast fingers.
 

 
As a result, the comments turned into a chorus of "realizing" moments:
 

 
[The show team is treating us like fools!]
 

 
[How could anyone come up with such a genius move? Amazing! Love you, mom, mua.]
 

 
[Director Sima, come out here!]
 

 
[Flatter me! ps. Sima refers to the director, not Sima Yi.]
 

 
[Take out my Italian cannon!]
 

 
[Let's set off some fireworks for the director of the show to cheer him up!]
 

 
This drifting speed—if Takumi Fujiwara were here, he’d have to bow in respect.
 

 
Who could watch this and not say that Sichuan Opera’s face-changing technique is really amazing?
 

 
The barrage of comments about face-changing stunned other viewers, with quick-handed fans taking screenshots and posting them on Weibo to share with friends, all laughing together. Netizens who understood the situation were also very sympathetic, joking about [the director’s mom being pushed to the Naihe Bridge, with fans performing a dramatic scene of pulling her back from the underworld after spitting out the Meng Po soup, treating her like royalty at a lavish banquet]. Some said the production team deserved the criticism, but it was definitely part of their promotional strategy—creating a twist to generate buzz and topic heat.
 

 
Then, netizens started wondering: ‘How did Tong Zhao turn into a little kid?’
 

 
Of course, fans rushed to explain.
 

 
---
 

 
“Guest #1, Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“In reality, she’s a famous actress with box office earnings in the billions. She became famous at a young age and has more fame and experience than her peers. She’s been surrounded by scandals and was once a controversial figure, holding the top spot on Baidu's female celebrity index for an entire year.”
 

 
“With the help of a time machine, she’s turned back into a little child and is now joining our list of guests.”
 

 
“The production team has adjusted her age with some technical tricks, but her subconscious is uncontrollable. When this little angel with a sweet face wakes up, what kind of surprises will she bring to our show?”
 

 
As the host's introduction ended, he said, “Let’s gather 10,000 likes to wake Xiao Zhao up!”
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, a button appeared on the live stream.
 

 
This interactive segment was one of the highlights of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
Having a "cloud" interaction with a little glutinous rice ball was an unimaginable joy!
 

 
With the sound effect of [deng deng deng deng deng], the like bar quickly filled up and overflowed.
 

 
A cute version of Mickey Mouse’s hand appeared out of nowhere in the air and gently poked Xiao Zhao’s cheek.
 

 
Her cotton-candy-like cheek dented slightly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao, poked in her sleep, furrowed her brows and pouted her soft lips.
 

 
The white hand was about to poke again when Xiao Zhao flipped over, burying her cheek into the pillow, refusing to be poked.
 

 
However, the merciless production team poked her on the back of the head.
 

 
Xiao Zhao mumbled something in her sleep, and due to being unclear, the audience only heard a very sweet-sounding "um-mee."
 

 
[Awsl—! Medic! Where’s the medic?]
 

 
[I want her to keep sleeping, but I also want to poke her and see her reaction. I’m a sinner!]
 

 
[I’m saving this episode to watch over and over again, ahhhh, I hate it, when will they release a pet like Xiao Zhao? I want to raise her, qwq.]
 

 
The entire barrage was filled with fans wanting to "cloud-raise" Xiao Zhao.
 

 
When the production team saw that the cuteness was working, they really flipped Xiao Zhao over and twisted her cheek.
 

 
They twisted it hard, lifting one side of her tofu-like cheek upward.
 

 
The audience was shocked to discover that the tofu had turned into soft, chewy, rice cake-like skin—
 

 
[Excuse me, should we increase the intensity?]
 

 
[Yes/No].
# Chapter119
[Yes/No]
 

 
Xiao Zhao is so cute, how can they bully her!
 

 
This is what the barrage is saying.
 

 
However, in reality, the number of votes for [Yes] skyrocketed at an unbelievable speed.
 

 
Generally speaking, in interactive variety shows like this, the fans of the guests would coordinate their actions to ensure the maximum benefit for their beloved star.
 

 
But...
 

 
[No no no, poking Xiao Zhao's face hurts the mother's heart.]
 

 
[What does flipping my child over mean?! Let her sleep if she's tired!]
 

 
[This is too cruel, are you still human? Press 'Yes' hard!]
 

 
[Will she cry? Press 'Yes' if she will cry, and press 'Yes' even if she won’t /dog head.]
 

 
— Xiao Zhao's cloud mommy and cloud daddy can't come to an agreement!
 

 
The fake hand in the air poked Xiao Zhao’s face again.
 

 
She still kept her eyes closed, but raised her hand and waved it in the air, surprisingly managing to grab the finger of that annoying fake hand with her round Doraemon hand.
 

 
#Clever Xiao Zhao refusing to get out of bed.#
 

 
[Hahahaha, she's the smartest baby to her mommy!]
 

 
[Oh my God, was Tong Zhao this cute when she was little? Or does she still look like this now?]
 

 
[I've never seen this side of Tong Zhao. Whenever she attends public events... she always gives off this strong, independent vibe? I never imagined she had such a baby side!]
 

 
My heart is melting.
 

 
The production team didn’t expect Xiao Zhao's subconscious to love sleeping in so much. They quickly controlled the fake hand to escape Xiao Zhao's grip. The special effects team added a panicked sound effect, and to everyone's surprise, another fake hand appeared in mid-air. The two hands gently rubbed Xiao Zhao's cheeks—
 

 
Just like rubbing a cat, they rubbed Xiao Zhao!
 

 
"Ugh..."
 

 
This time, Xiao Zhao was really poked awake.
 

 
Since this is a variety show, children are unaware of the camera's presence and often can't control their temper. Audiences who are used to this type of show are more understanding of the little guests and won’t engage in vicious online bullying. The edited version of the show will intentionally reduce the audience's dislike for the mischievous kids by using editing techniques.
 

 
This approach received quite a bit of praise.
 

 
The director was very aware that having boundaries is necessary for long-term success.
 

 
The show is meant to be heartwarming, funny, and adorable. While provoking controversy might generate buzz in the short term, over time people won’t want to see kids on the show. The association would also issue warnings.
 

 
So, did Xiao Zhao get mad after being woken up?
 

 
The audience was really curious to see Xiao Zhao get angry.
 

 
She’s usually so perfect, without much to criticize. Her fans admire her from a distance, seeing her as a big star who’s not like someone who’s only been in the industry for a little over a year. Her dazzling achievements and illustrious titles are quite fitting. But the thing is, people’s attitudes toward stars are strange—if she always shows a perfect image, even the rare moments when she’s soft and vulnerable make people want to protect her.
 

 
Don’t ask, just want to ‘rua’ (squeeze/cuddle).
 

 
"I want to sleep..."
 

 
The top-notch recording equipment allowed the audience to hear her sweet, milk-like complaint very clearly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao opened her eyes.
 

 
The fake hand wasn’t very forceful when it rubbed her face earlier, but who would have thought her skin was so delicate? After being rubbed, the corner of her eye faintly turned red, and her bright, moist deer-like eyes angrily stared at the fake hand. The camera was set up behind the fake hand, and the audience was terrified by the intensity of her glare.
 

 
Xiao Zhao pouted and grabbed the culprit, not letting it go: "You bullied me, I’m telling mommy."
 

 
#First to report to mommy#
 

 
[Mom’s here! Mommy loves you! Director, come out and face your death!]
 

 
[Too much sweetness, sob sob sob, Xiao Zhao come to mommy’s arms and cry]
 

 
[Those who say mommy protects you must’ve voted 'yes' earlier.]
 

 
Some viewers thought about Xiao Zhao's father’s character and understood why she only goes to her mother when she's being bullied—what about her mom? Some veteran fans explained that Xiao Zhao only debuted after her mother passed away. However, she usually doesn’t talk about this; when reporters asked, she would downplay it and not give much of a response, as if she was indifferent about family ties.
 

 
But looking at how attached she is to her mom—can her family ties really be indifferent?
 

 
Xiao Zhao's grip was surprisingly strong, and the fake hand couldn't break free right away, eventually disappearing helplessly into thin air.
 

 
"Eh?"
 

 
Xiao Zhao couldn't believe it and reached out again into thin air.
 

 
Naturally, she grabbed nothing. There was nothing there.
 

 
Next, it was time to wake up the other little guests.
 

 
As everyone knows, when entering the holographic shooting, the transition of consciousness doesn't happen instantly. The stronger and broader the brain domain, the faster a person wakes up. That’s why, when filming survival variety shows, Xiao Zhao always woke up earlier than the others.
 

 
And this time was no different.
 

 
The host was about to wake up the other little guests when Xiao Zhao flipped off the pillow mountain and hopped twice to stretch her arms and legs. The other three little guests were scattered in different parts of the room.
 

 
Xiao Zhao raised her head.
 

 
The audience was confused, thinking she was about to do some aerobics. Just then, when the camera cut to wake up another little boy, Xiao Zhao took three steps with a ‘thud’ and skillfully grabbed the fake hand.
 

 
She had been observing, waiting for the hand that kept poking her face to appear!
 

 
"You can’t bully the other kids."
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s serious expression looked just like a kindergarten leader.
 

 
[Our Xiao Zhao has been domineering since she was little!]
 

 
[Give Xiao Zhao a cigarette... no, a lollipop!]
 

 
[Don’t say anything, the bottle is filled with white wine, full to the top. After drinking it, let out a big milk burp.]
 

 
The production team had no choice but to send a nanny from the holographic show into the room. She crouched down and gently explained to Xiao Zhao that it was time for the kids to leave school, and if they didn’t wake up, their parents would be waiting outside for a long time. Unexpectedly, Xiao Zhao accepted the explanation and didn’t stop the nanny from waking up the other little guest, sitting quietly on the side instead.
 

 
Even though she didn’t know the cameras were filming, Xiao Zhao still sat very quietly and well-behaved, without making any extra movements. Her calm little face subtly showed the future star power she would have. Fans suddenly realized that Xiao Zhao had been a well-behaved angel since she was young.
 

 
I really want to take her home and raise her, she looks so easy to handle.
 

 
This time, there were five adults, but only four little guests.
 

 
So, one of the little guests could choose to be taken care of by two adults.
 

 
The variety show had many strange settings. Due to the codes placed at more fundamental positions, the guests accepted these bizarre settings as naturally as they would accept that one plus one equals two. Next came the part where the children and parents chose each other.
 

 
Since it was the first episode, the host interviewed both the adult and child guests about what kind of guardian and child they would like to have.
 

 
When asked, Zhang Shi spoke with slight sorrow:
 

 
"What kind of child? One like mine, someone who looks like they’re my biological child at first glance, that would be great."
 

 
The show was playing to its maximum effect.
 

 
Zhang Shi had played many roles of honest, straightforward people.
 

 
Although playing the same type of character in ‘Instinct Films’ was common, it did bring some psychological issues. For example, Zhang Shi, who had never been betrayed in reality, was subconsciously affected by these thoughts.
 

 
The glamorous Long Fei didn’t seem like she was there to pick up a child, but more like she was there to perform. She explicitly said: "Can I want whatever I like? Then I want a beautiful and talented child, one who can get first place."
 

 
Just as the audience was about to develop a negative impression, the host asked her what if the child was unattractive and not very smart?
 

 
Long Fei answered nonchalantly: "I’ll still raise them. What am I supposed to do, put them back in my stomach and redo them? No? If they’re ugly, I’ll just make more money. If you have money, you won’t be ugly."
 

 
The other female guest, Xie Zihan, couldn’t answer the question.
 

 
She was only twenty years old and hadn’t thought about having children.
 

 
"I’d be a bit scared of not taking care of the child properly."
 

 
"I’d like to team up with the other parents later."
 

 
In contrast to her lively and bright appearance on the talent show, Xie Zihan’s subconscious was a bit reserved and shy. Her manager was visibly restless—on the show, she and Xiao Zhao shared some similarities, but in ‘Instinct Variety’, she was completely different.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao shrugged: "I can take care of myself."
 

 
That answer was pretty unreliable.
 

 
But Ye Fanxiao, at 25, was still in the prime of his career in the entertainment industry. Men in this field typically have a longer golden period, and he still carried the "little fresh meat" label, adopting the cool, charismatic, and rebellious persona. So, this response was expected.
 

 
Moreover, there was still Jiang Dang behind him.
 

 
The audience felt that his answer would be even more unreliable.
 

 
This was also why the host had arranged for him to be last. They felt he had a good sense of humor.
 

 
...
 

 
"Children?"
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the sofa, his long legs casually draped over the armrest.
 

 
When he heard the host’s question, he shifted his gaze and, as he looked at the host, he unknowingly made eye contact with the camera behind him. His eyes held a cool, captivating gleam, and with his voice, which seemed to exude desire to the extreme, he said something that even a dog wouldn’t want to hear:
 

 
“I want someone who can take care of me.”
 

 
A question mark filled the entire live broadcast screen.
 

 
The host, unable to believe it, repeated his words: “Take care of you? Mr. Jiang, this... this doesn’t seem right.”
 

 
You’re a charming and aloof villain, expecting innocent and cute children to take care of you.
 

 
Is this okay? It’s not okay.
 

 
“What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Jiang Dang was genuinely surprised, having never thought that his words might be inappropriate. It seemed as though the host’s implied criticism had struck a nerve, and he slightly lowered his eyelashes, casting a soft shadow over his cold, fair skin: “My agent knows. I’m very obedient and easy to handle.”
 

 
At home, his agent was so furious that they reached for an emergency heart-saving pill.
 

 
They shouldn’t have agreed to let him appear on ‘Instinct Variety’.
 

 
Acting is one thing; you can always use “character settings” to brush it off, but this was clearly a glimpse of his true nature!
 

 
And he’s easy to handle, huh?
 

 
His agent was anxious, but it didn’t cause much of a stir among Jiang Dang’s fans.
 

 
After all, it wasn’t the first time he’d been unreliable. He wasn’t even married in real life, so it’s not like he was being irresponsible toward actual children. He doesn’t care about creating a persona and focuses on making hit love songs, occasionally showing his face. That’s enough for him.
 

 
This answer strangely stirred up some maternal instincts in certain female fans, who suddenly wanted to take care of him.
 

 
It can only be said that as long as you have good looks, you can always spark affection in unexpected ways.
 

 
The host was struggling: “So, Mr. Jiang, you want to find someone who can take care of you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head: “I’d like to think that, but that kind of thing doesn’t happen.” The handsome guy looked even more troubled, and the audience laughed so hard they almost fell over. So, it turns out he has some common sense after all. They had thought he really wanted to find a little baby to take care of a silly dad.
 

 
“As long as they can look at me,”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled slightly: “They’re my child.”
 

 
— My, child.
 

 
The last two words, “child,” were pronounced with emphasis. What should have been a completely serious statement was instead delivered like a tender love confession.
 

 
The female audience couldn’t laugh anymore.
 

 
Originally, the audience watched him like they would watch a silly kid, but now they couldn’t handle it anymore. Their preferences were under attack, and their ears were ringing!
 

 
[Ahhh, I want to be Brother Dang’s child, Dang, come to me head-on!]
 

 
[Looks aren’t important, it’s his voice, ah, I really want to do ‘kkp’ with him.]
 

 
[‘kkp’? What does that mean?]
 

 
[Stop posting such comments on a variety show that kids are watching!!]
 

 
The topic of ‘kkp’ was dropped there.
 

 
The agent’s worries about cleaning up his fan base were unnecessary. Jiang Dang didn’t think appearing on this show would cause him any problems. He was clearly a sensible and mature adult. After the interview, the caregiver led the four kids out of the game room...
 

 
A string of kids.
 

 
Zhao Zai was walking in the front, holding hands with a boy and a girl on either side.
 

 
The little girl had a flower bud hairstyle, and her round face was framed by a pair of bright, lively eyes. She was a bit shy, tightly holding onto Zhao Zai’s hand. The other boy was also about six years old, and seemed a bit nervous.
 

 
There was only one young boy with brown hair, walking with his hands behind his back, lingering at the back.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t want to interact with anyone.
 

 
Black hair and black eyes are dominant genes, so having blonde hair and blue eyes was unlikely. But the mixed-race little Noah took after his father. His hair was lighter in color, with large eyes, long lashes, and a high nose. He looked like a second-generation star with the right genes, combining the softness of an Easterner with the deep contours of a Germanic person. If you looked closely, his eyes even had a gentle blue hue, and he looked like a child from an oil painting.
 

 
Good-looking people have privileges.
 

 
Even though he acted aloof, as soon as he appeared, he immediately captured the hearts of many fans who loved good looks, with people calling him the perfect little boy of their dreams.
 

 
However, what more people were curious about was what happened in the room earlier. Why were the two little kids sticking to their "big mother hen" Zhao Zai like chicks sticking to their mother hen?
 

 
Those who were watching the live broadcast from the kids’ side explained in the comments—
 

 
[In short, it’s the scene of picking up little brothers.]
 

 
＊
 

 
Let’s rewind to ten minutes ago.
 

 
The caregiver was interviewing the kids about what kind of parents they wanted.
 

 
In the kids' subconscious, their memories of their mom and dad were temporarily blocked, making them feel like they were being born again, choosing their own parents to spend seven days with. However, after Jia Jia and Xiao Quan woke up, they were still in a panic, pouting and wanting to cry, and even the caregiver’s comforting hugs didn’t help.
 

 
When Zhao Zai walked over, held their hands, and softly coaxed them, it worked.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Viewers analyzed that, for young children, adults are like beings from another level, and the caregiver’s comfort only scratched the surface. When Jia Jia saw another little boy on the verge of tears, she wanted to cry too. But when she saw Zhao Zai...
 

 
“There are so many pillows here,” Zhao Zai naturally took her hand and spoke, “It feels a little smaller than the kindergarten I used to go to. Did you sleep enough just now?”
 

 
The little girl had tears in her eyes and nodded dumbly.
 

 
The little boy who had been on the verge of crying earlier watched her calmly, as if he had found a pillar of support. He also came over and wanted to hold her hand: “I... I didn’t sleep enough!”
 

 
“Well, we can find another chance to nap later,”
 

 
Life isn’t easy, Zhao Zai sighed: “I didn’t sleep enough either.”
 

 
[Look at what you two have done!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao must be really busy with work. She always appears so energetic in public, but it turns out she has such a sleepy side behind the scenes. Adorable beauty.]
 

 
[What’s the deal with this little boy holding my girl’s hand? Zhao Zai can’t have an early crush, I won’t let this little brat take advantage, her dad won’t allow it!]
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand much about how to speak to others.
 

 
Consort Chen knows how to flirt, Duan Ge can mix both kindness and authority, and Shuyi knows how to coax people...
 

 
Adults have many tricks and techniques.
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t know any of that, but she was simply the most dazzling kid in kindergarten.
 

 
Some people are just born to be big shots.
 

 
The two little kids clung to Zhao Zai like accessories, while Noah, who had just woken up, stared at her with a displeased expression. His handsome face fell.
 

 
Two tigers can’t coexist on the same mountain!
# Chapter120
The two little children tightly held onto Zhao Zai's hand.
 

 
Perhaps because they now had a reliable support, they were not particularly interested in the other adults. When asked if they wanted to play games with any of the older brothers or sisters, they shook their heads vigorously.
 

 
The host had already anticipated this, so the living room was prepared with a lot of toys.
 

 
Children who appear on this kind of show don’t usually lack toys in real life, but no child would ever complain about having too many toys. It’s in their DNA to prefer new and exciting things. When the two of them saw three large boxes filled with various brightly colored toys, all new and shiny, their eyes immediately stuck to them.
 

 
Only Noah crossed his arms, looking disdainfully at the toys.
 

 
What’s so fun about these toy planes and boats?
 

 
The host, seeing this, immediately squatted down with a smile and asked, "If you don’t want to play games, would you like to play with the toys together with the older brothers and sisters?"
 

 
“Well… a little,” Jia Jia hesitated as she shook Zhao Zai’s hand.
 

 
The other boy whispered, "I want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jia Jia blinked her watery eyes once, worried about falling behind, and quickly agreed, "I also want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
So, who will Tong Zhao play with?
 

 
The audience was a little curious.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao debuted, there had been a few rumors about her, with some even calling her a "sea king." However, these were just rumors. Aside from Wei Zekai showing anxiety about possibly having dinner with Tong Zhao in her live stream, there had been no such rumors involving the other men.
 

 
If there was anything going on, would it be this peaceful?
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head to the left and bumped her head against Jia Jia’s. "I’ll play with you."
 

 
Then she tilted her head to the right, "You play too."
 

 
---
 

 
[True Master of Balancing Water]
 

 
[The Kindergarten "Sea King" Is Actually Right Next to Me]
 

 
[I Want to Stick with Zhao Zai, I Want to Play with Toys Too!]
 

 
At this moment, Noah loudly said, "What’s so fun about these toys for kids?"
 

 
As he spoke, he disdainfully turned up his nose at the toy box.
 

 
This time, the two little kids, who had been absorbed by the toys, were no longer happy.
 

 
Children’s unhappiness is written all over their faces. Although they didn’t start crying immediately, Noah’s words had already put him in the “we don’t want to play with him” category in their minds.
 

 
The host was about to console them when Zhao Zai turned her head to look at him.
 

 
Her eyes were a light shade, clear and bright, and even though she was so small, it was obvious she had a beautiful face. Noah, under her steady gaze, suddenly felt a bit anxious and short of breath…
 

 
This wasn’t the first time.
 

 
When he had woken up earlier in the game room and saw this child for the first time, his heart had skipped a beat in an uncomfortable way.
 

 
What does this mean?
 

 
It means they were natural enemies!
 

 
It’s like Ultraman seeing a monster.
 

 
It’s like the Black Cat Sheriff seeing a cat-eating rat.
 

 
It’s like the Calabash Brothers seeing the Snake Spirit!
 

 
Noah, feeling a sense of impending danger, said, "Why are you looking at me?"
 

 
"I was thinking…"
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her little head. "These are toys for kids, so we must be kids then."
 

 
This child doesn’t seem very bright.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Noah was momentarily speechless.
 

 
"What’s fun about these toy boats and planes? I don’t like them. If we’re going to play, let’s play with real planes and big ships." At this point, Noah’s expression turned smug. "Do you know what those are? They can carry a lot of people and fly in the sky or float on the water."
 

 
In the world of children, knowing more than your classmates is a big deal.
 

 
Of course, this logic tends to carry over to school and the workplace as well.
 

 
The audience in the live stream couldn’t help but marvel at the world of the rich.
 

 
Noah’s parents were wealthy, and in reality, they often traveled by private plane.
 

 
Although he had forgotten about this fact while participating in the variety show, his subconscious made it clear that they weren’t starting from the same place.
 

 
"Oh~"
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded seriously.
 

 
"Don’t mind him."
 

 
Jia Jia lightly tugged at Zhao Zai’s sleeve. Noah’s attitude made her feel uncomfortable.
 

 
After thinking it over, Zhao Zai really wanted to "borrow" Noah’s big plane and big ship:
 

 
"Can you bring them out and play with us?"
 

 
"How could I bring them out? I-I don’t have any… I was just saying, real planes and ships are much more fun. These toys for little kids aren’t interesting at all."
 

 
Noah thought what he said made a lot of sense.
 

 
But, loud as he was, his confidence started to waver.
 

 
"So you don’t have big planes and big ships, huh?" Zhao Zai sighed, her disappointment evident. "I thought you were really impressive."
 

 
...
 

 
"…Well, I’m still way better than you playing with these toys!"
 

 
If broken hearts could make a sound, it would be the frustrated voice of young Master Noah now. His pride shattered into pieces, and there was a slight hint of a sob in his voice.
 

 
Realizing his mental state was breaking down, Noah, to avoid crying in front of everyone, tightly pressed his lips together and sniffed. When he noticed Zhao Zai looked like she was about to say something else, he quickly braced himself and gave her a fierce glare—
 

 
What else was this annoying woman going to say to hurt him?
 

 
He had mentally prepared himself.
 

 
Zhao Zai, with a face full of hope, said, "Then you have to work hard to get a big ship and a big plane. If you get one, remember to take me to play!"
 

 
After saying that, she acted like the topic was over, pulling her two little followers to the seats arranged by the host. She sat gracefully and quietly, like a well-behaved little princess. Noah was caught off guard, stunned in place, before the nanny coaxed him into sitting down.
 

 
[Ah, this…]
 

 
[Look at the reaction of this little rich boy. Is he liking Zhao Zai?]
 

 
[Does a six-year-old even know what "liking" means?]
 

 
[Sigh, whether or not they understand "liking," it's definitely true that they are all about looks. My son only wants to lend his toys to classmates who look good, and he likes uncles and aunts who are good-looking. He’s always drawn to familiar faces.]
 

 
The audience couldn’t help but sigh that appreciating beauty is human nature.
 

 
The audience’s guess was pretty close, and Noah’s face didn’t hide anything.
 

 
But it wasn’t as pink and bubbly as the audience thought.
 

 
Noah wanted to be the center of attention, to have Zhao Zai admire him, and to express his superiority by belittling the toys they were playing with. When things didn’t go the way he expected, he became anxious and embarrassed. Because he was good-looking, Noah was somewhat of a child star. He was often flown around by his mother to attend events as part of her way of gaining publicity, which meant he had no fixed school to attend.
 

 
His father was wealthy and hired excellent tutors, so not only did Noah never fall behind in his studies, he even learned better than his peers.
 

 
However, this also meant he didn’t have much experience interacting with children his own age.
 

 
＊
 

 
With Zhao Zai’s active mediation, the two little followers who had been playing for a while finally weren’t so shy anymore. They understood that, although Tong Zhao was great, she was still just a child like them. She couldn’t be their guardian, and they still needed to choose a parent.
 

 
However, when it came to choosing a guardian, the two children still felt a bit reluctant.
 

 
Noah noticed how hesitant they were and felt a bit disgusted. He was thinking to himself, what could he do now to stand out? Why hadn’t anyone begged him to be their child yet?
 

 
At this moment, Zhao Zai’s sense of responsibility once again drove her to step forward.
 

 
“It’s actually not scary,”
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped off the sofa and confidently presented herself to everyone, her expression serious. She had a pair of beautiful eyes, her light-colored pupils misty and round, looking as innocent as a fawn’s eyes. But her high, elegant brow and nose gave her face a full, graceful look, the perfect prototype of a little beauty growing into a stunning one.
 

 
She lifted a bright smile:
 

 
“Is there anyone willing to be my guardian for a while?”
 

 
...
 

 
[I'll do it! I'll do it!]
 

 
[Be my baby forever, Zhao Zai is so well-behaved.]
 

 
[Seriously wondering why that lousy father would choose that little sister.]
 

 
Whether it was during the game earlier or in her current speech, Zhao Zai always gave off the impression that she was easy to take care of, which made the guests very drawn to her. Both Ye Xiaofan and Long Fei thought she was very suitable for them and started competing for her.
 

 
It was just a reality variety show.
 

 
Just like the "China’s Good Voice" segment where the guests compete for contestants, they always do so with genuine emotions. It’s the most authentic side of the guests' subconscious, and it’s exactly what the audience loves to see.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, true to form, made a disdainful face: “You wear such heavy makeup, can you really take care of a child?”
 

 
“You wear makeup too, so why criticize me?” Long Fei smirked. “Tong Zhao is a girl. It’s more appropriate for a female guardian to take care of her than a male one.”
 

 
...
 

 
This was something Ye Xiaofan hadn’t expected.
 

 
"Baby Chaos" didn’t actually have a rule that the gender of the guests had to match that of the child.
 

 
In real life, it’s hard to guarantee the boundaries of interactions between the opposite sex, but in the holographic world, it’s much easier to control. When guests participate in children’s shows, they sign contracts waiving certain privacy rights, allowing instruments to scan them and ensuring they have no tendencies toward pedophilia. This was taken to the utmost level in protecting children.
 

 
However, if the same guests were competing, there was an advantage to being the same gender.
 

 
For example, for younger children, or those who don’t have the habit of bathing alone, it’s necessary for a same-gender guest to take care of them.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, having been outmaneuvered, clicked his tongue in frustration.
 

 
The nice guy Zhang Shi and Xie Zihan saw that the two were getting into a competition and didn’t want to argue with them. Instead, they quietly started talking to the other two children.
 

 
Only Noah, who had been expected to be one of the highlights of the show, was ignored.
 

 
And what about Jiang Dang?
 

 
He seemed to have been offline for quite a while.
 

 
Fans were anxiously hoping that the older brother would grab more screen time, but upon reflection, they realized he didn’t really need this exposure. They sighed, thinking that wherever he ended up, it didn’t really matter. He probably didn’t care much about being stuck with the prickly Noah.
 

 
Just as Ye Xiaofan was in the middle of arguing with Long Fei, Jiang Dang unexpectedly sneakily made his way over to Zhao Zai’s side:
 

 
"Do you like listening to music?"
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively raised her hand and scratched her ear.
 

 
For some reason, whenever this man spoke, her ears felt itchy.
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
Jiang Dang lowered his head and gently hummed a few verses of a popular children's song, singing whatever was trending.
 

 
His voice was so catchy that even the two children who had been talking to Zhang Shi leaned in: “Brother, can you sing something else?”
 

 
“I can sing anything. What do you want to hear?”
 

 
“‘Blue Bird’! The theme song of ‘Naruto Shippuden’—do you know ‘Naruto’?”
 

 
Jiang Dang hummed a part of the Chinese version of the theme song, which totally mesmerized the kids.
 

 
After arguing with Long Fei for seven rounds, Ye Xiaofan finally sensed something was wrong.
 

 
He turned around to look.
 

 
Well, well, the bad guy wasn’t being honest, was he? Instead of talking, he was over there singing songs to amuse the children?
 

 
“Don’t listen to him, let me show you some dance moves.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had stood out in the competition because of his excellent street dance skills.
 

 
Saying that, he did a one-handed windmill spin right there on the spot.
 

 
This wasn’t something that had happened before. The segment, originally filled with warmth, had turned into a talent show, and the audience felt like they had somehow tuned into the neighboring show, ‘China’s New Dance King’.
 

 
The two kids were impressed by the cool move, and Zhao Zai looked up at Jiang Dang and asked, “Can you do that too?”
 

 
“…I can’t! Can you dance?”
 

 
“I can do ballet.”
 

 
Zhao Zai answered seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Then can you choose me to be your guardian, and teach me ballet?”
# Chapter121
What is going on here?
 

 
It’s like everyone else is pulling money out of their pockets, showing it to the little girl and saying, “If you follow me, I can give you a lot of money,” and then this guy jumps out and says, “Sister, give me some.”
 

 
[Hahahahahaha]
 

 
[You really can't predict what kind of crazy move he’ll pull next.]
 

 
[Can't do anything right, but top the list in talking. Looks like singing kids' songs to entertain children is his emotional intelligence highlight, thank goodness for that.]
 

 
The audience was laughing happily.
 

 
However, the next second, after thinking seriously, Zhao Zai asked, “Do you really want to learn? There are almost no boys in my class.”
 

 
Ballet, because of its tight-fitting costumes and graceful, feminine movements, is often regarded as a dance exclusively for girls. Not only in China, but even abroad, there have been cases of young boys who were bullied for learning ballet and even committed suicide because of it.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked in return: “Boys can’t learn ballet? Do you think it’s inappropriate?”
 

 
His tone didn’t sound like he was talking to a child, but more like discussing a phenomenon with a peer.
 

 
Zhao Zai thought for a moment, then seriously said in her sweet little voice: “You can, I don’t think it’s inappropriate. If you want to learn, I can teach you, but learning ballet is hard. I’m not a teacher, I can only tell you what the teacher taught me and repeat it to you~”
 

 
“Pinky promise?”
 

 
Jiang Dang reached out his hand, and Zhao Zai didn’t hesitate to place her much smaller hand in his, linking their fingers and giving a gentle shake.
 

 
This warm and friendly scene, however, was met with nothing but question marks in the comments section.
 

 
It can be called a large-scale online confusion scene.
 

 
[Zhao Zai——]
 

 
[LOL, I’m already feeling what it’s like for a girl to run off with an unreliable guy.]
 

 
[I’m all for the Dang-Zhao CP... but I bought the viewing rights expecting to see them together raising a cute kid, not Zhao Zai turning into the cute kid! The affection has warped! This is fatherly love!]
 

 
Some more rational viewers analyzed that this development actually made sense.
 

 
Others were performing talents, which were nice to watch, just for the fun of it.
 

 
It might attract ordinary kids who, because they admired Ye Xiaofan, want to live with him and see the big windmill every day. However, for Zhao Zai, there was no need for that. From the moment she woke up in the show, she instinctively went to take care of the weaker ones. Whenever others asked for her help or relied on her, as long as it was reasonable, she was willing to lend them a hand.
 

 
Meanwhile, Ye Xiaofan, who was dancing very energetically, was already sweating.
 

 
The fans and kids were enjoying it, and the fans thought he had seized the opportunity to appear on the show and proved that he was truly talented at dancing, not just someone who knew a little and used his love for street dance as a gimmick.
 

 
The two little kids, who were mesmerized, clapped for him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan turned around to look at Zhao Zai: "How was it, big brother... [sound muted]!"
 

 
Zhao Zai was wearing a pink little genius phone watch on her left wrist.
 

 
This was a symbol that the little guest had already found their parent.
 

 
Throughout the whole show, this phone watch could only connect to her parents and the host.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan shifted his gaze and indeed saw Jiang Dang, who was fiddling with a matching pink phone. The phone only had the most basic functions. Jiang Dang could certainly use it, but as he absentmindedly played with the phone, it seemed like he didn’t even know how to use it. Zhao Zai immediately leaned over to teach the big brother how to use the phone.
 

 
Special effects text displayed: "The smart AI has captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts..."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"The smart AI captured nothing!"
 

 
He was just zoning out while looking cool with his charming and aloof face.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to teach him, but Jiang Dang didn’t tell her that he actually knew how to use it, so he listened to her.
 

 
The audience knew he was listening.
 

 
Because when Zhao Zai spoke to him, the smart AI finally managed to capture his thoughts. He was silently repeating Zhao Zai’s words in his head, carefully taking in all the small phone tips that no adult would understand: [Press here to call her, the camera is over there, you can also set an alarm…]
 

 
[So many functions!]
 

 
The handsome guy had an epiphany.
 

 
[... What are you suddenly realizing?!]
 

 
The comments on the live stream were uncontrollable at this point.
 

 
The audience's mood resonated with Ye Xiaofan's incredulous expression.
 

 
After understanding the whole situation, Ye Xiaofan’s mentality collapsed even more: “Jiang Dang, I danced, okay? What about you? What did you do?”
 

 
“Hmm.”
 

 
Jiang Dang, who was directly called out, raised his eyes and looked at him sincerely.
 

 
That gaze was really quite sincere.
 

 
If his manager, who was watching the live stream, saw that look, they would’ve had a PTSD flashback right on the spot.
 

 
When Ye Xiaofan questioned him, Jiang Dang slowly clapped his hands and sincerely praised him: “You danced really well.”
 

 
?
 

 
Little friend, do you have many questions?
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought he was being mocked and was about to blow up right there. But Jiang Dang flipped over his phone and showed him the album: “I just took a really handsome one.”
 

 
In the album, there was Ye Xiaofan mid-Crazy Freeze.
 

 
The photo caught him with a cold expression doing a high-difficulty move, exuding a cool and charismatic aura—he really did look pretty handsome.
 

 
“Ah...”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan scratched his nose, looking like a big lion whose fur was stroked the right way: “Not bad, I guess. It’s pretty average, normal level.”
 

 
He completely forgot that he had come to question Jiang Dang because his turf was invaded, and that he had used his own phone to ask for this candid shot. Ye Xiaofan’s fans were torn between being heartbroken that their brother was so easy to fool and honestly following along to screenshot the perfect shot.
 

 
Jiang Dang taking a candid shot of Ye Xiaofan turned out to be another marketing talking point.
 

 
Moreover, the shot was flawless!
 

 
The audience looked at Jiang Dang with different eyes now.
 

 
Was he a white-cut-black type, or was this just a lucky mistake?
 

 
In any case, Ye Xiaofan, who had been shown up by his own handsomeness, felt embarrassed and didn’t press the matter further. Meanwhile, Long Fei, who saw Zhao Zai leaving with Jiang Dang, was a little troubled. But after thinking about it, she realized that she neither knew how to sing nor dance, and then she glanced at the face that had cooled her anger... She silently decided to let it go with a simple “forget it.”
 

 
Others were going their separate ways. Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai went to cultivate their relationship.
 

 
Long Fei and the ever-patient Xie Zihan took away Jia Jia.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had conquered Xiao Quan with his street dance, but unfortunately, the little boy wasn’t assertive enough. Ye Xiaofan, however, was more interested in the handsome Noah. Noah had been observing quietly, feeling quite ignored since the beginning. This time, being actively chosen, he didn’t put on airs and happily put on the gold-colored little genius watch.
 

 
In the end, Zhang Shi took over Xiao Quan.
 

 
The two of them standing together surprisingly gave off a somewhat cute father-son vibe.
 

 
Each “temporary family” is assigned a separate detached house, with each family living next to each other for seven days. During this period, there will be occasional activities and competitions. Before they separated, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia pulled Zhao Zai aside and whispered to her.
 

 
“I heard from Brother Fan that your parent isn’t reliable,”
 

 
Xiao Quan said in a low voice, “Why don’t you come live with me instead? My uncle is very reliable.”
 

 
Zhang Shi had a certain big brother aura about him.
 

 
Even though he hadn’t done anything, just looking at him gave people a sense of safety.
 

 
Jia Jia, in a hurry, interrupted: “Zhao Zai should live with me. I have two beautiful sisters at home!”
 

 
The instinctive variety show doesn’t mean that everyone just speaks their mind without restraint. It’s just a little more relaxed compared to reality. Ye Xiaofan, in most real-life situations, is someone who speaks his mind, so he was the one to openly express what the other guests thought of Jiang Dang— a genius songwriter with a mind that worked differently from others. Could he really take care of a child? Ye Xiaofan was skeptical.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans were quite nervous, worried that Jiang Dang's fans might get angry.
 

 
But then the fans wearing Jiang Dang’s fan badges were all agreeing:
 

 
[“You think my Brother Dang isn’t reliable? I’m fine with being called crazy.”]
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans: [……]
 

 
You could only say, fans follow their idol.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head, her voice soft but firm:
 

 
“I just met Brother Dang, and I don’t know what kind of adult he is, so…”
 

 
Jia Jia quickly interrupted her: “What if he doesn’t know how to bathe himself?”
 

 
Jiang Dang's fans: [……]
 

 
That was a bit too much.
 

 
In a child’s world, they’re willing to believe many strange guesses and don’t preemptively limit answers. Zhao Zai was a bit startled by this assumption—oh right, what if an adult who doesn’t even know how to use a phone (but he does) doesn’t know how to bathe himself? She didn’t learn to bathe on her own until after her fifth birthday. Her mother had installed a handrail in the bathroom at her height to prevent her from falling.
 

 
At first, her mother would sit next to her and watch her bathe. Later, when Zhao Zai got used to it, her mother would wait outside the bathroom door.
 

 
Zhao Zai firmly believed that, whether adults or children, there are tasks that must be solved on one’s own.
 

 
And she would never be defeated by difficulty.
 

 
No matter how tall the mountain standing in front of her, it would only ignite Zhao Zai’s fighting spirit!
 

 
Zhao Zai quietly clenched her fist and, with the resolve of Zheng Chenggong restoring the Ming Dynasty and Liu Bei reviving the Han Empire, said resolutely: “If he doesn’t know how to bathe, I’ll teach him. I’ll teach him until he knows how. Since he’s an adult, he should learn faster than me. I took three days to learn how to bathe myself. I’ll teach Brother Dang to bathe on his own within two days!”
 

 
What a heroic spirit.
 

 
The two little children and the audience in the live stream were deeply shocked.
 

 
“Alright then,” Jia Jia said, reluctantly tugging at her hand. “If you really can’t teach him, you have to tell us, so that Sister Fei and Sister Zi Han can teach him together.”
 

 
“And me, and me!”
 

 
The children got a bit distracted as they chatted.
 

 
Even someone as clever as Zhao Zai forgot that “Jiang Dang can’t bathe by himself” was just an extreme scenario suggested by another child, with no real evidence to back it up.
 

 
...
 

 
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Zhao Zai had somehow taken on the invisible task of “teaching Jiang Dang to bathe alone.”
 

 
And Jiang Dang didn’t know that, in the minds of the three little ones, he now bore the responsibility of “learning to bathe.”
 

 
For a moment, the audience couldn’t even tell who was worse off.
 

 
To put the younger ones at ease, Zhao Zai was the last to leave.
 

 
She sent them off one by one. Although each child looked back three times as they walked, their steps were light, bouncing and full of energy.
 

 
After sending them off, Zhao Zai visibly relaxed, and gracefully walked over to where Jiang Dang was sitting in the corner, playing on his phone. He had been waiting for her, not rushing or asking when she was going to leave. When she walked over, he immediately put his phone back in his pocket, curling his lips into a smile. “Ready to go home?”
 

 
“Mhm, let’s go.”
 

 
Zhao Zai naturally extended her hand, letting Jiang Dang hold it.
 

 
It didn’t feel like a guardian taking care of a child; it felt more like adopting a lazy big cat.
 

 
“Do you want me to hold your hand?” Jiang Dang asked.
 

 
“Mhm, otherwise I might get lost. I asked the host for a map earlier. It’ll take about three minutes to walk home from here.”
 

 
Look at this child, so sensible.
 

 
Some audience members who couldn’t read maps were already wondering how a child like this would even come into being, so practical!
 

 
At this moment, the program team pulled up the content Jiang Dang had been looking at on his phone earlier—
 

 
He had been checking the map of the park.
 

 
He knew exactly how to get there.
 

 
But Jiang Dang didn’t say anything. When he heard Zhao Zai was going to guide him, he smiled again. “You just need to show me the way.”
 

 
He bent down and gently picked her up, holding her in his arms.
 

 
He was very careful, making sure her delicate little dress wouldn’t show anything.
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively hugged his neck.
 

 
“I can walk by myself,” she said.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “You just focus on showing me the way.”
 

 
Soon, Zhao Zai experienced the joy of being carried. She swung her little legs gently, focusing all her attention on guiding Brother Dang, afraid he might get lost. Jiang Dang knew exactly which way to take at every fork, but still chose to listen to her.
 

 
During this time, Zhao Zai had forgotten part of the way, but Jiang Dang didn’t point it out. Instead, he followed the parts she could remember, and together they slowly found the villa arranged by the host. By then, they were a little later than the other temporary families.
 

 
“Sorry, I remembered the way wrong earlier,” Zhao Zai whispered.
 

 
“You’re tired. It’s normal to make mistakes when you’re tired,” Jiang Dang said, reaching out to gently pat the back of her head. His fingers, usually used for playing guitar and piano, threaded through her soft hair and pressed lightly on her little head. The sensation was soothing and comforting, almost tickling. “Even when I’m not tired, I still make mistakes often.”
 

 
“Is that so…”
 

 
Zhao Zai blinked her eyes.
 

 
After he said that and patted her, her eyelids suddenly grew heavy. Her limbs felt like they were filled with lead. She changed to a more comfortable position, resting her head on his neck. She hadn’t slept well in the afternoon due to the disturbances, and when she saw the other children looking scared and unsettled, she forced herself to stay alert, putting on a bright and strong face in front of others.
 

 
She asked them if they were scared.
 

 
No one asked her if she was tired or wanted to sleep.
 

 
So what if she was tired?
 

 
Zhao Zai still felt she shouldn’t make mistakes. Her stubbornness kicked in, and she mumbled in Jiang Dang’s ear, “I won’t make mistakes again next time, I’m sorry…”
 

 
“If you live with me, I’ll make mistakes often. We’ll balance each other out, and you can consider this as prepaying for one chance to forgive me.”
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand those eight words.
 

 
Her small head grew even heavier, and Jiang Dang patted her back, making her lie more comfortably on the bed.
 

 
Jiang Dang held the little girl with one arm and used the other to open the villa’s door by inputting the code. He hesitated for a moment at the light switch, but then chose to stand still in the entrance for a while, letting their eyes adjust to the darkness before walking further in. Once he found the children’s room, he placed Zhao Zai on the bed, helping her sit up, even though she was already half-asleep.
 

 
Zhao Zai could hardly keep her eyes open. Without thinking, she reached out for the pillow she had been resting on earlier, which led to her grabbing Jiang Dang’s head instead.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head, about to lie down, but Jiang Dang quickly caught her. “At least take off your shoes before sleeping.”
 

 
He kept the position with her holding his head and awkwardly took off her glossy little leather shoes and white socks. Afterward, he thought for a moment, stuffed the socks into the shoes, and placed them by the bed. Then, he managed to free his head from her grasp and laid her flat in the bed, covering her with the blanket tightly.
 

 
He placed a cup of warm water on the bedside table.
 

 
This time, no one would wake her up while she was sleeping.
 

 
It had been a long time since the broadcast started. Some audience members who were just watching for the novelty had already left, waiting for the edited version. Only those who treated this variety show as a form of companionship remained, and when they saw this scene, they were amazed by Jiang Dang’s thoughtfulness.
 

 
Oh, and his manager was watching, too.
 

 
The manager was once again wondering if this guy was intentionally performing for him.
 

 
…
 

 
Zhao Zai woke up in the middle of the night, having fallen asleep too early. The cup of fruit-flavored water she had brought earlier came in handy. She opened the lid and drank slowly, soothing her throat and clearing her mind. Her memories from before bed began to return. In a panic, she jumped out of bed, found her slippers, and made her way to the master bedroom in the dark.
 

 
Jiang Dang had light sleep, and he noticed as soon as a little creature crawled into the bed.
 

 
He opened his eyes.
 

 
What met his gaze was a pair of bright, sparkling eyes.
 

 
“You’re awake?” Jiang Dang asked, showing no intention of getting up.
 

 
His voice was groggy from just waking up, with a hoarse edge to it. His eyes were half-closed, and he reached out to pat her head. His hand felt soft, like a plush toy cat, but his hair was a bit messy from sleep. Without realizing it, he started using his fingers to gently comb through the little girl’s hair.
 

 
“Yeah, I’m awake,”
 

 
Zhao Zai said, lying at the edge of the bed. “Brother Dong, did you take a shower before you went to bed? Do you want me to teach you how to take a shower?”
 

 
…
 

 
It could be called the "Confusing Children’s Statement Award" live.
 

 
“No need, I took a shower before bed.”
 

 
“Can you shower by yourself?”
 

 
Zhao Zai was cautious.
 

 
Adults can lie.
 

 
And they’re often better at it than kids, something she had plenty of experience with.
 

 
“I can,” Jiang Dang said, thinking for a moment. “Can’t you?”
 

 
Even if she couldn’t, he couldn’t shower her, it wouldn’t be appropriate.
 

 
He then looked at a doll in the corner, about the same height as Zhao Zai, and said softly, “If you can’t, I can use that teddy bear to show you how to shower.”
 

 
The teddy bear doll, which wasn’t waterproof, had a large question mark on its head.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head. “I can shower, I’m just worried about you~”
 

 
“Worried about me…”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled. “I’m fine. If you can sleep again, go ahead and sleep. If you’re hungry, I’ll get up and make you something to eat.”
 

 
Zhao Zai said she wasn’t hungry.
 

 
Just as she finished speaking, her stomach let out a loud growl.
 

 
Physiological hunger doesn’t listen to one’s will. Even though Zhao Zai felt it wasn’t quite right to wake up an adult in the middle of the night to make food for her, as it didn’t seem like something a good child would do… her stomach still growled. Zhao Zai quickly covered her stomach, trying to act casual, and was about to turn around and sneak away, pretending nothing happened, when Jiang Dang, who had turned over and sat up, caught her by the back of her neck.
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head up.
 

 
"Go brush your teeth and wash your face, dinner is ready."
 

 
Jiang Dang's voice, still carrying the grogginess of just waking up, was firm and left no room for argument. His slightly grumpy, just-woke-up demeanor only added to the intimidating aura of his villainous face. Zhao Zai weighed the pros and cons and decided it was better to listen to the adult. She obediently went to the bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face. Remembering she hadn’t showered before bed, she called out to Jiang Dang, saying she was going to take a shower. After receiving a simple "Okay," she quickly completed the entire routine.
 

 
After drying her body and wet hair with a large white towel, Zhao Zai put on a brand new set of pajamas and grabbed the railing to look downstairs.
 

 
The kitchen downstairs was lit, with wisps of white steam drifting out.
 

 
The glass door was fogged up, only faintly outlining the figure of a man.
 

 
As if sensing her gaze, Jiang Dang took two steps back and looked up at her.
 

 
"Come downstairs and have some noodles."
# Chapter122
Zhao Zai originally intended to help.
 

 
Although there were servants to handle chores at home, with only her and Brother Dang here, she believed that everyone who ate should contribute. However, when her short legs carried her over to the stove, Jiang Dang gently pressed down on her head.
 

 
"Go sit down."
 

 
"I can help bring the bowls and chopsticks out," Zhao Zai replied seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, "Are you going to walk over, or should I carry you?"
 

 
Zhao Zai stubbornly locked eyes with him for a moment.
 

 
In the end, Jiang Dang handed her a pair of chopsticks and let her take them out.
 

 
The noodles in the small pot were soon cooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked if there was anything she didn’t eat. Zhao Zai shook her head. "I’m not picky~"
 

 
That made things easier.
 

 
After Zhao Zai sat down, she turned her head toward the kitchen.
 

 
The rhythmic sound of chopping filled the air as Jiang Dang sliced scallions into segments and sprinkled them into a bowl. Boiling soup poured over the scallions, cooking them instantly. Their fresh green and white hues glistened, giving the dish an appetizing appearance.
 

 
He placed the bowl in front of Zhao Zai.
 

 
There was only one bowl.
 

 
"Aren’t you eating, Brother Dang?" Zhao Zai asked, holding her chopsticks hesitantly.
 

 
The aroma of the broth wafted up with the steam, whetting her appetite. Although she had only been slightly hungry before, the smell pushed her hunger to a new level. After Jiang Dang reassured her that he wasn’t eating, she couldn't resist breaking the half-cooked egg on top of the soup. The golden yolk oozed out like molten lava, coating the noodles. She picked up a large bite of noodles drenched in yolk and slurped them up, savoring the rich, delicious flavor.
 

 
It was hard to eat noodles without making noise.
 

 
Even though Zhao Zai was extremely hungry, she still managed to restrain herself from devouring the food, not opening up her stomach to eat greedily. She ate quietly in the long night, feeling a warmth spread through her hands and feet as she was satisfied. Just as she was immersed in the delicious food, her little head was gently pressed from behind.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused.
 

 
"Keep eating, I'll do my thing."
 

 
She heard Brother Dang’s voice from behind her.
 

 
Jiang Dang was holding a hairdryer. Zhao Zai’s hair, soft and thick like cat fur, couldn’t handle the full force of the blow, so he set the dryer on a low setting to avoid blowing her head off. The warm, yellow light in the dining room bathed his hands—hands that were elegant and graceful, capable of creating many heartfelt songs, and now, they were simply brushing her hair.
 

 
The scene was warm and heartwarming.
 

 
The intelligent AI tried to read Jiang Dang's subconscious, attempting to capture some human-like thoughts to elevate the moment.
 

 
"AI captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts…"
 

 
"Captured!"
 

 
Finally, the guy was actually thinking about something.
 

 
The assistant director on night shift was moved to tears.
 

 
Jiang Dang:
 

 
"Which came first, the egg or the chicken?"
 

 
"When is the best time to break the egg yolk in a fried egg?"
 

 
…
 

 
Night shift staff: "..."
 

 
When Jiang Dang thinks, even God is speechless.
 

 
By the time Zhao Zai finished her bowl of noodles, her hair was almost dry. Her long, glossy hair was neatly combed, and the stray strands were tucked behind her small ears, shaped like seashells.
 

 
Jiang Dang gently pinched her ear. "It’s dry now."
 

 
"Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
Zhao Zai picked up her bowl and walked to the kitchen sink, willingly starting to wash the dishes. She had almost no experience with housework, but this task didn’t need any special training—it just depended on how serious one was. She held the sponge with her small hands, scrubbing vigorously, cleaning every spot, even the little grooves at the bottom of the bowl. She only placed it in the sterilizing cabinet after it was thoroughly cleaned.
 

 
Zhao Zai wiped her hands dry.
 

 
Still not feeling sleepy after eating, Zhao Zai thought for a moment and then walked over to ask the elder: "Brother Dang, can I walk around the yard for a bit? My stomach feels a bit too full~"
 

 
"I’ll go with you."
 

 
Jiang Dang took her hand, which was still cold from washing the dishes, and wrapped his large hand around her small, pale hand, warming it for a moment. "Your hands are so cold."
 

 
Her fingertips, which had turned slightly red from the water, were gradually warmed up.
 

 
"I’m a little jealous."
 

 
"Jealous of what?" Zhao Zai asked, puzzled.
 

 
"If my hands were as cold as yours," Jiang Dang mused as he stared at her little face, "I could freeze your face."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Zhao Zai immediately became alert.
 

 
Unfortunately, after just cooking the noodles and drying the little one's hair with the blow dryer, Jiang Dang’s hands were warm, and he didn’t have the chance to freeze her. Instead, he held her hand and walked with her in the yard, with her in front and him following behind.
 

 
Under the moonlit night, everything was silent.
 

 
This didn’t seem like the time for a child to be awake and out, but Zhao Zai inexplicably felt a bit excited. Her little face was warm, and she felt like she could take on ten people. Her steps quickened, as if she were a little dog frolicking around.
 

 
Jiang Dang watched her small back, thinking to himself:
 

 
"Such a small one..."
 

 
"If I kicked her, she'd probably fly far."
 

 
…
 

 
Night-shift assistant director: "Is this content fit to be broadcast?"
 

 
"Ah," said the staff, "it seems like his agent has already given up on managing him."
 

 
There's no saving him now, just let him be.
 

 
Zhao Zai was hopping around joyfully, but the night road was unpredictable. In a moment of over-excitement, she nearly tripped and fell. However, Jiang Dang, quick on his feet, caught her in the middle of the fall, lifting her up like a little chick. Suspended in the air, Zhao Zai kicked her legs a little, hanging from his strong arm, her face trying hard to appear calm after being startled: "Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
She really tried hard to appear composed.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at her.
 

 
Just as the night-shift assistant director thought Jiang Dang might comfort the little girl, Jiang Dang said something completely random:
 

 
"You..."
 

 
"You kind of look like a weeble."
 

 
?
 

 
Zhao Zai’s small head was full of confusion.
 

 
What nonsense is this grown-up talking?
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped down from his arm.
 

 
After walking off the meal, she held Jiang Dang’s hand and headed back to the villa. She brushed her teeth and washed her face on her own. Before going to bed, she thanked her guardian:
 

 
"Thank you for making me supper."
 

 
It was really delicious.
 

 
Zhao Zai licked her lips in her mind.
 

 
"Mm, due to time constraints, otherwise I could’ve made it better," Jiang Dang said, sounding a bit regretful. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the chance to prepare his specialty molecular gastronomy dish—molecular cuisine usually takes a lot of time to prepare. Seeing that the little one was so hungry earlier, he had to settle for a simple dish instead, one that didn’t show off his culinary skills at all. "Sorry for making you eat this."
 

 
"No need to apologize, you can make it again next time~"
 

 
Unaware that she had narrowly avoided trouble, Zhao Zai tugged at Jiang Dang’s finger.
 

 
"Do you want me to tell you a bedtime story?"
 

 
Perhaps it was the warm soup noodles and the timely hug that helped Zhao Zai lower her guard. She blinked her eyes, tucked the blanket corner, and quietly said the truth: "I want to hear one.”
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
...
 

 
The night-shift assistant director suddenly became energized.
 

 
This was Jiang Dang’s bedtime story!
 

 
If turned into an audio recording, it would definitely be a popular selling point.
 

 
Just imagine, that low, gentle voice, softly narrating a hypnotic story in the quiet night, surely making one feel safe and drift off to sleep...
 

 
Jiang Dang sat by the bed. The small nightlight illuminated his side profile, making his already deep features appear even more striking and handsome. The shadow cast across the other side of his face looked like a dark mask, adding a sinister charm to his beauty.
 

 
Not only could he sing, but his voice also had a slight radio-like quality, captivating and smooth, weaving a story as if calling from some ancient source:
 

 
“Perhaps you’ve heard of Cthulhu?”
 

 
Zhao Zai: "I haven't."
 

 
The night-shift assistant director was stunned.
 

 
"It’s the ancient ruler, an indescribable terror…”
 

 
His voice was low and smooth, almost seductive.
 

 
When Jiang Dang told stories, the imagery and emotional depth were so powerful that Zhao Zai clutched the blanket and shivered. But she was also indeed tired, and despite her unease, she soon drifted into an anxious sleep…
 

 
In her dream, there was a giant octopus and countless eyes. She didn’t dare to look at anything.
 

 
Because gazing into Cthulhu’s eyes would drive one mad.
 

 
Zhao Zai’s face, pressed against the pillow while lying on her side, looked like a little rice cake. She was unsure of what she dreamed about, but her eyelashes and lips trembled slightly. Jiang Dang saw that she had fallen asleep and felt proud of how well he had taken care of her.
 

 
Sigh, maybe he had a talent for being a babysitter.
 

 
Meanwhile, the night-shift staff unanimously agreed that he must belong to some evil cult.
 

 
The next morning, Zhao Zai woke up early and, after quickly brushing her teeth and washing her face, sneakily made her way to Jiang Dang’s room to quietly sit and wait for him to wake up. She was alone in the children's room, always feeling as though mysterious eyes were watching her. But she didn’t dare to investigate, because in Brother Dang’s story, everyone who sought out that mysterious force was eventually driven mad by its terrifying power.
 

 
When Jiang Dang opened his eyes, he saw a neatly dressed little girl sitting up straight on the couch beside the bed.
 

 
She looked like a porcelain doll from a dollhouse.
 

 
"Up so early?"
 

 
Jiang Dang’s handsome face broke into a smile he thought was friendly. "Did you want to hear the continuation of last night’s story?"
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head rapidly, like a rattle.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team never expected that Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai’s pairing would go so smoothly.
 

 
They had originally thought there would be trouble on the first night.
 

 
But it turned out Jiang Dang was quite good at taking care of children.
 

 
Telling a kid a terrifying story about Cthulhu as a bedtime fairytale is a bit inhumane.
 

 
What about the other groups?
 

 
Zhang Shi and Xiao Quan spent a perfectly calm night.
 

 
Long Fei had no patience for taking care of children, so it was almost always Xie Zihan who was busy running around. When it came time for the bedtime story, Xie Zihan told Jia Jia the story of ‘Cinderella’, while Long Fei commented, "Of course, when there's a stepmother, there will be a stepfather too. Men can't be trusted."
 

 
"Men can't be trusted!" Jia Jia repeated, mimicking her.
 

 
Xie Zihan was a bit flustered: "Sister Fei, it's not good to say that in front of the kids..."
 

 
"What's wrong with that? They’ll need to know sooner or later. Men can’t be trusted!"
 

 
Jia Jia was curious: "So what can we trust?"
 

 
"Trust others, you’re a princess. Trust yourself, and you’re a queen."
 

 
...
 

 
The most chaotic group was Ye Xiaofan and Noah.
 

 
Noah was used to being a pampered young master, always having others take care of him, and Ye Xiaofan wasn’t much better. At school, he either ordered takeout or ate at the cafeteria and had never cooked before. The two of them arrived early at the villa, and after staring at each other for a while, Noah declared he was hungry.
 

 
After some thought, Ye Xiaofan found two bowls of instant noodles in the kitchen.
 

 
Noah turned his head and said he didn’t want that.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan: "Then what do you want to eat?"
 

 
Noah glanced at the kitchen, which was stocked with ingredients: "I want to eat a proper meal."
 

 
This seemed like a reasonable request.
 

 
Thinking she was here for a variety show and couldn’t look too incompetent, Ye Xiaofan reluctantly Googled some recipes while trying to make a dinner that was mediocre in taste, appearance, and smell. He didn’t like it himself, but at least it was homemade. After tasting a bite, it was passable—not undercooked, just a bit salty.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan called him to wash his hands and eat, but Noah sat in the corner without saying a word.
 

 
He glanced at the food: "I’m not eating this."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan picked up two pieces of stir-fried meat in front of him and ate them: "It’s not bad, though it’s not great either."
 

 
Noah put on a stern face, didn’t stay in the living room, and went straight to the game room to play with toys.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan watched his back and raised his voice: "Aren’t you eating?"
 

 
Noah muttered, "I’m not hungry, I’m not eating!"
 

 
After saying that, Noah distractedly played with his toys, waiting for the adults to bring a bowl and coax him to eat. This was his usual eating routine at home—if someone coaxed him, he could force himself to eat a little.
 

 
But after waiting and waiting, all he heard was Ye Xiaofan enjoying his meal in the living room, followed by the sound of him cleaning up the dishes.
 

 
Noah peeked his head out and looked around.
 

 
Where were the traces of the meal in the living room? There was only an instant noodle bowl. Ye Xiaofan had been too lazy to clean up, maybe thinking he’d want some later. The bowls were ceramic, and he didn’t want Noah to break them and hurt himself—Ye Xiaofan was a normal adult, so he considered safety, but coaxing someone to eat? That never crossed his mind.
 

 
After realizing that Ye Xiaofan had no intention of coaxing him, Noah suddenly lost interest in the toy in his hands.
 

 
In frustration, he threw the toy against the wall and sulked, thinking:
 

 
"I don’t care."
 

 
"I’m not hungry anyway. Those dishes looked disgusting."
 

 
Since it was the first day, the production team didn’t assign any interaction tasks to the guests. The idea was to allow the guests, both big and small, to relax and bond without the pressure of tasks. Seeing there were no tasks, Ye Xiaofan decided to spend his time looking for video game consoles in the villa. Sure enough, he found a Switch, a Wii, and a PS5, among others. He did ask Noah if he wanted to play, but Noah, crossing his arms, snorted, "They're all games I’m tired of playing."
 

 
Well then, I’ll just play by myself.
 

 
So, Ye Xiaofan played happily, feeling at ease.
 

 
However, Noah, who had been in a good mood at first, started getting angrier as the night went on.
 

 
"This adult won't even make me eat, and doesn’t care about my game time. He’s so bad!"
 

 
By the next day, Noah asked the host if he could switch parents!
 

 
The host was in a difficult position, as there was no precedent for this.
 

 
The other two kids, upon hearing this, were also reluctant. After all, they had finally gotten comfortable with their own parents. Though Xiao Quan liked the way Brother Fan danced, he had started to rely on Uncle Zhang Shi.
 

 
Seeing that no one else wanted to, Noah’s mood seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.
 

 
He pressed his lips tightly together, looking as though he was about to cry.
 

 
The production team quickly came up with a temporary solution: they would pair Noah and Xiao Zhao together and have them be in one family unit.
 

 
After all, based on Jiang Dang's performance on the first night, he seemed to know how to cook.
 

 
The host asked, “Is that okay?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao didn’t have the same resistance to Noah as the other kids. She looked at Noah, who was clearly on the verge of tears, and agreed. When it came to Jiang Dang, the host gave him a frantic look, fearing he might refuse.
 

 
If he refused, Noah's pride would really shatter.
 

 
The agent, watching this scene unfold on the live broadcast after waking up, couldn’t help but sigh, realizing the host still didn’t fully understand Jiang Dang.
 

 
Sure enough, when Jiang Dang saw the host’s signals, he looked confused. “You…”
 

 
The host responded, “Hmm?”
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, “Is your eye bothering you?”
 

 
The agent just wanted to say—
 

 
It’s a basic move, don’t laugh.
 

 
Fortunately, after understanding the host’s intentions, Jiang Dang not only agreed but did so enthusiastically. He looked at Noah with admiration: "Perfect, I was just thinking of making a nice lunch, and it’s such a waste for only one person to hear last night’s story. You’ve come at just the right time."
 

 
Upon hearing "last night’s story," the usually composed Xiao Zhao couldn’t help but nervously glance at Brother Dang:
 

 
"Actually, Brother Ye Xiaofan is really nice, why don’t you…"
 

 
"I want him!" Noah immediately cut in.
 

 
Hearing that Xiao Zhao seemed reluctant for Jiang Dang to take him, and following the principle of "what the enemy rejects is what I’ll fight for," Noah quickly stepped forward with his demand and looked at Xiao Zhao with a victorious gaze, ignoring her implied warning to "run away.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao was speechless: "Fine."
 

 
Brother Dang's cooking is delicious, and it should be enough to make up for the psychological trauma caused by the stories he told.
 

 
Noah, the young master, was full of confidence and kept pressing on:
 

 
"I didn’t eat last night, and now I’m so hungry! I want him to only cook for me. You can eat the food that guy made. Once you’ve eaten it, you’ll understand why I won’t eat his cooking."
 

 
It was getting close to noon, and the live broadcast of the variety show was slowly attracting viewers.
 

 
[This little brat’s looks are proportional to how annoying he is.]
 

 
[He’s obviously been spoiled.]
 

 
[Why is he bullying Xiao Zhao? Xiao Zhao, beat him up! Jiang Dang couldn’t even beat Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
...
 

 
What the audience hoped to see—Xiao Zhao pinning the young master to the ground and beating him up—was obviously not going to happen at this stage.
 

 
Before facing major changes, Xiao Zhao was a well-mannered young lady who set high standards for herself. She tolerated Noah’s behavior with a glance, ready to argue with him, but when she saw Ye Xiaofan’s frustrated expression, she chose to take care of the other adult’s pride instead. "You want to eat the food Brother Dang made, right?"
 

 
"Mm-hmm."
 

 
"Then I also want to eat the food Brother Ye made."
 

 
Xiao Zhao gave Jiang Dang a look to show she wasn’t rejecting him; it was just a temporary measure. Then she walked over to Ye Xiaofan, tugging at his sleeve to show encouragement. Ye Xiaofan felt both frustrated and hurt—didn’t he enjoy eating instant noodles? If it weren’t for taking care of this little brat, would he really need to spend time searching on Baidu and slaving away in the kitchen?
 

 
Looking down, he saw the clear, almost translucent deer-like eyes of the little girl, and his heart melted.
 

 
"Okay, okay, I’ll make whatever you want to eat!"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan squatted down and hugged the little angel.
 

 
Xiao Zhao hadn’t expected this, and her face showed an almost breathless expression. She forced herself to pat his head. "Good..."
 

 
Sigh, adults are really hard to take care of!
 

 
Seeing everything under his control, Noah raised his chin with a victorious smile.
 

 
This was the situation he was most familiar with.
 

 
All the adults were revolving around him, catering to his needs, focusing on him, and treating him like the center of attention.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at him and asked:
 

 
"So, are you going to finish the food I make for you?"
 

 
Feeling victorious, Noah was in a great mood and patted his chest, promising:
 

 
"I’ve been starving all night; I can eat a whole cow now! As long as it’s not the food he made, I’ll finish it all! If I don’t, I’m a dog!"
 

 
To let the guests show off their cooking skills, the villa was stocked with plenty of ingredients.
 

 
Even the more difficult-to-find ingredients could be delivered by the host within five minutes—after all, it was just the program team adjusting the data, and the ingredient codes were very cheap.
 

 
But the four sardines, eel, nutmeg, pig’s blood, chocolate, and bananas Jiang Dang requested…
 

 
What exactly was he planning to cook?
 

 
Watching Jiang Dang preparing to serve this bratty little young master, Ye Xiaofan’s initial hostility toward him not only dissipated but even gave way to a sense of shared camaraderie. “I didn’t expect you to look so unreliable, yet you actually know how to cook?”
 

 
“Basic survival skills for studying abroad,” Jiang Dang replied.
 

 
Wearing an apron, he exuded a homely vibe. The steam rising from the pot softened his silhouette, adding an air of reliability.
 

 
“I studied in the UK for a while.”
# Chapter123
“How long is this going to take?”
 

 
Noah, who hadn’t eaten dinner last night, was so hungry that his stomach was pressing against his back. Though Ye Xiaofan had made a quick breakfast this morning, Noah still held a grudge against him for not inviting him to play the game (he’d only invited him once). He thought to himself that unless Ye Xiaofan begged him, he wouldn’t eat a single bite...
 

 
In the end, he really didn’t get any food.
 

 
“Man dies for money, child dies for food,” Noah decided to lower his proud head just a little. It was impossible for him to bow down to Ye Xiaofan, who he held a grudge against, but he could at least show some favor to Jiang Dang, whom he’d stolen from Tong Zhao. Even if he didn’t ask, he’d still obediently eat the food this time.
 

 
There was no choice, he was too hungry.
 

 
Noah wandered around the kitchen, the smell of food drifting to his nose, stirring the hunger inside him. His stomach growled, and he couldn’t hold back any longer. He reluctantly went over to Jiang Dang to hurry him up.
 

 
“I need some time to cook,” Jiang Dang said without being moved. “If you can’t wait, you can eat what Ye Xiaofan made.”
 

 
“I’m not eating what he made.”
 

 
Noah snorted coldly.
 

 
Though he snorted, upon hearing Jiang Dang say that, Noah still held back and sat at the dining table, playing with his phone and waiting. Every now and then, he would glance toward the kitchen, but all he could see was the rising steam.
 

 
At that moment, what kept him going wasn’t just his pride.
 

 
It was also Jiang Dang’s cooking skills.
 

 
Noah had observed Ye Xiaofan cooking last night.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was squinting at the recipe on his phone while stirring the food, his brows furrowed. He looked at the dish like it was an enemy. When adding the seasoning, he hesitated. Could something good come out of this? Noah wasn’t holding out any hope. It looked like slop, and even though Ye Xiaofan was eating it happily, Noah only thought that he’d never had anything better.
 

 
But then he looked at Jiang Dang.
 

 
After putting on an apron, Jiang Dang looked like one of those skilled men on Douyin, confidently and gracefully cooking. His movements were smooth and practiced, showing that he was a seasoned cook. He knew exactly how much seasoning to use, never foolishly measuring salt with a cup. And as for the dish...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan’s was just home cooking.
 

 
Tomato scrambled eggs, stir-fried green peppers with shredded pork—Noah was sick of that.
 

 
But when he looked at Jiang Dang, he saw him flattening a dough disc and placing it into a container, shaping it into a pie crust.
 

 
Though he didn’t know exactly what Jiang Dang was making, it clearly looked very fancy.
 

 
It was food Noah had never seen before.
 

 
Looking at the ingredients, there was also chocolate and bananas.
 

 
Noah liked both of those, and then there was eel. He was craving Japanese grilled eel rice, just thinking about it made him hungry.
 

 
Noah kicked his legs, glancing over at Tong Zhao beside him.
 

 
She wasn’t on her phone, holding a notebook and doing homework. This was something she had asked the host for—she was worried about falling behind in her studies, but she wouldn’t let it interfere with the show or playing games. She would study during breaks.
 

 
Listen, is that even something a child would say?
 

 
Noah found it hard to believe.
 

 
His own parents had also wanted him to bring his homework, saying that subconsciously he should maintain a competitive spirit, but unfortunately, the little master had torn up his homework on the spot, saying he wouldn’t do it. Noah sneaked a glance at the problems Tong Zhao was working on...
 

 
Shit.
 

 
He couldn’t understand it.
 

 
Noah was secretly angry:
 

 
“You think doing this will make the adults think you’re obedient and like you more?”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him: “Are you talking to me?”
 

 
“Well, who else?”
 

 
“How strange,” Tong Zhao said in confusion, “Even if I don’t do my homework, the adults still like me a lot.”
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao was so cute and confident!
 

 
The comments flooded with laughter, especially from Tong Zhao’s fans, who kept agreeing, saying that no matter what Tong Zhao did or didn’t do, Mommy and Daddy always loved her the most. While Noah was still stunned, Ye Xiaofan came out with a big smile, holding two dishes: “Dinner’s ready. Do you want to finish your homework first?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head, jumping off her chair: “I’ll go serve the food for Brother Ye, wait for me, Brother~”
 

 
...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, who had been ignored all day by Noah the day before and criticized by the brat in the morning, was now warmed to the core. AI detected his current feelings—
 

 
"So kids can be this cute too, I take back everything I said about human children being little terrors. I will always love Tong Zhao! Ah, her little voice calling me ‘brother’ is so sweet, sob, I really want a little sister. I should’ve let my mom have a second child last time..."
 

 
At this moment, Ye Xiaofan glanced at Noah sitting next to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"...Never mind, what if she has a little brother instead? The risk is too great."
 

 
"Can I take Tong Zhao home after the show?"
 

 
His heartfelt words about only wanting a little sister and not a little brother made the audience laugh.
 

 
Normally, words like this would spark rumors.
 

 
But this is little Tong Zhao, who is miles away from the idea of early romance. Even the fans who adore Ye Xiaofan and consider him the perfect boyfriend wouldn't be jealous of a little loli. Besides, when their older brother was ignored by Noah and bullied by the brat, they all suppressed their anger, feeling sorry for their brother. Now, seeing him so healed and acting like a silly big brother, they even felt grateful to Tong Zhao.
 

 
If it weren’t for Tong Zhao, Ye Xiaofan would have been bullied by the brat to the point of questioning his life.
 

 
After all, the production team hadn’t tried to pair up Tong Zhao with any other male guests in a romantic way. The fans could sense the direction of the show and had accepted the sibling dynamic for the two of them.
 

 
A sweet and obedient little sister was simply impossible to feel resentful toward.
 

 
However…
 

 
[? You can't just take Tong Zhao away, she belongs to everyone!]
 

 
[Want to take away my cloud-raised little one?? There’s something seriously wrong with you!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is bearing a workload of homework that she shouldn’t even have to deal with at her age. By the way, do kids like this who voluntarily do their homework even exist in real life?]
 

 
Tong Zhao seriously served up two bowls of rice.
 

 
One bowl was a little more full, piled into a nice-looking pyramid shape, and the other was slightly less, about two-thirds full. Ye Xiaofan watched her work with her short legs, moving back and forth like a little Q-version character in a mobile game. His internal balance between “helping her” and “watching her a little longer” swung back and forth, with both choices feeling equally attractive.
 

 
Although her legs were short, Tong Zhao worked quickly and efficiently. She placed the fuller bowl in front of Ye Xiaofan: “I’m done, Brother Ye, eat.”
 

 
“Alright, thank you.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan took the bowl, which was warm to the touch.
 

 
But it wasn’t just rice in that bowl—
 

 
It was the love of his little sister for him!
 

 
This time, in order to impress his little sister, Ye Xiaofan worked extra hard. Compared to yesterday, he had made some progress. The food smelled rich and savory, the twice-cooked pork stir-fried to the perfect color, and the half-fat, half-lean pork gleaming with enticing oil. What touched the audience the most, however, was the small bowl of stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers placed in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This small bowl in front of Tong Zhao had only the shredded pork, no green peppers.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had picked out the peppers just for her while cooking in the kitchen.
 

 
[Ye Xiaofan looks like the most rebellious and arrogant young man in the world, but who knew he could be so thoughtful and warm?]
 

 
[He says he wants a sister like Tong Zhao, but honestly, I wish I had a brother like him!]
 

 
[This is so sweet, and the food looks pretty good too. It's not as bad as the brat says!]
 

 
The two of them chatted and laughed while eating, and the atmosphere was fantastic.
 

 
At the same table, Noah sat there sulking. Every breath he took only made the tempting smell of meat stronger, and his phone had lost its appeal. Even though he was looking through the lens of disdain for Ye Xiaofan, the aroma was still incredibly enticing. He almost wanted to stop breathing, but he also felt that getting up and leaving the table would make him seem weak.
 

 
[I don’t want to eat at all!]
 

 
[Why is Jiang Dang not done yet…]
 

 
[I’m so hungry, why isn’t anyone asking if I want to eat…]
 

 
With a stomach full of grievances, Noah lowered his head, his eyes red and his nose tip tingling, looking like he was about to cry.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan ate heartily, clearly enjoying his meal.
 

 
He felt that all the emotional damage he had suffered from the brat was completely healed by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Plus, he was indeed hungry, so he ate quickly, not even thinking of leaving any food for Noah. After all, Noah said he didn’t want to eat, and Ye Xiaofan felt that he was respecting the kid's wishes, never forcing him to eat – he remembered when he was young, there were times when he felt bad and didn’t want to eat, and his parents would just leave him alone to calm down.
 

 
Just as Noah was on the verge of tears, Jiang Dang’s cool, soft voice, like a heavenly melody, came from the kitchen:
 

 
“It's done. Go serve yourself.”
 

 
“Don’t take too much, one serving is the main dish. The rice is for mixing with the eel jelly.”
 

 
As soon as he heard this, Noah couldn’t hold his pride any longer. He obediently went to serve himself two bowls of rice.
 

 
When he returned with the rice, the dishes Jiang Dang had made were already on the table.
 

 
Noah froze.
 

 
The audience froze too.
 

 
Most of the audience had been thoroughly entertained by Ye Xiaofan and Tong Zhao’s interactions earlier. Jiang Dang’s cooking process had been long and drawn out, and except for his fans, most viewers hadn’t paid much attention to it. But now, when the food was served, it exceeded their expectations—
 

 
A pie.
 

 
On top of the pie were the heads of four sardines.
 

 
Each fish head’s eye had been roasted white, like they were rolling their eyes, looking exactly like the zombies in the zombie movies Noah had watched. Staring at these eight eyes, Noah found himself frozen.
 

 
Only after seeing these four pairs of eyes could one truly understand what it meant to die with one’s eyes wide open.
 

 
Noah’s whole body stiffened.
 

 
Jiang Dang took off his apron, his movements casual and graceful. He glanced at the rice Noah had served and was satisfied with his obedience. He speared one of the sardine heads with a fork and placed it into Noah’s smaller bowl of rice: “Eat.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this even edible?
 

 
Can it really be eaten?
 

 
Noah shuddered. He really wanted to throw a tantrum and refuse to eat.
 

 
But the man who made this terrifying dish was sitting right across from him, his expression cold and indifferent.
 

 
Unlike the more easily understood Ye Xiaofan, Jiang Dang, known for being a professional villain, was full of mysterious, inscrutable qualities. His deep-set eyes were cold and menacing, not someone you could easily mess with. And let's not forget his graceful but chilling way of speaking.
 

 
Noah looked up at Jiang Dang, then down at the fish head assigned to his bowl.
 

 
It felt...
 

 
Equally terrifying on both sides!
 

 
He also remembered what he'd said earlier, that if he didn’t finish, he would be a dog…
 

 
With a stiff upper lip, Noah pushed the fish head to the side of the bowl.
 

 
[Hmm, I’ll eat this later.]
 

 
[I'll try the other dishes first!]
 

 
Noah was so hungry; he felt like everything would taste good now.
 

 
If it weren’t for that fish head looking so scary, he probably could have eaten it.
 

 
"Which one is the eel?" he asked.
 

 
Jiang Dang motioned toward the porcelain plate on the right with a slight tilt of his chin.
 

 
The dish on the porcelain plate didn’t look like the eel Noah knew.
 

 
The eel Noah recognized was dark brown, glossy with soy sauce, and when cut, the flesh was white and tender. But this fish on the plate, though white, looked a bit strange, its flesh wrapped in a translucent gelatinous layer...
 

 
The live stream’s comments quickly filled with special bullet screens.
 

 
All of them condensed into eight words:
 

 
Quick, quick, quick, quick
 

 
Run, run, run, run
 

 
Noah gathered his courage and picked up a piece. The eel jelly trembled and landed on the rice. He quickly shoveled two bites of rice into his mouth, but the expected rich flavor didn’t come. Instead, the slippery and cool texture made him feel like he might vomit.
 

 
It wasn’t overly fishy, but it had a slight lingering fishiness, and the taste was very subtle.
 

 
Although the audience didn’t get to eat it, from the look of Noah’s scrunched-up face…
 

 
[People on diets thank Jiang Dang.]
 

 
"If you don’t like that, you can try the black pudding," Jiang Dang said softly.
 

 
At the mention of black pudding, Noah’s eyes lit up.
 

 
He’d had pudding before, and it was sweet and delicious.
 

 
Remembering the chocolate he had seen among the ingredients earlier, Noah lowered his guard against the dark, mysterious item. It must taste like chocolate! He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth, his face scrunching up again in disgust.
 

 
[Can someone please tell me what this black pudding really is?]
 

 
[There are sausages with pig’s blood in them; you can imagine they taste like our pig’s blood.]
 

 
[Is it hard to eat?]
 

 
[It’s not exactly bad, but kids probably won’t like it.]
 

 
Noah gritted his teeth and ate bite after bite.
 

 
The taste was so strange, and the fish head with its fish eyes was terrifying. His eyelids reddened, and his eyelashes trembled...
 

 
Even though he was a rebellious child who usually didn’t care about anything, this moment—forcing himself to eat strange food out of pride despite being scared—still tugged at the hearts of many viewers. Some even urged the production team to stop him from eating. The production team explained with white text that the food Jiang Dang made was not only very safe but also rich in nutritional value, so it was absolutely fine for kids to eat.
 

 
As Noah ate, he finally couldn’t hold back and tears dropped down.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan noticed: “... Are you crying?”
 

 
“Ah,” Jiang Dang answered before Noah could: “It must be because I made it so delicious, it made you cry from the deliciousness.”
 

 
The bullet screen quickly filled with a lot of question marks.
 

 
It was as though Jiang Dang was the kind of man who could speak so quickly that the question marks couldn’t keep up with his speed.
 

 
Noah finished his meal with difficulty.
 

 
Jiang Dang, on the other hand, ate with great enjoyment, relaxing and at ease, showing no sign that he had made some terrifying dark cuisine. It seemed he was really used to eating this kind of food and didn’t find anything wrong with it.
 

 
Noah, with tears in his eyes, thought:
 

 
[Does he think I’m a bad kid and is doing this on purpose?]
 

 
Then he looked up and saw that Jiang Dang not only enjoyed his meal but also refilled his bowl.
 

 
Noah felt like he had been struck by lightning.
 

 
[This big brother is really too scary!]
 

 
The bullet screen quickly congratulated Noah for realizing the truth.
 

 
However, Noah had originally said he would "swap parents." Although they were under the same roof, his parents had now been replaced by Jiang Dang. So, he could only watch Ye Xiaofan and Xiao Zhao play normal games, while he secretly glanced at Jiang Dang…
 

 
Noah really wanted to act tough.
 

 
But in front of this man, he felt a bit weak, as if a mouse had encountered a cat.
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the couch and waved for him to come over.
 

 
The man, full and satisfied, stretched his long legs with ease. His thin lips curved into a smile that seemed both present and absent, looking so attractive it made people lower their guard.
 

 
“Would you like to listen to a story?”
 

 
His voice carried a soft warmth, like when he occasionally showed mercy and wrote sweet, cheesy love songs that became popular as background music for many TikTok users. This warm voice captivated Noah’s fragile little heart.
 

 
[Although... listening to a story seems a little cheesy…]
 

 
[But it’s not that bad.]
 

 
Noah awkwardly sat down next to Jiang Dang. "If it's just for me to hear, then I'll listen."
 

 
Jiang Dang glanced at Xiao Zhao, who was having a great time playing with Ye Xiaofan, and smiled with a hint of regret.
 

 
"Alright, I'll only say it for you to hear.”
# Chapter124
Fifteen minutes had passed.
 

 
When Zhao Zai and Ye Xiaofan returned to the living room, sweaty from playing with the motion-sensing game console, they were greeted by a strange sight—
 

 
The usually cool and composed young master, who had managed to hold out despite being hungry all night, was tightly clutching the sofa cushion on his lap. His eyes and the tip of his nose were red, as if he were trying hard to hold back tears.
 

 
Earlier, Zhao Zai had been playing the role of a cat demon in the game, and now, she was even more lively than usual, letting go of her usual formal demeanor. She peeked into the living room, casually meowing as if to intentionally act cute, and in that single "meow," countless viewers' hearts melted. The barrage was flooded with "awsl" (a shorthand for "I’m in love").
 

 
But it was that sudden "meow" that unexpectedly broke Noah’s last shred of rationality.
 

 
He threw the pillow aside, jumped off the sofa, and while running, he wailed loudly, "Wah... I... I want to go home... Wuuu... I don’t want you guys, don’t kill me..."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan stared in disbelief at Jiang Dang, sitting on the sofa. "Did you hit him?"
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang innocently looked back at him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought the same.
 

 
The only thing Jiang Dang had to do with violence was being slapped by a female celebrity...
 

 
Who was that female celebrity again? It seemed like part of his memory had been clouded or erased, Ye Xiaofan couldn't recall. After pondering for a while, he gave up on trying to remember. "Damn it, I'm no good at comforting kids."
 

 
"I’ll go," Zhao Zai sighed as she left.
 

 
...
 

 
After Zhao Zai left, Ye Xiaofan puzzled, "What did you do to him? He’s crying so badly.”
 

 
"I told him a bedtime story."
 

 
Jiang Dang's gaze was clear, and Ye Xiaofan could almost sense a hint of "what did the child do wrong" in his expression. But his intuition told him that the blame squarely fell on Jiang Dang. There was no one else to blame. He was suspicious and asked, "Really?"
 

 
"Really."
 

 
Jiang Dang tilted his head slightly.
 

 
The barrage quickly added a caption:
 
"What bad intentions can a psychopath have?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan almost believed him. He asked what kind of scary bedtime story he had told.
 

 
"It was Stephen King's novel ‘The Mist’. Well, it was more of an adaptation. It would take too long to tell the entire story, but when I was studying in the UK, I always used his books as bedtime reading, reading them over and over again. When I thought of a story to tell, this one came to mind first."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a gentle smile: "Do you want to hear it?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan looked at his smile, almost mesmerized, and mindlessly nodded.
 

 
By the time he finished listening to Jiang Dang’s story, Ye Xiaofan felt dazed.
 

 
How to explain it?
 

 
It wasn’t exactly a very scary story, but the overwhelming sense of despair, helplessness, and mysterious terror, along with Jiang Dang’s soft voice, fit together perfectly. The two sentences he spoke slowly drew the listener into that foggy, monster-filled world: "The most absurd part is that the protagonist felt there was no escape. Dying at the hands of the monster was painful and humiliating. In his desperation, after ending his own family’s suffering, he… suddenly found that rescue really had arrived? This ending is so soul-crushing, so mind-bending. Can this kind of content even be aired?"
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel Ye Xiaofan’s unease.
 

 
Forget about bedtime stories—if he heard this kind of story during the day, he would probably be so disturbed that he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.
 

 
Jiang Dang actually used that as bedtime reading material!
 

 
There were so many things to criticize that Ye Xiaofan couldn’t even process them all at once. He only managed to come up with one comment: "Jiang Dang, sometimes... your voice kind of sounds like tentacles."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a smile, as if he had received a compliment.
 

 
On the other side, the rebellious young master Noah was at his limit.
 

 
He instinctively retreated into a dark, secluded corner where he felt safe, biting his arm to stifle his sobs. His tears flowed in large drops, and his mind was filled with all sorts of grotesque and terrifying creatures, lurking everywhere.
 

 
Jiang Dang felt that his skills at taking care of children had improved.
 

 
Last night, when he told Tong Zhao a bedtime story, it was very rigid and straightforward. Today, he had refined his storytelling technique, switching to a second-person narrative that was more immersive, with interactive questions like, “You hurried into a supermarket in a panic. The cashier has been facing away from you for a long time, and even after hearing your footsteps, doesn’t turn around. Do you want to ask them what’s going on around here?” This technique aimed to enhance the sense of immersion for the child.
 

 
The villa was huge, and Noah was fast enough to run at full speed. Tong Zhao had to check each room to find him.
 

 
In the end, she heard faint crying from inside the children’s room closet.
 

 
She opened the door and saw a small figure huddled inside.
 

 
Noah had his face buried in his arm, curled up among the clothes, looking like a mushroom growing in the corner, drooping and wilted.
 

 
"You’re crying," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"I’m not crying! Go away!" Noah snapped fiercely.
 

 
His "go away" caused some strong reactions in the comments.
 

 
Some felt that Tong Zhao shouldn’t bother with him and should just let him deal with it himself.
 

 
Others thought that although his attitude was bad, he wasn’t throwing tantrums, breaking furniture, or cursing adults. He was just refusing to eat and letting himself go hungry, so he wasn’t really that much of a troublemaker after all.
 

 
[He’s so fierce.]
 

 
[I need to figure out a way to make him stop being so fierce.]
 

 
The smart AI detected Zhao Zai’s thoughts, and the next moment, they heard her clearing her throat and imitating Jiang Dang’s tone with a little sweet voice, asking, “Excuse me, little friend, may I take up some of your time? I’d like to talk to you about our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Cthulhu…”
 

 
“...Waaa!!!”
 

 
At the sound of that tone, Noah’s scalp went numb, and he shrank even more into a tiny ball.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[This is the real devil, isn’t it!!!]
 

 
[Pure evil from the start, this mischievous kid doesn’t stand a chance against them, run!]
 

 
Noah wasn’t just crying out of fear; he also felt very wronged.
 

 
No one here was focusing on him, trying to comfort him or indulge him.
 

 
He had endured his hunger to preserve his dignity, thinking that once he made it through, things would get better. But instead, he was forced to eat strange, unappetizing food, while the little girl next to him got to enjoy normal, tasty meals and seemed so happy about it. All the accumulated grievances, combined with Jiang Dang's terrifying story, finally broke his resolve.
 

 
Zhao Zai furrowed her brow, sensing that the situation wasn’t simple.
 

 
[Actually, I don’t really have experience comforting others…]
 

 
[And I don’t think I’ve ever been comforted either.]
 

 
Amidst the little boy’s cries, Zhao Zai vaguely recalled some memories—someone once praised her for being born strong, with a strong sense of mission in whatever she did, being too strict with herself, unwilling to show weakness to others, and never giving anyone a chance to pity her…
 

 
Who said that again?
 

 
I can't remember.
 

 
This sentence was a bit too complicated for Zhao Zai. After thinking for a while, she felt a headache and decided not to think about it anymore.
 

 
Zhao Zai sighed in her heart, opened her arms, and hugged him.
 

 
A thousand words couldn’t compare to a warm hug~
 

 
“Yes, it’s me, I’m here. If the sky falls, I’ll hold it up. What Jiang Dang said was all fake. I also heard him tell a scary story last night and had a nightmare, so you’re not the only one who’s scared.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Noah shuddered a bit, lifted his face from his arm, and secretly looked at her.
 

 
“It’s not good. He… he said at the end of the story… that once you hear it, you should never think about it again, because if you think about it, then… it’s….” Noah hiccuped with fear and tears. “Thinking about it is like calling it. If you think about it too much, it’ll notice you. But I… I just can’t stop thinking about it…”
 

 
The little boy anxiously bumped his head against the wardrobe.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[Jiang Dang is truly inhuman, there wasn’t such a setting in the original ‘The Mist’, he added that part himself!]
 

 
[He’s a true genius of ghost stories, how could you not think about it!]
 

 
When Noah hit the wardrobe for the third time, his forehead bumped into something soft.
 

 
[...What did I just bump into?]
 

 
Noah blinked through his teary eyes, confused and puzzled.
 

 
Zhao Zai: “It’s a tentacle.”
 

 
Noah: “!!!”
 

 
"I was joking," Zhao Zai raised his chin with one hand. "It’s my hand."
 

 
Noah saw a delicate, soft hand.
 

 
He bit his lip, remembering how hard he had just bumped into it. "Did I hurt you? What’s wrong with you, why did you put your hand up..."
 

 
His voice, still soft and childish from crying, was gentle and tender.
 

 
"A little, but I didn’t want you to hurt your head either."
 

 
Zhao Zai’s eyes, shining like tiny fireflies in the dark, were clear and enchanting.
 

 
Under her steady gaze, Noah suddenly couldn’t bring himself to say anything harsh.
 

 
His face was burning hot, like it was on fire, just like the first time he saw her.
 

 
Children awaken to love far earlier than adults can imagine. The concept of avoiding early relationships like a plague is unique to Chinese schools, and while there may be some truth to it, human emotions can’t be confined or erased. It’s like a little green sprout quietly pushing up from the earth after the rain, the seed having fallen without notice, and the nourishment unknown. It may never bloom, but it will leave behind a small, beautiful thought for a lifetime.
 

 
Simple, untainted.
 

 
"You... you're silly..."
 

 
Noah grabbed her hand roughly and rubbed it against his palm where he had bumped it earlier.
 

 
He had been too frantic before, not recalling how hard he had hit.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to say that the back of his hand, which had slammed into the wardrobe, hurt more, but his rubbing actually hurt too. "It doesn't hurt, let me give you a hug. I'm here for you."
 

 
As she spoke, she patted his back.
 

 
Noah flared up. "Are you treating me like a little kid?"
 

 
Loli, confused: "Aren’t you a little kid?”
 

 
Innocent deer-like eyes fixedly looked at him.
 

 
The adults at home never acknowledged his needs. The only way Noah could get their attention was by crying or throwing a tantrum — because when he became too much of a hassle, the adults had no choice but to take him seriously. If he behaved and listened quietly, his needs, his thoughts, and his feelings would all be ignored.
 

 
Over time, Noah forgot how to communicate with others in a normal way.
 

 
Even in this moment, when warmth filled his chest, Noah couldn’t find the right words to say.
 

 
He thought and thought, countless words passing his lips, only to be swallowed back down.
 

 
Finally, he mumbled an apology in a voice as soft as a mosquito's hum:
 

 
"...Sorry."
 

 
"Sorry for what?"
 

 
"Just..."
 

 
He whispered even more quietly.
 

 
In the big wardrobe, two little children hid, mumbling to each other.
 

 
Noah didn’t like to soften, didn’t like to apologize.
 

 
"I only apologize to you. You’re not allowed to tell anyone else!"
 

 
"And also, you can't bring up this apology with me again."
 

 
He said it in a fierce tone.
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded vigorously.
 

 
"We're speaking so softly in the wardrobe, they definitely can't hear us."
 

 
At this moment, the live stream of "Baby Chaos" had already surpassed 200,000 viewers.
# Chapter125
Once Noah stopped hiccupping from crying, Zhao Zai took him to the bathroom to wash his face.
 

 
Zhao Zai had the mentality of an older sibling, wanting to keep an eye on him even while he washed his face. However, the little boy, his face red with embarrassment, gently pushed her out — this time, it was a soft push without much force, but his attitude was firm: "You go out, I can wash my face by myself."
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused: "Are you going to pee?"
 

 
"I'm not!" Noah loudly denied it. "I went in first, so this place is the men's bathroom now. You're a girl, you can't come in."
 

 
This logic convinced Zhao Zai.
 

 
She indeed couldn't enter the men's bathroom, so she had no choice but to stand outside with a face full of regret.
 

 
The audience watched as the small Zhao Zai stood with her back to the bathroom door, raising her voice: "Be careful washing your face~ Remember to scrub your hands for at least thirty seconds!"
 

 
"I know, you're so annoying!" Noah quickly retorted from inside the bathroom, scrubbing his hands with such speed that his little claws seemed to be on fire.
 

 
Once the shyness passed, Noah came out, now calmer, and quickly whispered in the little girl's ear: "When I said you were annoying, I didn't mean it. I wasn't scolding you!"
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Zhao Zai raised her hand and touched her ear.
 

 
This child really likes to speak loudly in her ear. She might go deaf.
 

 
---
 

 
Behind the scenes, the production team could clearly see that this temporary family had the highest viewership ratings.
 

 
The combination of Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao was a real attention-grabber.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was more or less riding their coattails.
 

 
At first, Noah's popularity among the audience was quite low. However, as he interacted more with Zhao Zai, all the data showed that the public's perception of him was improving, and the irrational insults toward him were decreasing significantly.
 

 
The staff on the afternoon shift sighed:
 

 
"Mini version of Zhao Zai is really an angel. Whoever she plays with becomes really likable."
 

 
The female screenwriter watched for a while and said, "I think she’s the type who naturally gets a lot of attention and everyone expects her to do amazing things, but it’s easy to overlook that she’s just a little girl who needs care and love from adults."
 

 
This little girl, who was more self-disciplined and responsible than many adults, naturally reached out and took Noah's hand, leading him back to the living room.
 

 
Perhaps after talking to Jiang Dang for a while, Ye Xiaofan caught the habit of mentioning things best left unsaid, and asked right away: "Where did you go to cry just now?"
 

 
Noah glared at him: "I didn't cry! Do you have any proof?"
 

 
Ah...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan couldn't help but notice his red, swollen eyes.
 

 
Before he could ask again, Zhao Zai quickly took over the conversation: "I was the one who cried, and Noah was comforting me."
 

 
She took small steps forward and tugged at the two big brothers:
 

 
"We’re a family now, right? Let’s all play the game together later~"
 

 
[I'm declaring Zhao Zai as the emotional intelligence ceiling of this family.]
 

 
[Then what about Jiang Dang? Is he the emotional intelligence floor?]
 

 
[He must be the emotional intelligence basement.]
 

 
[He’s so deep, we’ve reached the center of the earth, don’t mention it.]
 

 
As the saying goes, "the rich help the poor." The production team, aiming for balanced attention, decided to add group games and activities for all the guests to participate in. While Zhao Zai excelled at everything, she didn't have the habit of grabbing attention or trying to be the center of focus, and was more than happy to let other children take the spotlight.
 

 
Xiao Quan was timid and often stood quietly on the side, feeling a little down.
 

 
So, the two who most fiercely tried to avoid attention were Jia Jia and Noah. Neither of them was willing to give in, especially when it came to the privilege of playing with Zhao Zai. In the end, it usually resulted in Jia Jia slightly outperforming Noah.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "going to the bathroom together" was a privilege for same-gender children.
 

 
No matter how powerless and angry Noah got, his face turning red...
 

 
He simply couldn’t bring himself to invite Zhao Zai to hold hands and go to the bathroom together.
 

 
Although the younger guests were all quite attached to Zhao Zai, she hadn’t forgotten her original mission. She took time to teach Jiang Dang the simplest ballet steps. Jiang Dang didn’t treat it as just a trick to win her over but studied it seriously, even showing off a small routine at the end of the program.
 

 
Jiang Dang took it seriously, and Zhao Zai, as the little teacher, was quite pleased.
 

 
However, in the live stream, Jiang Dang’s female fans were covering their faces, unable to resist peeking through their fingers. After watching, they couldn’t get enough and even took screenshots as souvenirs.
 

 
When a man wears ballet tights, the size is clearly visible.
 

 
Even when he wasn’t in battle mode, it was still quite astonishing.
 

 
The comments flooded in:
 

 
[Is this content even allowed to air???]
 

 
[If it weren’t for your comments, no one would think that way!]
 

 
[Is Jiang Dang a 1? Is he a 1? Is he a 1?]
 

 
[My big straight man, thank you.]
 

 
Before the program ended, there was a small incident.
 

 
As Noah spent more time interacting with the other two little guests during the activities, they became friends. But whenever he thought about leaving the show and having to travel with his parents again, alone without any playmates, he would feel so sad that he secretly shed tears. He wished he could hide so the adults wouldn’t find him, and the show wouldn’t have to end.
 

 
The production team also invited the real parents of the little guests to watch the live broadcast in the studio. They filmed their reactions and interviewed them about their thoughts.
 

 
In a holographic variety show, where could they hide?
 

 
Moreover, Noah’s hiding spot wasn’t very clever. After a small hint from the production team, Zhao Zai found him again.
 

 
The three little guests promised that they would keep in touch after the show ended and that they would still be good friends.
 

 
After Jia Jia and Xiao Quan spoke, Noah was already wiping his tears.
 

 
Just as Zhao Zai was about to say something, Noah shook his head forcefully: “Don’t be friends!”
 

 
[Advice to the child: Don’t be ungrateful.]
 

 
[Is he turning his back on Zhao?]
 

 
[This kid is ungrateful.]
 

 
Because, on the show, Zhao Zai had been very caring toward him, and the audience jokingly called her "the one who brought an extra son," like a big treasure looking after a little treasure.
 

 
However, the next moment, Noah’s words stunned the audience—
 

 
“After we go out, I want you to be my bride.”
 

 
Noah’s light brown eyes were moist and clear, like a bright sky. He was trembling with nervousness, still carrying the emotional tone of the tears he had shed earlier. His mixed-race face looked as handsome as a prince straight out of a fairytale, worthy of a childhood sweetheart princess.
 

 
And speaking of princesses, is there anyone in this show more suited than Zhao Zai?
 

 
None of the guests noticed that Noah harbored such awkward and inexperienced affection for Zhao Zai. After all, the other two little kids were also very clingy to her, and Noah clearly didn’t understand the complexities of the situation. He thought his dad was cold toward others but kind to his mom, and he wanted to be kind to Zhao Zai too. He wanted her to be his bride.
 

 
“Ah?”
 

 
The little princess was puzzled.
 

 
Now that it was out in the open, Noah, with the air of someone who had nothing to lose, declared to all the adults with a royal confidence: “On the first day, you said you wanted a big plane and a big ship, and I’ll buy them for you in the future, if you become my bride!”
 

 
He said it with such bold, unrestrained confidence.
 

 
However, before his words even settled, Zhao Zai, who had been in a daze, was suddenly picked up by Jiang Dang:
 

 
“It’s time for your ballet lesson, little princess.”
 

 
Noah tilted his head back, and the first thing he saw was the man with a sharp nose and thin lips, who wore a distant, indifferent smile in his deep black eyes. When viewed from the side, his handsome profile resembled that of a cold, aloof fox. The arm he had around Zhao Zai was very conspicuous. Yet, when he turned to look at Zhao Zai, his expression softened into a pure, paternal smile, and Noah felt a surge of irritation.
 

 
[What the hell, I just discovered a love triangle on this variety show.]
 

 
[Especially now that I know Zhao Zai isn’t really a little kid… this is even more fun.]
 

 
[To those of you who’ve been hooked by this, come join me in shipping the Dang-Zhao couple. Check out the Bilibili video “How to Conquer Me” for more.]
 

 
It was all in good fun and light teasing.
 

 
It's considered unethical to pair children together for shipping. That’s a sacred space that shouldn’t be tainted by profit. The production team of ‘Baby Chaos’ didn’t intentionally try to create a couple, but it can only be said that Zhao Zai is too lovable, a little sunbeam that cures arrogance. The simple, innocent feelings Noah expressed towards her, like wanting to be with her every day, hold her hand, and be her best friend, are pure and straightforward.
 

 
What kind of feeling is this? No one could categorize it.
 

 
It was more like the innocent fondness and admiration that one little cub might have for another.
 

 
Since Noah said it was love, then perhaps it was!
 

 
Time would tell, anyway.
 

 
The show ended with a group photo of all the participants before they left the park.
 

 
---
 

 
When Zhao Zai woke up, she immediately rolled down from her main personality's position.
 

 
And she really rolled.
 

 
She was still very young, and among the many personalities, she was one of the more incomplete and fragile ones. After finishing the entire variety show, she was so tired that she almost collapsed. She was swiftly scooped up by the sharp-eyed, quick-handed Consort Chen, who instructed Han Zhi to carry her back to the room to rest.
 

 
Han Zhi: "Zhao Zai hasn't woken up yet."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Let her rest for a while. I'll take over."
 

 
Consort Chen was the most glamorous and star-like personality among them.
 

 
She was used to being adored by the public. In the past, anyone who saw her had to kneel and call her "Consort." Even the most noble, like the emperor, would privately wash her feet for her. Sometimes, when attending large events, if Tong Zhao decided to be lazy and didn’t show up, she would send her substitute.
 

 
Master Lu didn’t think much of it: "Let her take the throne for an hour, and the matchmaker will have to work overtime for a month."
 

 
"Learn some new words and use them. I, your aunt, am very noble, and ordinary men aren't worthy."
 

 
Consort Chen was a little upset by her sarcastic remarks. After sitting in the main personality’s position, she wore a face of displeasure.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a separate filming room.
 

 
The room had a clean bathroom and a makeup table, so the celebrities could freshen up before meeting people.
 

 
Consort Chen sat in front of the makeup table, touching up her makeup.
 

 
At this time, a staff member came in with hot tea: "Because the modeling is special, Sister Xiao Zhao is the last to wake up. The other guests have already rested for a day. Would you like to watch the raw footage? I can play it now."
 

 
Some guests care a lot about their performance on the show, but since the memories from the holographic shoot hadn’t fully come back yet, they could only review the raw footage to reflect on it. For guests like Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, there were staff members who would specially check on them after they woke up.
 

 
No need to send an assistant to ask—raw footage would be delivered directly to them.
 

 
"No need, thank you."
 

 
Consort Chen focused on retouching her makeup in the mirror.
 

 
For her, it seemed that making herself more beautiful was the most important thing in the world. She didn’t care about how her "self" had performed on the show. Of course, this didn’t mean she didn’t love her "self," it was just... which personality would mess things up? That was impossible, so she didn’t worry about it at all.
 

 
She’d rather think about what color eyeshadow to use.
 

 
Consort Chen liked vibrant, bright colors. After Master Lu criticized her, it made the Consort unhappy. Now, her makeup tone leaned towards a more aggressive style, and she picked the brightest lipstick from her makeup bag. The staff member beside her secretly admired her—if it weren’t for her stunning beauty, who could pull off such a bold color in everyday life?
 

 
True, a female star's "everyday" life couldn’t even really be called "everyday."
 

 
Because she had just woken up from the holographic shoot, her face was slightly pale. Her soft lips were painted with bright red lipstick, and her cool, fair skin made her look like a beautiful woman stepping out of a dark, mystical painting. Her long hair fell beside her face, embodying the classic beauty of black hair, white skin, and red lips.
 

 
The staff member had been watching the filming of the show the entire time.
 

 
She couldn’t help but reflect in her heart—who could have imagined that such an angelic little girl like Tong Zhao would grow up to become such a powerful, elegant beauty?
 

 
When Tong Zhao had just said "thank you" to her, she honestly couldn’t feel the gratitude in those words.
 

 
It was as if it was only natural for others to serve her, to be kind to her.
 

 
What was even more puzzling was that when the staff member realized she was being treated this way... she wasn’t even upset? She wasn’t arrogant, just... everything felt natural.
 

 
The staff member stopped thinking about it.
 

 
After all, delivering footage and water to the guests was part of her job.
 

 
Next to "Tong Zhao," the staff member instinctively held her breath.
 

 
The filming room was silent.
 

 
At that moment, the sound of running footsteps in the hallway broke the silence, followed by the staff member's helpless shout: “Noah, wait, don’t run around! Although Tong Zhao has woken up, she might not have rested well…”
 

 
"I’ll be good and quiet, and I’ll stay with her while she rests!"
 

 
Noah's childish voice could be heard from far away.
 

 
You couldn’t hide a child's voice. The tone was full of eagerness, and also a bit of panic.
 

 
When Noah thought of the three friends he had made on the show, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia had already met up, but Tong Zhao had been nowhere to be found. The staff member said she had woken up the latest and they would have to wait for her. If she woke up, they would let him know…
 

 
No one knew how to explain this to the child.
 

 
Since Noah was mixed-race, apart from filming this show, he had been flying around the world with his parents, rarely engaging with Chinese films, and couldn’t even read all the Chinese characters. Tong Zhao may have been popular, but she hadn’t reached the level of fame in Hollywood.
 

 
So, Noah, who was in the dark, couldn’t wait any longer.
 

 
He believed that Tong Zhao would definitely understand him. He would stay quietly by her side and not cause any trouble. Once he saw her, he would apologize properly and tell her he couldn’t wait to see her.
 

 
The common trait between children and adults is that, when they like someone, they rush toward them.
 

 
No need to hide it, no need to learn it.
 

 
The filming room door was half-open, and Noah knew that the little princess was sleeping behind it. He barged in—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, I’m here!”
 

 
……
 

 
……
 

 
“Huh?”
 

 
A long time later, Noah still couldn’t forget that lazy, melodious voice.
 

 
It was different from the little princess he remembered.
 

 
But he could vaguely see the same person in her features.
 

 
The woman in front of him clearly looked like someone who had fully matured, her tone lazy, her eyes glancing at him with a detached, indifferent look.
 

 
"Did you call me?"
 

 
"I... I’m looking for Tong Zhao."
 

 
He said it softly, his tone weakening.
 

 
Noah was usually quite bold with adults.
 

 
But in front of this woman, he couldn’t muster his usual bravado.
 

 
The Consort was an exceptional beauty among women, but Noah hadn’t yet matured enough to understand her allure or be tempted by her. He simply felt that she exuded a terrifying, unapproachable aura, almost like the snake spirit in ‘Calabash Brothers’ or the evil queen in ‘Snow White’...
 

 
"I am Tong Zhao."
 

 
Noah was afraid of her, and the Consort didn’t particularly like children either.
 

 
Moreover, just before, Master Lu had teased her, saying she always attracted troublesome admirers. She was in a bad mood, and this time, she just wanted to dress up nicely, with no interest in anyone. She had even less patience for coaxing a little brat like Noah. "Is there something you need?"
 

 
"I... I... you... you..."
 

 
Noah lost his words.
 

 
At that moment, a staff member who had caught up squatted down to explain to little Noah about Tong Zhao's situation.
 

 
Noah wasn’t dumb. When he finally understood that his innocent first love, his little bride, was actually a big sister...
 

 
He stood frozen in place.
 

 
His mindset crumbled like the Niagara Falls—completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Who am I? Where am I?
 

 
Who is she?
 

 
The little princess in his memory had a soft, fair face and cute lips. She would gently call him Noah, care for him, be especially kind to him, and tolerate his stubborn, bad temper. After recovering his memories, Noah had resolved to change his attitude. In the past, he didn’t care if others disliked him, but now, he didn’t want to be disliked by Zhao Zai.
 

 
"Is this the kid from the show? I haven’t recovered my memory, so I don’t remember who you are,"
 

 
The big sister’s bright red lips curved into a distant, polite smile. Her face was still incredibly beautiful, but it was nothing like Noah’s familiar image of her.
 

 
"If there’s nothing special, then forget about me."
 

 
This conversation felt like a kingfisher releasing a fish back into the water.
 

 
Having experienced the cruelty and unfairness of love at an early age, Noah didn’t cry out loud. He was just very confused:
 

 
"Will Zhao Zai become like you when she grows up?"
 

 
Noticing the disdain and disappointment in the little boy's words, the Consort raised an eyebrow and scoffed, "Probably. If there’s something you want to say to her, it’s the same if you say it to me. I can simulate her answer for you."
 

 
After all, the personalities knew each other very well.
 

 
Noah stood there in a daze, continuing to doubt his life:
 

 
"I originally wanted to ask if you could be my bride when you grow up..."
 

 
Oh, so it turns out you’re a subject under my skirt.
 

 
Although he had no memory of the person in front of him, Noah was still a very handsome boy. His appearance revealed many admirable qualities, making him a potential suitor—someone who could be considered a decent prospect, which made the Empress Dowager take a second glance at Zhao Zai. In her memory, she had never been involved in "puppy love," but she had always had male classmates who liked her.
 

 
Attracting men’s affection—just as expected of her.
 

 
Consort Chen mentally gave herself a thumbs-up.
 

 
Her lips finally curled into a more sincere smile as she repeated her earlier words:
 

 
"Forget about me."
 

 
After speaking, Consort Chen gently cupped the boy’s stunned face with her delicate hands and kissed his forehead. She then turned away, casually checking her WeChat messages on her phone, her body language making it clear that she would not give this little boy any more hope.
 

 
Noah lifted his hand to cover his forehead.
 

 
There was a faint trace of a lingering red mark.
 

 
He stared at the Consort Chen in disbelief—
 

 
Bad! Woman!
 

 
Noah arrived full of excitement, only to leave with doubts about life.
 

 
Meanwhile, Consort Chen casually flipped through her WeChat messages.
 

 
As she saw it, there were only three men who might have a chance with "herself." Shi Qianqiu had some sparks with her, but it seemed he wasn’t interested in taking it further and preferred to keep the relationship as a good director-actor bond... Consort Chen could understand him—after all, for him, a girlfriend was easy to find, but a beloved lead actress was rare.
 

 
What if the relationship soured after getting involved?
 

 
Plus, it wasn’t like she couldn’t live without him.
 

 
This mature and effortless way of handling things greatly impressed Shi Qianqiu in Consort Chen's mind. The more difficult a man was to handle, the more interesting he seemed. However, Zhao Zhao might not agree with that.
 

 
As for Wei Zekai...
 

 
When she opened his chat, the corners of Consort Chen's lips twitched in a rather ungraceful manner.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You were so cute when you were little.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [That little brat is kind of annoying.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Damn, I can tell he's not sincere! Don’t get involved in early love!]
 

 
...
 

 
The kids knew more about fighting for what they wanted than he did.
 

 
After reading Wei Zekai’s usual ramblings, Consort Chen had an urge to call Noah back. If he was willing to start striving from now on, aiming to become a world leader or the President of the United States, she might be willing to consider it.
 

 
After a brief pause, Consort Chen typed: [What about you? Are you sincere with me?]
 

 
Not long after the message was sent, Zhao Zhao woke up.
 

 
Seeing her having fun, Zhao Zhao didn’t rush to reclaim her seat. She was still a little groggy from sleep, and since the memories of the other personalities hadn’t flooded back yet, she didn’t know what Consort Chen had been up to behind her back. So, she suspiciously asked: [What happened while I was gone…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [How could I tarnish someone's reputation without reason? Not only did I avoid causing any trouble, but I also helped you fend off the bad suitors!]
 

 
【Bad suitors?】
 

 
[Hmm…] Consort Chen thought for a moment. [Maybe I should say, the bad seeds.]
 

 
Zhao Zhao still believed her.
 

 
After all, while Consort Chen was popular with men, she was also very good at rejecting them.
 

 
After saying that, Consort Chen returned the main personality's position to her.
 

 
Before Zhao Zhao could recall her manipulative actions, Consort Chen swiftly ran off and closed the door.
 

 
Once the door was closed, Consort Chen no longer cared for anyone.
 

 
Zhao Zhao blinked, and in the mirror, she saw her makeup looking even more cold and glamorous than usual.
 

 
If not for the team’s request, she would have preferred a gentler, more elegant style.
 

 
Then, her phone vibrated.
 

 
Zhao Zhao looked down—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I... don’t know.]
 

 
What does he not know?
 

 
Zhao Zhao scrolled up and found the question Consort Chen had sent, and everything became clear.
 

 
As she was thinking about how to reply, Wei Zekai sent another message: [Can you give me some time to think?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [You still need to think?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I was going to say something simple, like 'brotherhood is stronger than gold, with unbreakable loyalty,' but before I sent it, I suddenly didn’t feel like saying that anymore. I don’t know why, let me think it over.]
 

 
He sent a meme of a little cat in a toilet, with the caption: [I can’t figure it out.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You’re awake? Once you’re rested, let’s have a team-building day. We miss you!]
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Zhao Zhao's lips curved slightly.
 

 
Xiao Kai had always been slow in matters of love, and Zhao Zhao felt she was also a person full of uncertainty. She had gone through so much, and it seemed like she was a bundle of contradictions... She simply didn’t have the time to figure others out, only wanting to understand herself first.
 

 
To her surprise, part of her memory from the variety show had already been restored.
 

 
Zhao Zhao felt that her mental strength had grown again, which is why she recovered faster than others.
 

 
In the variety show, Zhao Zhao remembered someone had praised her for having a strong sense of purpose, never giving others the chance to pity her. But she couldn’t remember who that person was.
 

 
Now, she remembered.
 

 
It was after she completed a quick-transmigration task, when the system gave her the task evaluation.
 

 
What was that task again?
 

 
As Zhao Zhao pondered deeper, a door deep within her memory palace slowly creaked open.
 

 
It was a door covered in yellow high-risk seals and iron chains.
# Chapter126
System: [Warning!] [Warning!]
 

 
[Host, please promptly unlock this personality in a space with high privacy and security!]
 

 
It had been years since Zhao Zhao last heard a system prompt, and she actually felt a bit nostalgic. Before, whenever her missions were almost completed, she would often receive warnings from the system. Zhao Zhao had a high level of trust in the system, so without questioning it, she politely declined the program's invitation to stay for a celebratory meal, using the excuse of not feeling well. She took the nanny van and quickly returned.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao locked herself in her room, the lock on the deepest door had already been knocked off.
 

 
The consciousness palace was eerily quiet.
 

 
In the grand hall, Lu Xianchang stayed with her, while everyone else returned to their rooms.
 

 
In Zhao Zhao's quick-transmigration journey, only Lu Xianchang was from a fantasy world, one with high magic and martial arts. Even though they had arrived in an era with thin spiritual energy, Lu Xianchang still managed to use effective methods to cultivate. It was unlikely that she could embark on the immortal path again, as the conditions of spiritual energy weren’t there, but she was definitely superior to ordinary people in many ways.
 

 
So, had she been to other high-magic worlds in her numerous instances?
 

 
Zhao Zhao couldn’t remember.
 

 
Perhaps within those various doors, there were also personalities with special abilities.
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [Do you not remember who is behind this door?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [I don't remember.] She gave a bitter smile. [Zhao Zai, because she is a part of my childhood self, I clearly remember her, which is why I was able to think of her before I opened the door. I can only feel that this personality is a bit dangerous.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [More dangerous than Duan Ge?]
 

 
Duan Ge, having lived through a blood-soaked apocalyptic world, often harbored a desire for violence and a tendency for bloodshed, even when she returned to a peaceful era. This could hardly be blamed on her; in those times, even a moment of mercy could mean death for herself and the young companions she led. For instance, when she participated in ‘One Life Survivor’, Duan Ge killed twenty people in a holographic world, which allowed her to release her violent and brutal rage. In the real world, those twenty people were unharmed, and the entire program, including her, gained both fame and fortune.
 

 
This was why Zhao Zhao felt she needed to keep performing, to help the various personalities find a balance between the illusory and the real.
 

 
Zhao Zhao considered for a moment: [...Probably.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang reassured her: [It’s fine. No matter how dangerous a person is, there's no reason to harm oneself.]
 

 
All the personalities loved Zhao Zhao.
 

 
Asking the other personalities to return to their rooms wasn’t out of fear of death. After all, they were all in the same boat, so why fear anything? It was just that they didn’t want to trigger the new friend. Zhao Zhao was very protective of them.
 

 
Zhao Zhao cupped her face: [So, I just found a quiet place to wait for her to come out.]
 

 
This feeling was a bit strange, like waiting for a monster egg to hatch.
 

 
Before the eggshell cracked, no one knew what kind of monster would emerge.
 

 
While the two were chatting in a casual manner, the door lock fell, and a pale white hand appeared.
 

 
It was as if this white hand had been nurtured in countless, lightless deep chambers.
 

 
The young girl was dressed in a pure white silk saree, adorned with intricate gold and silver threads, both bright and dark, shimmering as she moved. However, her saree was more revealing than the traditional version, exposing her slender waist and thighs, barely covered.
 

 
She wore a lot of accessories: large, vivid red rubies, gold ornaments, and water diamonds. Her platinum blonde hair was styled into a Greek goddess braid at the back of her head, with perfectly round, lustrous pearls strung together in a chain and woven into the braid.
 

 
With so many accessories, none of them could outshine the girl's natural beauty.
 

 
The pearls paled in comparison to her milk-like skin.
 

 
The rubies dimmed before her lips.
 

 
Even supreme authority was nothing more than a long stick she kicked around, slightly uncomfortable to the touch.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao saw that face she had seen countless times in the mirror, yet slightly different now, she remembered her name.
 

 
"Iya, you're awake."
 

 
She blurted it out.
 

 
"I'm awake..."
 

 
The girl, called Iya, gave her a sweet smile, and her voice was filled with a complex, crazy joy:
 

 
"Will there be my followers here?"
 

 
＊
 

 
Along with the name came the vast memories from that world.
 

 
Even the reason why she had forgotten this personality entirely was remembered at the same time...
 

 
System: "Because you stayed in that world for too long, your previous mental capacity wasn't enough to hold the full version of 'Iya,' so it was temporarily sealed."
 

 
To put it bluntly, the previous configuration wasn't sufficient.
 

 
Forcing the application to run would have burned out the graphics card or overloaded the memory.
 

 
That was the first time Zhao Zhao traveled to a Western fantasy world.
 

 
In that world, it was common to have both gods of light and demon gods.
 

 
The God of Light represents the order of the entire continent. Believing in it grants the power of faith, and with this power, warriors and mages can combat the dark creatures. What kind of order is this? It's like no matter what job you have, if you want to protect the value of your money, you ultimately have to get involved with the investment industry.
 

 
The power of faith is like that.
 

 
You can have any elemental attribute—metal, wood, water, fire, or earth—but if you want to use it in actual combat against enemies from the abyss, you must believe in the God of Light. At the time, Zhao Zhao thought, if Sasuke from ‘Naruto’ came and wanted to perform a Fire Style jutsu, he would first have to pray to the God of Light, to infuse his chakra with the power of light... Ah, no, the power of light.
 

 
The identity that the system assigned to Zhao Zhao in this world was that of a saintess from a rural temple.
 

 
Strictly speaking, she was a saintess in reserve.
 

 
In the rural temple, there were dozens of other saintesses in reserve, and across the entire continent, there were over a hundred temples. Ultimately, only one person could truly become the saintess after passing numerous trials.
 

 
The saintess trial was like the imperial exams of the Western fantasy world.
 

 
But it wasn’t so public, more like an unspoken secret.
 

 
Zhao Zhao had long been accustomed to starting in difficult situations, where one wrong move could cost her life. So, she accepted this setting without resistance, hiding her sharp edges, and decided to follow the rules of this world.
 

 
At that time, the system only issued one task: to complete the current trial.
 

 
Zhao Zhao completed task after task, gradually learning how sinful this land, blessed by the God of Light, truly was. The saintess trial in the rural temple was simple: it required beauty, a good figure, and virginity, along with a written exam. Cultural knowledge couldn’t be too low, and the affinity with the God of Light had to be high.
 

 
Affinity with the God of Light referred to how firm one’s belief was.
 

 
Because the difficulty of this world was unusually high, the system granted Zhao Zhao administrator-level permissions—just as the system could consider the host’s endurance limits and seal parts of her memories, she, upon gaining this permission, could rewrite her own beliefs, deeply hypnotizing herself until she even began to believe her own lies.
 

 
The first line of code Zhao Zhao rewrote was her deep, unwavering belief in the God of Light.
 

 
Even if she performed actions that violated the teachings, she could genuinely justify them as acts of piety, and this would not affect her ability to gain the power of faith.
 

 
At the time, she simply wanted to make the task more convenient.
 

 
Otherwise, as a young person raised in a family with strong political ideals, she would never have been able to obtain the power of faith.
 

 
The trials at the town-level temple required learning magic, something Zhao Zhao had no problem with—she learned it very quickly.
 

 
After learning magic, the next step was to assist the instructor in killing dark creatures, which wasn’t difficult either.
 

 
Her repeated excellent performances made Zhao Zhao a key candidate for further development, and her efficiency in completing tasks was top-notch.
 

 
After passing the basic tests, the saintess would be presented with a snow-white magical blindfold by the local temple’s priest, which had delicate lace edges. From then on, she could only perceive the outside world through the lens of her faith in the God of Light.
 

 
That was a very special experience.
 

 
Many young saintesses fell and got injured while walking, but Zhao Zhao adapted well. After all, one reason was that she "deeply trusted" the guidance of the God of Light, and the other reason was, wasn’t this basically an infrared thermal scanner?
 

 
The saintess tasks assigned to her were unexpectedly simple, resembling beginner quests in an online game. Accompanying the instructor to hunt dark creatures was thrilling, but most of the time, she just accompanied vehicles transporting goods. The containers were covered with cloth, and occasionally, eerie, rasping sounds could be heard from inside.
 

 
The instructor said they were dark creatures.
 

 
The appearance of dark creatures would be distorted when sensed, and the saintess would only feel how hideous they were.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao rode in a carriage to a larger temple, the trials she faced became even stranger.
 

 
Main Quest 3: Temple Trial – Cleanse the Bodies of Dark Creatures
 

 
Dark creatures also had magic cores, which, when refined, could be turned into magical potions, useful in many ways. However, before refinement, they needed to be purified, and having the saintess cleanse their corrupt bodies was one of the essential processes.
 

 
Main Quest 4: Temple Trial – Teach the New Saintesses
 

 
The saintess candidates all came from orphaned girls across the continent.
 

 
At the time, the identity Zhao Zhao took on, aside from her beauty and relatively high magical talent, was that of someone who could barely afford a meal. If not for the temple taking her in, the legal protections for orphans and widows were very limited, and surviving outside was a major issue.
 

 
Those young saintesses were in the same situation Zhao Zhao had been in before.
 

 
To eat well, sleep well, and be protected, they could only do their best to complete the trials.
 

 
With the blindfold on, Zhao Zhao only knew their height and weight, unable to see the contours of their faces. Among the first group of girls she was in charge of, there was a younger sister who loved to sing, and she liked to touch Zhao Zhao's blindfold, which made her eyelids itch. Guna enjoyed humming her own tunes, and perhaps because of her creativity and imagination, she was a bit difficult to manage.
 

 
Everyone firmly believed in the God of Light and the temple. To carry out her tasks, Zhao Zhao also followed suit and brainwashed herself, but part of her still thought like a modern person. She felt something was wrong, though her “doubt” was modified through code and beautified into—
 

 
She suspected that the temple was not truly faithful to the God of Light, nor was it fully practicing the teachings of the God of Light.
 

 
Zhao Zhao began to collect evidence.
 

 
One of the pieces of evidence that confirmed her suspicion was when the system issued a side mission the moment she began to have doubts.
 

 
Side Quest 1: Strange Sounds in the Priest's Room
 

 
Quest Description: The priest of the Jiadoluo Temple trusts you greatly and often assigns you trivial paperwork. You have the privilege and honor of moving freely around the temple. Today, due to your curiosity, you secretly pocketed some documents to carry with you so that, even if you were discovered while searching the temple at midnight, you would have a good excuse to explain—simply that you were trying to return the documents to the priest! With this in mind, you overheard strange sounds outside the priest's room, similar to the eerie noises heard from the cargo containers carrying dark creatures.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Quest Description: In the class you teach, there are five little girls. Four of them passed the trial, while one was eliminated for misbehaving. No one cares about what happened to the failed girl. You try asking Sister Cheng in the temple, and she tells you that the unqualified girls will return to their original places and will no longer be under the guidance of the God of Light. The other successful saintesses are afraid of returning to a life of hunger and cold, so they have become more eager to study.
 

 
Because of your favored status, your room is stocked with plenty of dry food and snacks. Even though the temple can't keep the singing girl, you want to give her some supplies before she is kicked out, to help her survive until she can find a job in the town.
 

 
You couldn’t find her.
 

 
No one talks about the eliminated saintess Guna anymore, and the system didn’t punish you for failing to complete the side quest. The quest is still marked as "In Progress." You guess that this means she’s still alive after being kicked out of the temple; otherwise, the quest would have been marked as "Failed" due to the girl’s death.
 

 
Perhaps this is the best news, you think optimistically.
 

 
---
 

 
The annual Festival of Light is approaching.
 

 
This year is especially different.
 

 
The previous saintess died as a martyr in battle against the dark creatures, so this year, during the Festival of Light, the Pope will select a true saintess, who will be worshipped by all the people. The chosen saintess will reside in the Holy Temple of Light in the imperial capital and will have the privilege of meeting the emperor without kneeling.
 

 
Since only the followers of the God of Light can fight the dark creatures, the empire's royal power is completely subordinated to the church’s authority.
 

 
If the king is not devout enough, or if something displeases the Pope, the defense of the empire will be in jeopardy.
 

 
During the Festival of Light, the Pope will symbolically kill a dark creature.
 

 
This dark creature, used for show, will have already been "prepared" before the event, weakened to the point of near death to ensure there are no casualties.
 

 
Zhao Zhao is the highly anticipated seed candidate.
 

 
And she also felt that once she took the saintess throne and got close to the core of the church’s power, all her doubts would be resolved.
 

 
Main Quest 5: The Eve of the Festival of Light
 

 
You are assigned to cleanse the sacrificial offering.
 

 
The dark creatures have their own unique language, which sounds like meaningless raspy growls to humans. Their physical composition is also very strange. By touch, you sense a body similar to that of a medium-sized dog, bird-like wings, and four legs covered in cold, wet scales.
 

 
There is also a flat face, with pits and depressions.
 

 
When cleaning the captured dark creatures in the past, they were always very noisy, but this one is unusually quiet. It had been roaring angrily, but when you entered the prison cell, it fell silent. You are somewhat surprised, but also relieved that today’s task will be simpler.
 

 
Until, while you are cleaning its body, you hear its hoarse, subdued cries form a familiar melody.
 

 
Its voice is broken, like a shattered wind instrument, and at first, it sounds like the desperate crying of a child.
 

 
Can dark creatures sing?
 

 
You are astonished.
 

 
Then, you stop scrubbing the dark creature’s body.
 

 
Because you suddenly remember something.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Completed
 

 
"You found Guna."

[The moment I see you, my head hurts.]
 

 
Tong Zhao pressed her head, as a flood of memories poured into her brain, causing a splitting headache.
 

 
When Iya sat down, a human-shaped chair suddenly appeared in the consciousness palace. It was made by four heretics who had harmed innocent girls for their own selfish desires. Even as she sat, she could still see faces filled with pain and regret beneath her: "Take your time to recall, I'm not in a hurry."
 

 
The Dark God, the dark creatures, and the Saintess trials were all a scam created by the church to consolidate its divine power.
 

 
The Dark God had long since left this continent, having been defeated by the Light God.
 

 
However, the reason the church could stand on equal footing with the king and even hold the upper hand was because they fought the Dark God every year... Without the Dark God, the temple would just be a place where people went to pray on Sundays. At that time, the Pope was unwilling to accept this outcome, so he used powerful magic to create the illusion that the Dark God had not left.
 

 
The temple did not need so many Saintesses.
 

 
But the temple needed many, many dark creatures.
 

 
The dark creatures were created using girls with magical talent through the church’s unique synthesis array, no different from when the Dark God was still around, except that they were now artificially made.
 

 
A carefully selected Saintess stands above countless bones. Even though some of the previous Saintesses, who enjoyed the benefits of power, learned the truth, they either collapsed because they had unknowingly aided the evil during their trials or rationalized their actions.
 

 
More than that, they believed in the church wholeheartedly.
 

 
There have been many generations of Saintess trials.
 

 
When Tong Zhao crossed over, it had clearly become something like ‘The Hunger Games’. Not only did it serve as a provider of raw materials for dark creatures, but it also became a grand gamble for some nobles and high-ranking clergy. They would place their bets on a particular Saintess, and if she passed all the trials and ultimately became the true Saintess, the person who placed the bet would gain her virginity.
 

 
Was all of this just for the virginity?
 

 
It was all about the pleasure of desecrating the Saintess.
 

 
The identity of Iya that Tong Zhao crossed into was one of those bets placed by powerful figures.
 

 
Because of Tong Zhao’s extraordinary faith, the church always considered her a deeply brainwashed fool. They trusted her completely and even gave her many opportunities to investigate the truth. As she unraveled the layers of deceit, she witnessed even darker, more brutal and inhumane truths…
 

 
As a female reporter, it takes a great deal of courage to face the darkness of human nature.
 

 
In her previous world, the reporter Shuyi had fallen into depression.
 

 
But in this Western fantasy world, Iya not only observed all of this, but she also discovered that those seemingly simple and ordinary tasks were actually unintentionally helping to perpetuate such atrocities. She was a cog in the entire system of sin. Every Saintess who passed the trials was a sinner.
 

 
The peace and warmth after crossing over were all an illusion.
 

 
The kinder the person, the less they could bear the darkness.
 

 
Iya was so angry that she almost lost control. Her nails dug deeply into her palm. When Guna, who noticed something was wrong, affectionately rubbed her eye mask against her as she usually did in class, the berserk magic shattered part of Iya’s eye structure. Blood poured from her eye sockets, like tears of blood.
 

 
It was her fault.
 

 
She was guilty.
 

 
Iya felt it was her responsibility to eradicate all this evil, even if this idea seemed as insignificant to the authorities as a mayfly shaking a great tree.
 

 
At the same time, the system unlocked the final mission for her in this world.
 

 
"Become the Last Saintess"
 

 
The system’s original intention was for Iya to gather evidence, expose the truth, and overthrow the church.
 

 
Iya felt that wasn’t enough.
 

 
Wasn’t the church in desperate need of dark creatures?
 

 
A fake wouldn’t do. It had to be real.
 

 
Inside her consciousness palace, Tong Zhao reminded her:
 
"We have children here, so let’s not bring out such a restricted chair."
 

 
"So troublesome."
 

 
Iya sighed softly.
 

 
The next moment, the human-shaped chair was covered in a layer of black leather, but the outlines of limbs occasionally pushing out from beneath the leather still caused one's sanity to drop.
 

 
"Not only has the Dark God left, but the Light God also gave up on its followers long ago."
 

 
"It’s all a deception the church wove together to maintain its power."
 

 
"Later, I found the legacy of the Dark God before it left."
 

 
Iya spoke as though it were a mere detail.
 

 
In reality, she had to race against time before the coming Light Festival, finding a way to break the deadlock. Half of her belief came from the fact that the system never provided a dead end, and the other half came from overwhelming anger and malice. She didn’t even consider herself to be delivering justice; she just wanted to kill all these sinful heretics, to return the atrocities they committed against the little Saintesses back to them tenfold.
 

 
"I really didn’t do much."
 

 
I just stirred up internal strife within the church, triggered two purges of the old church with the Truth Wars, and ultimately, by gathering the faith power from across the continent, became a new deity.
 

 
During the most crucial period, Iya used her delicate demeanor to deceive the church, and this habit became ingrained in her bones. After becoming the only and last Saintess, the continent was unified and brought peace.
 

 
To punish herself, Saintess Iya’s temple was not luxurious. It was said that there were no holy servants attending her; apart from the Saintess living there, the temple was just a dilapidated and crumbling building. Travelers who accidentally entered the temple said that the absence of holy servants was a lie. They met a weak and timid blind girl, who, despite her fragility, provided them with food to stave off hunger and a place to rest.
 

 
He wanted to meet the Saintess.
 

 
But just mentioning her name made the servant girl tremble with fear.
 

 
It seems the Saintess was indeed as brutal and powerful as the rumors suggested!
 

 
Iya had stayed in the western fantasy world for so long that she almost forgot she was only there for a mission. She didn’t like the system, and she didn’t really like herself either. To this day, she couldn’t forgive herself for noticing so late...
 

 
She knew that even if she had realized earlier, she might not have been able to make a change quickly.
 

 
With the legacy of the Dark God, her divine power grew stronger, but so did the impulse to commit evil. After maintaining a century of peace on the continent, she chose to end her life and left that plane.
 

 
Iya also inherited Tong Zhao's memories from that time.
 

 
She furrowed her brows in distress: "I’m afraid I can’t be of any help."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I suggest you be honest with yourself."
 

 
"Alright," she replied.
 

 
Iya propped up her long, slender, and beautiful legs, and with one foot, she stomped down on one of the restless chair components, silencing its movements. Her tone was lazy:
 

 
"Why should I help you? The world is better off destroyed. Just lock me up again."
 

 
"Once you're released, there's no locking you back in. Your destructive desires will affect me, including the mental imprint left on my soul from the Dark God's legacy. You must commit evil at certain times each year; you must harm living beings."
 

 
Iya said nothing.
 

 
At that time, her solution was to harm the worst of the evil-doers. When the old heretics had been mostly purged, there was no one left to kill in order to complete her mission.
 

 
So, what was she supposed to do?
 

 
Where should all that overwhelming malice go?
 

 
The powerful and violent Saintess chose to point the sword at herself, to torture herself in order to atone.
 

 
This was the only self-destructive aspect of Tong Zhao’s personality.
 

 
"I can take on some villain roles for you, so you don't have to hurt yourself anymore," Tong Zhao said. "It's not the same world anymore."
 

 
"I know."
 

 
The lace blindfold covered Iya’s eyes, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see her expression.
 

 
But their feelings were impossible to hide from each other.
 

 
They were silent for a long time.
 

 
Iya slightly curled her pale lips, bringing up everything that both personalities knew, but had never spoken aloud:
 

 
"Are you trying to convince me to forgive myself? Haven’t you always blamed yourself for not realizing that Xu Zhu and her mother were a pair of scum, always thinking it was your fault your mother died? That’s why, in every world you’ve traveled through, you’ve tried so hard not to make mistakes. The person who’s most cruel to you is yourself, the one who draws the line with others is you."
 

 
For those without boundaries, forgiving oneself is a simple matter.
 

 
Even if they commit murder, arson, or force others into prostitution, they have their own logic to absolve themselves.
 

 
But for pure, gentle people…
 

 
Overcoming oneself is, in fact, the hardest challenge.
 

 
The moment for self-reflection always comes without warning, and suddenly "yourself" exposes all your secrets. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.
 

 
Despite the embarrassment, there was also a sense of relief.
 

 
"You're right,"
 

 
Tong Zhao looked directly at her, recalling every version of herself in each world, the faces that were similar yet slightly different, the varying thoughts and personalities: "So, I'm slowly remembering every version of myself from each world, trying to forgive myself."
 

 
Iya turned her face away.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked over and wrapped her arms around her, and Iya didn’t push her away.
 

 
"I have to admit, one of the reasons I’m letting you out now is because I was previously afraid to face the mistakes I’ve made."
 

 
The Saintess didn’t hold back: "Little useless thing."
 

 
"Saintess, hug the little useless thing."
 

 
Iya snorted coldly and pressed her into her embrace:
 

 
"I need to occasionally commit evil in the holographic footage. Don’t try to cling to me for no reason."
# Chapter127
After the edited version of "Baby Chaos" aired, it sparked a wave on Weibo.
 

 
What kind of wave?
 

 
Fans imagined what their favorite idols would be like as a child on a variety show, and celebrities flooded the platform posting their childhood photos, blatantly riding on the coattails of the hype. However, the attention they brought ended up reflecting back on the "Baby Chaos" show itself, expanding the reach of the show. In the end, more people ended up benefiting from the increased attention.
 

 
Among those benefiting the most were Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang.
 

 
Although Jiang Dang telling ghost stories to kids sparked some controversy, many people were surprised by his attention to detail in caring for the tired little Zhao Zai. It turned out that he had some surprisingly humanistic qualities—there were even some netizens who took the opposite view, saying, "You guys are exaggerating and demonizing this male singer! He’s just a bit quirky, how is he a psychopath?"
 

 
Whether Jiang Dang was a normal person or mentally unstable was the subject of much debate.
 

 
The entertainment industry is a dream-making business, and questioning the authenticity of dreams is as futile as boiling a crane or burning a zither.
 

 
After the variety show filming ended, Jiang Dang threw himself into preparations for his national tour concert.
 

 
The first stop of the presale sold out in an unprecedented frenzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao wished him well through WeChat, but due to her work commitments, it was unlikely that she would attend his concert.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "You’re rejecting me, I know."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Can I sing one more song for you?"
 

 
Many people, including Jiang Dang’s assistants, thought he was acting a bit abnormal.
 

 
But in Tong Zhao’s eyes, Jiang Dang just retained the sharpness of a child towards the world—impulsive, spontaneous, with an artistic and epic kind of carefree attitude. Even his sadness was poetic. After a brief pause, he added: "Actually, I meant to ask: Can I sing one more song for you? I might sing for quite a while, so you can do other things while keeping the speaker on."
 

 
Jiang Dang's concert sold out like crazy, and tickets became hard to get.
 

 
It wasn't just his female fans; many people were drawn in because some of his songs were incredibly popular, so much so that no one could resist humming along to them. Many people who went to the concert filmed it and posted it on Douyin, and inviting someone along to watch was also a good choice.
 

 
A lot of people wanted to hear him sing, and often on his Weibo posts, there would be requests for him to cover certain songs.
 

 
Jiang Dang, depending on his mood, would sometimes fulfill his fans' wishes.
 

 
And at this moment, he hoped that someone would be willing to listen to him sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao directly called him.
 

 
As expected, Jiang Dang sang for a long time. She sat on the newly installed swing chair at home, gently rocking as she listened to him play and sing love songs, as if it were a private concert just for her. By the time she began to feel a little drowsy, he stopped: "It's getting late, you should go to bed."
 

 
"Mm."
 

 
"Goodnight."
 

 
Tong Zhao, a bit sleepy, took off her over-ear headphones and shifted from the swing chair to lie on the bed, her mind wandering off with all sorts of disconnected thoughts. She was wondering: What exactly is Jiang Dang's emotional intelligence like? At certain moments, he always seemed to intuitively understand what the other person truly needed, knowing which things didn't need to be asked or said, and when it was time to end things.
 

 
Jiang Dang never asked why she rejected him.
 

 
He didn’t even want to improve himself after knowing the reason, just like falling in love with a drifting cloud—trying to touch it was one thing, but missing it was regrettable, yet not something worth obsessing over.
 

 
Even if she said nothing, he knew exactly when she started to feel sleepy.
 

 
After getting under the covers, Tong Zhao reached up and touched her ear.
 

 
Every time Tong Zhao listened to Jiang Dang sing or speak, her ears always felt like they had just had a massage, becoming unusually sensitive.
 

 
Consort Chen: "You must have some feelings for him, right?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "To be honest, it's hard not to feel something."
 

 
There's a reason why he became a big star. Jiang Dang has a particularly strong personal charm, like a whirlpool. Being around him makes her forget all the worldly troubles, and he always manages to surprise her in strange ways.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "If I weren't a celebrity, or if I were a bit more carefree, having a relationship with him might have been an unforgettable, beautiful experience."
 

 
After all, they’re both in the same industry. Their schedules are packed, and neither of them can make time for the other. Falling into a sticky romance would only be a mutual torment.
 

 
Of course, the fact that she could come up with so many reasons to reject him simply meant she didn't like him enough.
 

 
All the personalities respect Tong Zhao's choices; what she likes is what they all love.
 

 
Iya: "This has nothing to do with me."
 

 
Senior Lu: "Hmm."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Then add one more upstairs."
 

 
Tong Zhao wiped her face and quickly pushed this little life incident out of her mind.
 

 
For many people, love is a very important matter. Tong Zhao had no intention of criticizing "love-brains" because, after all, everyone has something they love. As long as it's not evil or harmful, how could there be any distinction in the value of what people love?
 

 
Jiang Dang was like a brilliant, enchanting aurora that passed through her life.
 

 
And she had no intention of holding on to that light.
 

 
In Jiang Dang's heart, she was the same kind of existence.
 

 
---
 

 
(Note: The term "love-brain" refers to someone whose thoughts and actions are overly focused on love, often to the detriment of other aspects of life.)
 

 
After all, she herself had many things she couldn't figure out, and she had to take it slow.
 

 
Aside from her entanglement with love, Zeshan's team, led by Tong Zhao over the past six months, had already developed into a mature company. While its size still couldn't compare to the family businesses of their parents' generation, it had become a force not to be underestimated. The legend of the "golden touch" continued to grow.
 

 
Even with a venture capital company, making money isn’t just about picking the right projects and waiting for the returns.
 

 
Choosing projects, negotiating details, periodically overseeing them, reviewing reports, adjusting strategies...
 

 
These details were all things Tong Zhao couldn’t control individually, nor did she have the time to.
 

 
She could only teach her team, and then let them lead the company. Zeshan’s path to success, and its growing success, was closely tied to Wei Zekai’s involvement. His investment sense might still need work, but he had a talent for managing and handling details. As long as Tong Zhao gave him some direction, he could make several times the return.
 

 
Isn’t this life fulfilling?
 

 
Tong Zhao was very satisfied.
 

 
After resting for more than half a month, she finally announced her collaboration with Shi Qianqiu, to the eager anticipation of many directors and producers.
 

 
As for the industry's reaction, there were people who were annoyed by Shi Qianqiu and others who were annoyed by Tong Zhao. While cursing and grumbling, they also kept an ear out for their movements and updates, afraid of crossing paths. If the two were working on the same subject matter, forget it—either they’d have to release earlier or later.
 

 
Delaying was a good option.
 

 
While releasing a similar project at the same time wasn’t ideal, if there was a blockbuster of the same genre released earlier, the one that followed could still ride the wave of excitement when it ended.
 

 
The netizens’ opinions were more direct and simple—
 

 
[I'm crying. As a fan of the "Dang Zhao" CP, after the airing of ‘Baby Chaos’, there's no more sugar for me, but now Shi Zhao has an after-show??]
 

 
[They’re true love, I’m sold.]
 

 
[Wasn't Tong Zhao nearly invisible in the media recently? Did they secretly go on a date?]
 

 
The discussion became very heated.
 

 
During her break, the only people Tong Zhao hung out with were the second-generation heirs. Their outings were all private, membership-only, and paparazzi couldn’t catch her. Even if they managed to snap a picture of her chauffeur-driven car, that was as good as seeing her in person. However, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as a completely secret wall. Some netizens managed to release two photos of Tong Zhao shopping with another young woman. Someone commented, “What kind of family do you have to be from to be able to be a sister with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
It was later uncovered that the girl was the daughter of a coal magnate, and she was also a member of Zeshan.
 

 
These two photos proved that Tong Zhao was in China during her break.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He was easy to find. He didn’t treat himself like a celebrity, and even if he didn’t post on Weibo, anyone who was interested could still dig up information about his whereabouts. He had just surfed in Hawaii, then went to see glaciers, skied in Hokkaido, tried bungee jumping, cave diving, and wingsuit flying—he was living dangerously and carefree.
 

 
The two had completely different vacation styles. Netizens who were fans of the "Shi Zhao" CP were told to wake up.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t listening to reason.
 

 
As long as they were both on break at the same time, don’t ask, just assume they’ve gotten their marriage certificate.
 

 
This was a tabloid snippet, but what netizens were mainly discussing was what kind of movie Tong Zhao’s next project would be, and whether she would be collaborating with Shi Qianqiu. If the budget wasn’t a problem, would there be a male lead? Or would it be Han Zhi again?
 

 
Regarding the new movie, Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from his vacation, quickly clarified some rumors.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v:
 

 
The male lead for the new movie is not Han Zhi. It will most likely be a new actor.
 

 
It will be a brand-new version of Tong Zhao that you haven’t seen before.
 

 
No romance, just because a man and a woman are together doesn’t mean it’s love, right? That’s too cliché. When we’re collaborating on investments worth billions, gender doesn’t matter anymore in my heart. I just hope our next film turns out well.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s Weibo post was impressive, each line packed with a new revelation.
 

 
A brand-new version of Tong Zhao—netizens were puzzled, what kind of new version could she possibly have? Is she just going to change her image for every film? The third line clarifying there’s no romance wasn’t the key point anymore. After all, if they really were in a relationship, there’d be no need to hide it. If they kept insisting there’s nothing going on, it’s probably true. But Shi Qianqiu explicitly stated that the new movie was a commercial collaboration between him and Tong Zhao, involving investments of billions.
 

 
[Oh wow, this is heading for a big production!]
 

 
[Spending billions on a big movie and casting a newcomer as the male lead—that’s some serious boldness.]
 

 
[You’re dumb, does the male lead really matter when the movie has Tong Zhao? He’s not important, just a decoration. Wait and see, my Zhao will crush everything.]
 

 
Even those who weren’t Tong Zhao’s fans mostly held the stereotype that "Tong Zhao should always be at the center." With her shining like the brightest moon, other stars just seem to fade into the background.
 

 
So...
 

 
What kind of movie are Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao, this box-office-winning pair, preparing to make?
 

 
The industry couldn’t sit still.
 

 
If they couldn’t get to Tong Zhao, they’d try her agent. If they couldn’t find her agent, they’d start asking people who knew her—until even Jiang Dang relayed to Tong Zhao: [A lot of people are asking me if I can recommend them to you.]
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao was truly shocked.
 

 
After all, asking Jiang Dang for help was always risky.
 

 
Sometimes, he doesn’t listen to anyone or do what he’s supposed to.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed and asked him how those people had phrased it.
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment.
 

 
They had said a lot to him, speaking very humbly, putting on a very low profile. It seemed they were willing to take even a small, inconsequential role, though of course, a role with some screen time would be preferable.
 

 
[They said they... ]
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment again: [They want a small, supporting role.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [......]
 

 
So they put in a lot of effort just to ask for a small role?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t believe it, but it didn’t matter to her anymore. [Did you take any benefits from them? If you did, I can arrange a screen test for them.]
 

 
Jiang Dang sent a little cat shaking its head emoji.
 

 
Jiang Dang: [I told them... If such an opportunity comes up, I’ll just take it myself.]
 

 
He wasn't stupid.
# Chapter128
At Zeshan, it was Tong Zhao who led her team in business.
 

 
But when it came to investing in films, it was Shi Qianqiu who guided Tong Zhao. He meticulously taught her every intricate detail of the process involved in producing holographic films. This investment was different from the low-cost, high-return "Neverland Girl." It had a higher standard, requiring more attention to detail.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu discovered that even though Tong Zhao had already established herself as a box-office queen in the film industry, she was still very humble and eager to learn in unfamiliar areas. Her learning ability was exceptionally strong, making her a very pleasant student to teach.
 

 
However, having a strong learning ability was one thing.
 

 
What truly surprised Shi Qianqiu, though, was something else.
 

 
...
 

 
"I didn’t expect your imagination to be so rich."
 

 
Using the latest cutting-edge consciousness scanning technology, the professional team was able to transform the images from Tong Zhao's mind into holographic recordings. This effectively gave birth to the prototype of a new world: "I’ve seen plenty of fantasy films, but the world you imagine is quite... disturbing."
 

 
Tong Zhao silently stared at him.
 

 
It was as if she had just given a sarcastic teammate a question mark in a game.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu met her gaze calmly: "Isn’t it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't refute.
 

 
A month ago, it was... Iya, Sister Iya.
 

 
Iya: "It's Iya.”
 

 
Iya: "Don’t call me randomly, and no 'sister' either."
 

 
When Iya woke up, she had been searching for the right kind of antagonist. In the end, none of the scripts on the market suited her taste—she wanted a charming villain, one who could still captivate the audience even while committing evil deeds. After all, aren't movies and novels meant to provide enjoyment? In romance novels, the domineering CEO's forced love makes some readers swoon, and the obsessive, sickly types are all the rage. But if you meet such people in real life, the only thing you can say is "Run!"
 

 
The scripts that Tong Zhao flipped through generally had two types of villains:
 

 
1. The tool character.
 
2. The villain with a tragic backstory, inherently good at heart.
 

 
Iya wasn’t interested in the second type, claiming it went against the doctrine.
 

 
Iya: "Every person I kill when I’m in a frenzy, I hate them. This is the price I pay for accepting the Dark God's inheritance. The system has tried to remove it, but it only reduced the frequency of the episodes."
 

 
At first, she killed former cult members who had done many evil deeds, and Iya naturally hated them.
 

 
Later, however, she harmed herself.
 

 
She truly hated not noticing the truth of the Church sooner, and every moment when she failed to intervene in time.
 

 
So, the villain she would portray had to be someone who genuinely wanted to do evil—no tragic backstory, no redemption. Iya didn’t care whether the audience would hate the character. After all, it was just a performance; it wouldn't affect the actress personally. Tong Zhao had already played many likable, positive roles, but playing a major villain so early in her career needed more careful consideration.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a long time before finally going to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
She expressed all her requirements for the villain and then, slyly added, "I hope the audience will like her.”
 

 
This was a requirement that Iya hadn't mentioned.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao hoped the audience would like her.
 

 
The two of them hit it off right away. To discuss this matter, Shi Qianqiu had several video conferences with her. Each time, the background was different. Sometimes it was a sunny beach with his skin reddened by the sun, other times it was a freezing snow-covered landscape, and once, during a discussion about the character's details, the aurora lit up the sky behind him.
 

 
It was a sight that made people envious.
 

 
After several video meetings, Director Shi finally decided to focus and return home. He invited Tong Zhao to stay in one of his studios for about a week—along with his team. Their daily schedule consisted of brainstorming and refining the existing ideas.
 

 
What they ultimately settled on was a high-budget, special effects blockbuster.
 

 
A fantasy-themed film.
 

 
The worldview was provided by Tong Zhao, and Shi Qianqiu refined it.
 

 
They discussed whether to make it more complex or simpler.
 

 
Most big-budget films on the market are aimed at creating IP, so they naturally tend to be more complex. This way, it sets up potential sequels and the sale of merchandise. Additionally, the more complex the world-building, the more different it is from reality, making it easier for the audience to immerse themselves and believe that this is another world.
 

 
After seeing the world that Tong Zhao had "imagined," Shi Qianqiu chose the latter.
 

 
...
 

 
"The world you imagined has a fully developed system of evil."
 

 
"Under the banner of the God of Light, all the buildings appear luxurious and beautiful at first glance, even the poorest commoners value ritual. But as the story progresses, it unveils the dark and gloomy side of the world.”
 

 
"The world you've imagined has a unique and unified aesthetic, there’s no need to come up with a bunch of odd names to create a sense of mystery... I’ve always believed that those hard-to-remember names only serve to make it more difficult for the audience to write reviews, while creating a sense of superiority among the fanbase, making it a niche code of communication for this small circle."
 

 
"There’s really no need for that."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu set the tone for the new movie: "I want it to be a film where the audience can easily immerse themselves. When they think it's just a special effects action movie, the plot takes an unexpected turn and makes them question their life choices."
 

 
After hearing Shi Qianqiu’s grand theories, Tong Zhao gave him a blank stare.
 

 
Compared to Shi Qianqiu, even Jiang Dang could be described as cute.
 

 
There were so many people vying for a chance to audition that the team was overwhelmed. After much anticipation from the entire industry, the main cast was finally confirmed. When it came to casting, Tong Zhao didn’t give much input—after all, Shi Qianqiu was the one who had years of experience in selecting the right subconscious talents from auditions. One particularly strong statement from him was—
 

 
"I saw your potential before you even auditioned. Tell me, is it because my judgment is impeccable, or because you're just that impressive?"
 

 
Faced with the confident words of the great director Shi, Tong Zhao’s mood was a bit complicated. She felt a little like punching him.
 

 
What should she do if her own director was so punchable?
 

 
Waiting online, getting a bit urgent.
 

 
The production team’s WeChat group was one that Shi Qianqiu had added her to.
 

 
She usually kept quiet with strangers, so even though she was added, she wouldn’t have spoken unless necessary. However, once her name appeared, the group immediately exploded with messages welcoming her, especially from the male lead, Sun Sa.
 

 
Sun Sa: [Welcome, Sister Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
Sun Sa: [Sister Xiao Zhao, I'm your fan! Let's team up sometime! Please let me hug your thigh and rank up! I really love the role of the Imperial Concubine you played, and your little Zhao Zai, they're so cute. I’ve always dreamed of working with you. I can't believe my dream is finally coming true!]
 

 
Yu Zeqi: [Sister Xiao Zhao, don’t listen to him, he’s a dad fan, just wants to take advantage of you /dog head.]
 

 
Sun Sa, who wouldn’t turn 20 for another three months and was still attending film school, was over the moon after getting this huge opportunity. He was so excited, it almost felt like he was about to burst with happiness. His youthful enthusiasm was evident in his words, which made Shi Qianqiu a little annoyed and even more interested in tormenting him in the movie.
 

 
In the era of instinctual cinema, as long as the subconscious fit, it could even outweigh the drawbacks of inexperience.
 

 
After seeing Sun Sa, Tong Zhao understood why Shi Qianqiu had chosen him.
 

 
Other established actors just wouldn’t work.
 

 
They weren't as naive as him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Actually, if you’re looking for someone who’s both naive and handsome, I just thought of someone."
 

 
In the studio, Shi Qianqiu was fiddling with equipment. When he heard this, he glanced up at her: "Your little brat?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Yes, but I’m not recommending him, I just suddenly thought of him."
 

 
"I know, I’ve thought about him. He’s quite handsome, and his personality makes me want to bully him," only those particularly close to Shi Qianqiu knew that when he evaluated an actor’s potential, sometimes his criteria included whether he wanted to bully them in the film: "You two are too close, I’m worried it’ll affect his subconscious performance."
 

 
"Oh.”
 

 
Sun Sa had no idea that the director he admired so much, Shi Qianqiu, was secretly plotting ways to make him suffer in the holographic film. He was so excited that he couldn’t sleep well for three days. Everyone on his friend list knew by now that he had joined Shi Qianqiu’s new project and was even working with Tong Zhao. It was the opportunity of a lifetime!
 

 
This excitement lasted until he officially joined the crew and prepared to start filming.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t give the actors any scripts, claiming, "You’ll understand once you’re in."
 

 
Sun Sa didn’t suspect anything.
 

 
What bad intentions could Director Shi possibly have? After all, he was Sun Sa’s most respected idol!
 

 
And so, he happily climbed into the holographic filming pod.
 

 
---
 

 
Meanwhile, in her own holographic filming pod, Tong Zhao nervously ceded control to the alter personality, Iya. After weeks of preparation, Iya had been struggling to suppress her destructive urges. Her overwhelming desire for chaos had started to bleed into Tong Zhao's primary personality, to the point where even Tong Zhao herself found it hard to sleep.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Tong Zhao's sleek, graceful figure could often be seen sprawled over a couch, lightly gasping for breath like a fish out of water.
 

 
Iya: [I’m fine.]
 

 
Her tone carried the full weight of "I'm so done—let the world burn."
 

 
When the machinery began to operate, all the actors’ consciousnesses gradually blurred, as though being pulled into the depths of an endless ocean.

Cast List:
 

 
- Sun Sa as Dion
 

 
- Tong Zhao as Iya
 

 
- Yu Zeqi as Norlens
 

 
...followed by a long list of other actors.
 

 
---
 

 
The story is set in a fictional world on the continent of Garan.
 

 
Fantasy films often evoke images of Western elements like wizards and knights, so having Eastern actors portray such characters might feel somewhat out of place. But would Shi Qianqiu be the type of person to care about such things? He believed that fiction is fiction—it isn't Eastern nor Western. It's a story that unfolds in another dimension.
 

 
The protagonist, Dion, is an unremarkable young noble.
 

 
Though he is called a noble, it really just means he’s a bit wealthier than most people, with a relatively "noble" family name. Because of his distant relation to the main branch, he hasn't enjoyed much of the extravagant, decadent life of nobility. He’s never had to worry about basic needs, though. He only stands out because he has an exceptionally handsome face, which often makes him the target of jealousy from the main house's aristocrats.
 

 
Despite this, it has not affected his cheerful disposition and strong sense of justice.
 

 
Dion worships the God of Light.
 

 
His affinity with the God of Light is extremely high, and his faith is far stronger than his peers’.
 

 
Through Dion’s perspective, the world and background are lightly introduced.
 

 
Neither is particularly complex.
 

 
The more complicated a world is, the easier it is to find its flaws and contradictions. So, Shi Qianqiu chose the opposite approach: rather than complicating things, he used the visual spectacles created from Tong Zhao’s imagination to pull the audience into another world...
 

 
This December, the once-in-a-decade Red Moon will descend.
 

 
When the Red Moon appears, it marks the peak of the Dark God’s power. The sky will be covered with the blood-red moon, and dark creatures will wreak havoc across the entire continent of Garan. The followers of the God of Light will fight relentlessly to protect the capital.
 

 
This is a tradition in the capital, and Dion believes in it firmly.
 

 
He also hopes to join the ranks of the Holy Knights.
 

 
Moreover, the Pope has prophesied that this year’s Red Moon will be far more severe than previous ones...
 

 
Due to his excellent performance, Dion passes some smaller trials and earns the qualification to become a Holy Knight—
 

 
This part of the story progresses very quickly. The trials are challenging but not overly difficult. If the crew hadn’t already known what happens later in the script, they might’ve questioned whether these plot points were even written by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, Shi Qianqiu... would he really come up with problems that could be solved so easily?
 

 
He’s too much of a people pleaser!
 

 
This kind of plot is just not his style!
 

 
It feels off.
 

 
The beginning of the film's shoot felt like a fairy tale, with stunning architecture and an atmosphere as sacred as the sound of Brahman. Even though the name "God of Light" seemed a bit casually chosen, under the modelers' atmospheric design, the viewers could still feel the devotion of each character. The people of this continent deeply trusted the church and the God of Light...
 

 
This was, of course, intentional.
 

 
Because Shi Qianqiu had implanted faith commands into the subconscious minds of the extras. There was no need for any acting—the extras, in every moment of the holographic shoot, were devout followers, as if brainwashed. They never questioned the reality of the God of Light, and praying was as natural as eating, drinking, or using the restroom—it was an everyday task, something they did without thinking.
 

 
Through this method, the "brainwashed" effect that Tong Zhao wanted was achieved.
 

 
When the lighting and music were bright and cheerful, the atmosphere felt like a fairy tale.
 

 
The main plot of the film revolves around the upcoming arrival of the Red Moon. The entire nation is preparing for the onslaught of dark creatures. The Pope suggests that if they can travel deep into the Darkflower Forest and destroy one of the Dark God’s remaining temples, the strength of the dark creatures that are born will be reduced...
 

 
The Darkflower Forest is home to many dark creatures, making it extremely dangerous.
 

 
Due to the Dark God's barrier, anyone with weak faith who enters will be mentally deceived. Only those who pass certain trials can enter, and the number of people allowed is limited. If too many people go, the self-protecting mechanism of the Darkflower Forest will be triggered, and the army will be forcefully expelled—
 

 
So the question arises: If the barrier is so powerful, why not just stay in the capital?
 

 
Why go to the Darkflower Forest as a suicide soldier? Even if they were willing, their families wouldn’t permit it.
 

 
"During the auditions, many of the actors didn’t have the courage in their subconscious."
 

 
A modeler, watching the filming from backstage, complained, “Actually, all Director Shi needs to do is reduce the fear factor of the Darkflower Forest in their minds. It's all adjustable."
 

 
The assistant director shook his head in disagreement. "Someone like Sun Sa, who knows there's a tiger on the mountain but is so easily swayed by justice that he walks straight into the tiger's den, is exactly the type Director Shi likes!"
 

 
"You call Sun Sa a fool?"
 

 
"I mean he's a hero, a brave soul."
 

 
"I clearly heard you just say..."
 

 
"No, you didn't."
 

 
Though Sun Sa wasn’t a big celebrity with a powerful background, the assistant director felt a bit awkward for blurting that out and realized it was impolite.
 

 
However, as the director in charge of the entire production, Shi Qianqiu still sat in his director’s chair, biting into a red apple. He stared at the shooting screen, lost in thought, seemingly unaware of their casual conversation.
 

 
Meanwhile, the filming progressed to the part where Sun Sa’s character, Dion, took on the nearly suicidal mission.
 

 
“Hahahahaha!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu took a bite of half an apple and slapped his thigh, “Fool!”
 

 
Within that burst of laughter, there was a hint of affection.
 

 
“...”
 

 
The other staff members fell silent.
 

 
Now, back to the movie.
 

 
Another actor, Yu Zeqi, playing Norence, also passed the test. Though she wasn’t as brave as Sun Sa, under the background setup, she had her own reasons for going—if she succeeded in the mission, even if she didn’t survive, her family would receive a large amount of compensation. Moreover, her brother had died in the Darkflower Forest, and she was determined to find out what kind of place it really was.
 

 
With the knights and mages in place, the church finally assigned them a red-robed saintess.
 

 
The saintess specialized in healing and purification magic.
 

 
It was said that this saintess came from a faraway village, and after going through numerous trials, she had finally made it to the capital’s temple. However, due to some misdeed, she had been marginalized. Though she wasn’t outright eliminated, she was still assigned to a mission like this, to the Darkflower Forest...
 

 
It was almost as if they were sending her to her death.
 

 
...
 

 
“Hey, what do you think the saintess will be like?”
 

 
Norence was getting a bit irritated thinking about how her "death day" was approaching. She was skilled with water magic, and if it weren’t for the urgent need for money at home to treat an illness, she wouldn’t have come on this trip. She was hoping to see a powerful saintess who could increase their team’s chances of survival.
 

 
“I don’t know.”
 

 
Dion shook his head.
 

 
Saintesses rarely appeared outside the temple, and they would never casually converse with strange men. He had only seen the saintess from a distance during the Light Festival.
 

 
The one he saw back then was a true saintess.
 

 
The one assigned to them, at best, could only be considered a contender for the position of saintess.
 

 
“Don’t you fear death?” Norence asked irritably.
 

 
“Of course I fear it, but…”
 

 
Dion, the "fool," placed his hand on the knight’s sword at his waist and solemnly declared, “To defend the glory of the Light God, it is our duty!”
 

 
Norence was speechless.
 

 
Off-camera, Shi Qianqiu was laughing so hard that he couldn’t even eat his apple anymore.
 

 
Others were puzzled.
 

 
Sun Sa was handsome, the kind of handsome with sharp brows and bright eyes, the youthful, composed type. So when he said these words, it came from a deep sense of duty. Where’s the joke in that? After laughing, Shi Qianqiu instructed the stage crew, "Make a note of this. He needs a fitting background music; without it, this line sounds too cringey."
 

 
Norence was at a loss for words for a moment when the church’s clergy appeared with the saintess.
 

 
When it was time for Tong Zhao to make her entrance, Shi Qianqiu put down his apple and didn’t miss a single frame. He was clearly excited, like an artisan who had just gotten the perfect materials…
 

 
Iya was a very special character.
 

 
Even Shi Qianqiu had reservations about whether Tong Zhao’s subconscious could deliver the performance he wanted.
 

 
The assistant director even directly said he didn’t think Tong Zhao was suitable.
 

 
With such a high investment, they should have chosen a safer option. However, taking a step back, even if Tong Zhao didn’t portray Iya the way they originally intended, it would be entirely possible to adjust the script for her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s box office draw was undeniable—changing the script would be nothing.
 

 
When the clergy brought the saintess onto the set, Norence’s eyes filled with disappointment.
 

 
The young girl seemed very young, frail as if a gust of wind could knock her over. Her eyes were covered. Even without seeing her expression, one could sense her timid, fearful nature from her body language. She kept her head down, as if she feared the presence of the two others.
 

 
“…My name is Iya.”
 

 
…
 

 
This was also the reason the assistant director didn’t think Tong Zhao could pull off Iya.
 

 
He was actually a fan of hers, a big fan.
 

 
He had recorded ‘One Life Survivor’ and watched it over and over again. A fierce woman who could single-handedly kill twenty enemies—could her subconscious be weak?
 

 
If she wasn’t weak enough, the audience wouldn’t be able to let their guard down.
 

 
And the girl who appeared on screen now was clearly a textbook example of weakness—beautiful but otherwise useless.
# Chapter129
When the filming ended, Sun Sa woke up with a start.
 

 

 

 
He pressed his hand to his chest, and the motion caused a tangle of wires and equipment attached to his body.
 

 

 

 
“Ah... damn…”
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa raised his hand and rubbed his forehead.
 

 

 

 
The stagehand handed him a warm towel to wipe his face.
 

 

 

 
After wiping his face, he did indeed feel better, but a huge sense of emptiness still filled his chest. He had some experience with instinctive films during his school days. Although the length and intensity couldn’t compare to a full-fledged shoot, he at least knew what the feeling was like after filming an instinctive movie.
 

 

 

 
Although his memory hadn’t fully recovered, the experiences from the "dream" remained, about one-tenth of it, with those more susceptible to dream influence feeling it more deeply. From Sun Sa’s past experience, he wasn’t particularly sensitive. Even after going through the trauma of losing his family during filming, he would only feel slightly down afterward. A quick face wash and he could head out to play a murder mystery game with friends, go clubbing, or enjoy a hotpot.
 

 

 

 
But now…
 

 

 

 
The stagehand watched the young, handsome guy, who was now dejected and gloomy, and couldn’t help but ask, “Do you need to apply for psychological counseling?”
 

 

 

 
For large productions like ‘The Iya Myth’, a team doctor was essential.
 

 

 

 
To prevent any psychological issues from arising in the instinctive actors.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, then shook his head. “No, it’s not necessary…”
 

 

 

 
In fact, needing psychological counseling was a very normal demand. But this was Sun Sa’s first time acting in an instinctive film, and he didn’t want others to think he was being too difficult. So after wiping his face, he went back to the dorm room arranged for him by the production team and silently lay down on the bed for a while.
 

 

 

 
He couldn’t sleep.
 

 

 

 
His chest felt tight and heavy.
 

 

 

 
After tossing and turning in bed for a while, Sun Sa went to the automatic vending machine in the hallway to buy cigarettes and a lighter. He had quit smoking for a long time, but today, he felt so frustrated that he couldn’t get through it without a cigarette. He returned to his room, lit up, and smoked one cigarette after another until the entire pack was gone. His throat felt tight and sore.
 

 

 

 
At his worst, Sun Sa’s smoking addiction wasn’t even this bad.
 

 

 

 
Finishing a whole pack in one go made him feel like he was going to throw up. He grabbed some candy provided by the dormitory, chewed it, but it had no taste.
 

 

 

 
He thought for a moment and finally decided to reach out to his manager for help.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [Brother Chen, I’ve finished filming.]
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [I feel worse than eating shit right now.]
 

 

 

 
The manager was shocked but also a little amused. How could anyone describe themselves like that? Still, he patiently comforted him for a while, reassuring him that it would get better once the film was released. Sun Sa had a vague sense that once his memories returned, he would feel even worse than he did now.
 

 

 

 
Brother Chen: [Look on the bright side, once the movie comes out and you become famous, none of this will matter.]
 

 

 

 
Indeed, who doesn’t love fame and fortune?
 

 

 

 
Thinking about the fame and more acting opportunities coming his way, Sun Sa felt a little uplifted.
 

 

 

 
Like many people who ignore their emotional problems, he thought the public would be happy for his wealth and recognition, so he had no reason to be unhappy. He chose to suppress his “sensitive” thoughts and tried to stay on track...
 

 

 

 
---
 

 

 

 
‘The Iya Myth’ has wrapped up filming and editing begins!
 

 

 

 
A large-scale fantasy production, extravagant special effects, an independent worldview, and a powerful collaboration between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu...
 

 

 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu boldly lowered the rental rate of the material code to below 30%, meaning 70% of the code for ‘The Iya Myth’ was custom-built by the production team. This required not only manpower and resources, but also Shi Qianqiu’s confidence in his team’s abilities. If this film becomes a hit, even if he never directs again, just taking on outsourcing projects could earn him sky-high fees!
 

 

 

 
He was taking a huge gamble.
 

 

 

 
Making an instinctive film was always a gamble, and Shi Qianqiu, in particular, was a gambler who loved to bet everything on a single throw.
 

 

 

 
Someone dug up Shi Qianqiu's personal signature:
 

 

 

 
"Gambling is about restraint, low cost is the real indulgence."
 

 

 

 
What does that mean? The logic and phrasing are complete nonsense.
 

 

 

 
A netizen pointed out that he must still be thinking about ‘The Neverland Girl’, which was his lowest-cost film, and this time, with ‘The Iya Myth’, he’s finally getting the chance to shine.
 

 

 

 
[Wow, he truly deserves the title of the man who burns the most money in the film industry.]
 

 

 

 
[Zhao Zhao is probably the woman who makes the most money in the film industry, right?]
 

 

 

 
[If ‘The Iya Myth’ becomes a hit, she’ll probably be the box office queen this year.]
 

 

 

 
[The person above clearly hasn’t been keeping up with the numbers. If ‘The Iya Myth’ doesn’t blow up, she’ll still be the box office queen. If it does blow up, she’s already reserved the spot for the annual champion, ignoring gender. No man can beat her.]
 

 

 

 
Movies with a male lead are more common than those with a female lead — that’s the ceiling for actresses.
 

 

 

 
How many big female-lead films are there in a year? It’s impossible for all of them to be taken by Tong Zhao. But since she’s so good at making money and has connections, she started producing her own films, making them for herself without needing to cater to anyone’s preferences.
 

 

 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was Tong Zhao’s first film as a producer. Entertainment forums had hot posts calculating its cost and profits, and the return on investment was so high that netizens were amazed, lamenting how easy it is to make money in the entertainment industry.
 

 

 

 
Immediately, industry insiders rolled their eyes and replied.
 

 

 

 
They didn’t say much, just posted about this year’s instinctive films that bombed, showing how much they lost.
 

 

 

 
For every flop, it usually takes one and a half successful films to make up for the loss.
 

 

 

 
There will always be winners, but no one wins forever.
 

 

 

 
[But isn’t it true that Tong Zhao has never lost?]
 

 

 

 
[……]
 

 

 

 
[Aren’t we supposed to be discussing Shi Qianqiu here?]
 

 

 

 
[Has he never lost?]
 

 

 

 
The conversation couldn't continue after this, and the post discussing the data ended up turning into a lemon orchard, where people had to admit that some individuals are just born to conquer audiences.
 

 

 

 
There’s no doubt that the core of the discussion about ‘The Iya Myth’ is Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
However, a recent piece of negative news has caused even more heated discussions —
 

 

 

 
“‘The Iya Myth’ male lead Sun Sa suffers from a mental disorder!”
 

 

 

 
The news was exposed by a malicious media outlet known for using various borderline legal tactics to obtain sensational stories. This time, they revealed a wiretapping scandal and traced it back to Sun Sa's secondary Weibo account.
 

 

 

 
When a scandal breaks out, a typical male celebrity's secondary Weibo account might contain sweet messages with a mistress.
 

 

 

 
But what about Sun Sa?
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe (LittleWindNotHappy):
 

 

 

 
I can't let go, I think about her every night. I can’t move on, I can’t get out.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
Why do I have to suffer like this? She really is my ideal type.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
I want to write your name on a cigarette and inhale it into my lungs.
 

 

 

 
Before filming ‘The Iya Myth’, Sun Sa was a typical film school student with no messy girlfriend fanbase. So, this secondary account leak didn’t cause a mass unfollow — after all, he had no fans to begin with. But this heavy-hearted post on Weibo intrigued netizens, sparking curiosity.
 

 

 

 
[Who is this “she”?]
 

 

 

 
[I'm so curious about who made this guy care so much.]
 

 

 

 
[Why call yourself Xiao Feng? Is it because you can't stand up anymore?] 
 

 

 

 
[The person above is just like the car that goes to kindergarten/(dog emoji)] 
 

 

 

 
[Though, that line about inhaling it into the lungs really felt so corny, patting the little brother’s head.] 
 

 

 

 
The ambiguous posts on his secondary Weibo account were unclear, but the leaked wiretap audio cleared up the confusion— 
 

 

 

 
— “I’ve been thinking about Sister Xiao Zhao all day.” 
 

 
— “I really want to go on variety shows to promote, I can’t wait to be in the same frame as her, but I’m also afraid to meet her in person.” 
 

 
— “Because maybe what I like is the character she plays... I wish it wouldn’t end... but if it doesn’t end, it doesn’t really make a difference.” 
 

 
— “I have to take melatonin to fall asleep.” 
 

 

 

 
The audio was very clear. Fortunately, even though he was dealing with emotional issues, Sun Sa still remembered his confidentiality agreement and didn’t reveal the source of his distress. So even though the conversation was wiretapped and leaked, it didn’t spoil the plot of the new film, but it did provide an additional topic for discussion.
 

 

 

 
After the news broke, the ‘The Iya Myth’ team immediately arranged psychological counseling for Sun Sa. 
 

 

 

 
It was then discovered that, despite his agent saying that it would pass, Sun Sa had not only tasted the bitterness of fame, but was still troubled. Because of the deep suppression and his constant denial of his emotional problems, the emotional strain had accumulated to the point of almost festering. Afterward, Sun Sa felt very guilty and apologized profusely to Tong Zhao, who told him to focus on recovering: “This shows how desperately the media wanted news about ‘The Iya Myth’… they’d go to such lengths... It’s not your fault; who could’ve predicted this? But next time you’re filming a holographic movie, make sure to consult with a doctor if needed—emotions are never trivial.”
 

 

 

 
Of course, it wasn’t his fault. 
 

 

 

 
The blame lay with the intrusive paparazzi. 
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao even felt a little sorry. This wasn’t something a newcomer should have to face... he had only just turned twenty, and all of this was because this was her movie. People were willing to go to any lengths to get news related to her. However, considering the rewards he could gain from ‘The Iya Myth’, this small suffering was nothing in comparison. 
 

 

 

 
So, during the meeting, Tong Zhao’s words, which were about to be spoken, reverted to a cold tone:
 

 

 

 
"With ‘The Iya Myth’, both my and Sun Sa's Baidu indexes have been rising rapidly. On the bright side, we’re not without benefits; even if rumors about us circulate, it won’t affect me." From an objective perspective, this was even a win-win type of publicity; the only thing that was harmed was Sun Sa’s mental health—the feeling of his personal privacy being violated made him more uneasy, as he was already struggling with emotional issues: "Now, there are two options: either not clarify the rumors and continue the gossip about me and him..."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao had a mature PR and marketing team, who earned a generous fee each year to handle such public relations crises.
 

 

 

 
As her status rose, her team also began to take her feelings more into consideration.
 

 

 

 
Everyone quietly listened to her decision.
 

 

 

 
"My answer is no. The film's quality is excellent, and there's no need to use this type of news to promote it. That would just play into the paparazzi’s hands. Let’s redirect the focus back to the film itself. We can clarify that Sun Sa is obsessed with the character I play in the movie—he even mentioned it in the audio recording. Outside of the movie, it's not the same thing."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t try to exaggerate her tone.
 

 

 

 
She remained calm and composed, delivering her words decisively, and no one in the room challenged her stance.
 

 

 

 
At the right moment, Shi Qianqiu interjected to ease the atmosphere: "We can create a smoke screen, let the netizens believe that ‘The Iya Myth’ is a particularly sweet romance between the male and female leads."
 

 

 

 
Those who had seen the original film gave him a look of approval. 
 

 

 

 
Such a sharp move, Director Shi!
 

 

 

 
The head of the PR team nodded: "We can arrange that. The data shows that the netizens' attitude is still relatively calm, and the mainstream voice is condemning the media for using wiretapping to get news about a new actor who's only twenty years old. Some fans also don’t want you to choose..."
 

 

 

 
He paused for a moment: "A boyfriend weaker than Xiao Zhao."
 

 

 

 
In Eastern cultures, people tend to subconsciously disapprove of relationships where the woman is stronger than the man.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao gestured to indicate that she no longer wanted to discuss the matter.
 

 

 

 
The team quickly picked up on the hint and steered the conversation back to how to manage the public relations.
 

 

 

 
*
 

 

 

 
The clarification of the rumors about Tong Zhao and Sun Sa happened quickly.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao herself did not speak out, which in itself was a statement— 
 

 

 

 
The matter was trivial, laughably false. Did they really think they could get her to respond by using cheap tactics? Go back and think about whether they even deserved her attention. The PR team then issued a statement through the film’s channels that afternoon. First, they condemned the wiretapping as an invasion of privacy, then mentioned that Sun Sa was actively seeking psychological treatment after the filming, asking everyone to focus on the new movie instead.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa did not appear, but a reporter released a video of him being interviewed outside his building. In the video, the young man looked dejected and visibly worn out, which immediately sparked netizens' sympathy.
 

 

 

 
Soon after, a version of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was released.
 

 

 

 
How touching must the movie be for a handsome young man like him to be so affected by it?
 

 

 

 
The quality of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was top-notch, merely revealing a glimpse of the scenery in the film, but it quickly shifted the focus of the viewers.
 

 

 

 
In the trailer, Sun Sa’s character, Dion, is dressed in a platinum-colored knight's armor, holding Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
The official stills for ‘The Iya Myth’ hadn't been released yet.
 

 

 

 
This was the first time netizens had seen Tong Zhao's look in the new film.
 

 

 

 
In this shot, she slightly lowers her long, elegant neck, her delicate, fair shoulder trembling slightly in the wind, exuding a sense of fragility. When she lifts her head, she reveals her eyes hidden behind a lace eye mask, covering her usual electrifying gaze and making her appear even more vulnerable.
 

 

 

 
["Their mission is to destroy the temple of the Dark God, but Dion secretly vows in his heart as a knight—"]
 

 

 

 
["He must protect the Holy Lady."]
 

 

 

 
Next, the female antagonist Norence's loud shout:
 

 

 

 
["She's just a useless burden who only holds us back! Don’t you understand? We should leave her here—"]
 

 

 

 
Just as the words end, Iya softly pulls on the male lead's sleeve: "Don’t leave me..."
 

 

 

 
This should have seemed very cliché.
 

 

 

 
However, Tong Zhao was simply too beautiful. Watching this scene, netizens, both male and female, couldn’t help but sympathize with the male lead, feeling protective of the delicate beauty. After all, it’s a movie, and the protagonist will always overcome adversity, right? What’s wrong with taking care of the little beauty? Of course, to make it seem like Tong Zhao wasn’t just a burden, the trailer also cleverly included scenes where her character points the way for the team, suggesting that she is actually quite useful.
 

 

 

 
The trailer was packed with information. Netizens only knew that the main team was undertaking a dangerous mission, with Tong Zhao playing the Holy Lady, who possesses healing magic. She is frail, kind, and gentle, earning the approval of the initially hostile female antagonist by protecting her teammates.
 

 

 

 
The trailer ends with Tong Zhao getting injured while protecting the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Blood slowly trickles down from her head, staining her platinum hair and fair face. The male lead, filled with pity and heartache, gently caresses her cheek and kisses her forehead.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
[Isn't this just as intense as ‘Boruto: Naruto Next Generations’?]
 

 

 

 
[What just happened? I feel like I’ve been sweetened. The plot seems a bit simple, but with her looks alone, it’s worth it.]
 

 

 

 
[I thought I was already immune to Tong Zhao’s beauty, but I didn’t expect her to reach new heights in her new movie. Is that platinum-colored hair real? I can totally understand why Sun Sa couldn’t move on after filming, and also, Xiao Sa’s looks are amazing, he really could be in an idol drama.]
 

 

 

 
[You guys only noticed the looks of the leads? Did you forget about the 70% exclusive set codes promoted for ‘The Iya Myth’? These are scenes you can only see in this movie! Several wide shots are so beautiful and luxurious, no wonder they match Shi Qianqiu’s taste; it's absolutely perfect.]
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
The comments are all praises.
 

 

 

 
For a big-budget commercial film like ‘The Iya Myth’, most of the audience comes to enjoy the spectacle. The holographic immersive experience and a bit of fresh innovation in the storyline, as long as they don’t feed us nonsense, it’s already good enough. The trailer only gave the main storyline, revealing very little of the plot, but the visuals were clearly meticulously crafted, the budget is ample, and it made viewers want to buy the holographic movie rights and continue following its release...
 

 

 

 
This is the mainstream opinion.
 

 

 

 
And Tong Zhao’s fans, especially the beauty-focused ones, are absolutely satisfied!
 

 

 

 
It’s as if overnight, the entire Weibo and some entertainment forums were filled with discussions about the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer. Sun Sa, as expected, reaped the benefits of being tied to Tong Zhao. Plus, he’s really handsome, and under Shi Qianqiu’s direction, he particularly gives off that "knight in shining armor" vibe. His smile is full of sunshine, and he’s straightforward and clear-headed.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa has undeniably become the best on-screen partner for Tong Zhao since her debut.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang played the villain, and in the film, Tong Zhao had another boyfriend.
 

 

 

 
As for Han Zhi, well, that’s actually Tong Zhao herself.
 

 

 

 
When you count them all up, Sun Sa takes the top spot.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans are not too happy about it—
 

 

 

 
After all, when CPs are hyped, the lesser-known side is usually thrilled, while the popular side doesn't really want to be dragged along. But since the new film is coming out, and Sun Sa’s private social media posts were found to be quite fan-oriented, some of Tong Zhao’s fans could relate to him. So, the atmosphere among fans is somewhat harmonious, and there hasn't been much fighting.
 

 

 

 
However, the trailer and the official stills from ‘The Iya Myth’, with the two of them in the same frame, are just too perfect!
 

 

 

 
The pure and noble saintess, and the knight who only wants to protect the gods with an untainted heart—if this isn’t the perfect pairing, then what is? The official couple has the sky as their limit, with so much sweetness that you can't get enough of it!
 

 

 

 
[Isn’t a saintess paired with a little puppy dog charming?]
 

 

 

 
[If I want a little puppy dog, I’d rather go for the rich young master…]
 

 

 

 
[I just hope the newcomer doesn’t drag Tong Zhao down.]
 

 

 

 
At some point, whenever Tong Zhao makes a move, it feels like a national celebration. The internet is buzzing with discussions about her, and in real life, mentioning her name often sparks a conversation.
 

 

 

 
Just this level of popularity is priceless.
 

 

 

 
There’s no helping it—every time she has a new project, not only does she never disappoint, but she also constantly delivers surprises.
 

 

 

 
She’s the most watchable actor among the performers in the "Instinct" film series.
 

 

 

 
With overwhelming promotion, many audience members who pre-booked tickets are eager to witness the sweet romance and the magnificent otherworldly scenery. Even before the movie has been released, many already love Tong Zhao’s saintess look, which gives off a high-and-mighty vibe.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
On the first day of the ‘The Iya Myth’ premiere, what was the audience's reaction after the first screening?
 

 

 

 
Their response was the same as Sun Sa’s that day.
 

 

 

 
Thousands of words turned into a single exclamation: "Wow!"
 

 

 

 
This "wow" made those who hadn’t managed to catch the first screening panic.
 

 

 

 
[Stop just saying "wow", give us some real content! I’m not afraid of spoilers!]
 

 

 

 
——[Don’t say you’re not afraid of spoilers, this movie really isn’t something you should watch after being spoiled. I suggest you go watch the first public screening ASAP, or you’ll be hit by spoilers everywhere. Seriously, it’s so damn… I’ll never believe in love again!]
 

 

 

 
Hearing this, some viewers thought the person was throwing a metaphorical knife.
 

 

 

 
What exactly was the situation?
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, who was resting at home, saw the first batch of movie reviews online and couldn't help but feel a sense of sympathy.
 

 

 

 
It was no use—every time he closed his eyes, he kept thinking about his saintess sister…
# Chapter130
Spoilers are inevitable.
 

 

 

 
Spoilers with a warning are a harmonious form of sharing, while spoilers without any warning may be due to a lack of awareness, or in some cases, from those who deliberately seek to upset others. And then there are those who, even as the movie is about to leave theaters, still criticize spoiler warnings. In short, human nature is such that it cannot be completely avoided.
 

 

 

 
However, with the rise of immersive films today, copyright awareness and viewing etiquette have both improved. The vast majority of people are now mindful of not spoiling movies or, at the very least, they give proper warnings when they do. The remaining few are those who deliberately seek to upset others, rushing to spoil the movie for fans who have been eagerly anticipating it but couldn't attend the premiere due to their work schedules.
 

 

 

 
So what is the true purpose of these malicious individuals?
 

 

 

 
Is it about spoiling the movie?
 

 

 

 
No, it's the thrill they get from successfully annoying others with the spoilers!
 

 

 

 
After watching 'The Iya Myth', these mischief-makers didn't escape the fate of being ironically punished by the ultimate behind-the-scenes boss, Shi Qianqiu, who left them utterly confused and humiliated. The more logical and justified his methods were, the harder it was for them to accept.
 

 

 

 
What were they thinking when they decided to spoil the movie?
 

 

 

 
If they spoiled it...
 

 

 

 
The viewers who later watched it would already be mentally prepared, carrying a protective shield with them, so they wouldn’t be as upset.
 

 

 

 
Is this good?
 

 

 

 
No, it’s not!!!
 

 

 

 
These little troublemakers, who thought they could annoy others through spoilers, all unknowingly closed their mouths.
 

 

 

 
If “throwing shade” were an art form, then Shi Qianqiu would be the master. His traditional skill was to coat the blade with the sweetest sugar, and Tong Zhao was the sharpest blade in his hands. Some fans were amused to find that 'The Iya Myth' didn’t have spoilers flying all over the place on its opening day. They were able to catch it after work, curious to see what it was all about.
 

 

 

 
Smiling when they entered the theater, and leaving with tears in their eyes.
 

 

 

 
A lively scene appeared in the review section—
 

 

 

 
"Can Shi Qianqiu just die?????"
 

 

 

 
"I’m so stupid, really, how could I believe in that old crook Shi's movie!"
 

 

 

 
"Summary of Shi Qianqiu's movie: A dazzling, jewel-encrusted knife."
 

 

 

 
"Isn’t this even more tear-jerking than ‘The Day of Becoming a God’???"
 

 

 

 
Even viewers who aren’t interested in fantasy genres were intrigued by the flood of angry comments, and started replying with questions: 
 

 
"Is the movie really bad? Did Tong Zhao’s reputation explode? Is the movie boring?"
 

 

 

 
Once the question about the movie's quality was raised, the viewers who had been furiously criticizing Shi Qianqiu suddenly fell silent, their attitudes shifting:
 

 

 

 
"The movie? It’s not bad, it’s really good..."
 

 

 

 
"But until you reach the end, you’ll never believe what kind of movie this is."
 

 

 

 
"You dare call this a love story?/dog head"
 

 

 

 
"There is love, and there’s definitely a lot of fantasy too. If you go just for the special effects, it’s worth it. Sister Zhao’s reputation didn’t explode, but her beauty and aura certainly did. Sigh, once you watch it, you’ll get it. I’m going for a second viewing, all for the saintess sister."
 

 

 

 
You can’t bully Shi Qianqiu for not having fans; he does have fans. On forums and Weibo, people started analyzing the movie: 
 

 

 

 
"Shi’s films, the first time you watch them, you watch the people, the second time, you watch the scenery, and the third time, you can actually understand the plot."
 

 

 

 
Not entirely clear, but it feels impressive.
 

 

 

 
Of course, it's not just word of mouth; the film’s marketing team didn’t spare any effort either. As soon as Sun Sa’s emotional state slightly stabilized, he and Tong Zhao appeared together on two variety shows. With an expensive promotional push, many fans who were already looking forward to Tong Zhao’s new work, along with curious netizens, bought the holographic movie tickets...
 

 

 

 
So what kind of movie 'The Iya Myth' actually is?
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
Due to its high investment, 'The Iya Myth' introduced the latest immersive viewing method.
 

 

 

 
This technology allows you to immerse yourself in a specific character, although you cannot speak or influence the plot. It’s like a solitary soul attaching itself to the character, experiencing the film from their first-person perspective, while also feeling their psychological changes. Due to the complexity of the technology, it can currently only be "possessed" by the main characters, as there isn’t enough data collected for supporting this technology with secondary characters.
 

 

 

 
Of course, this comes at an additional cost.
 

 

 

 
It’s a special service that traditional films cannot offer.
 

 

 

 
Because it’s very expensive, with high costs, only a few big-budget movies each year can afford to implement this.
 

 

 

 
So when 'The Iya Myth' only offered the option to experience the perspective of the male lead, Dion, there were some complaints, but most moviegoers agreed with the decision. After all, with the first-person perspective, you can't see "yourself," so whether they’re watching Tong Zhao or Sun Sa, most would still choose the former.
 

 

 

 
After all, the ticket price was a bit high, and those willing to pay for it were mostly doing so out of trust in Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, or they were truly passionate about the immersive viewing experience.
 

 

 

 
So this group of core movie fans immersed themselves in the character of Dion.
 

 

 

 
Among them was also Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
This technology was so advanced that you couldn’t experience it at home with just a helmet; you had to go to the cinema. He thought it would be a bit sad to go alone, so he bought an extra ticket to invite his manager to come along. But his manager said it was inconvenient.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [What’s inconvenient about it?]
 

 

 

 
Manager: [I need to go with my wife, you can go to the cinema by yourself. It’s better if you don’t bring any girls.]
 

 

 

 
Subtext: You’ve got no one to go with, but I’ve got someone.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo immediately felt a little defeated.
 

 

 

 
Actually, going alone would be fine, but since he had already bought the ticket, he gave up and posted a moment on his social media, thinking, "What if fate steps in?" He had a lot of pretty girls on WeChat who chatted with him from time to time, but he wasn't interested. He always felt it was pointless.
 

 

 

 
Like many well-off single guys.
 

 

 

 
A psychological "sea king" but an action "lonely king."
 

 

 

 
Then, someone Song Wanzhuo never expected left a comment.
 

 

 

 
Not only that, but they also sent him a private message, with a voice note.
 

 

 

 
——[I’m free that day, we can watch it together.]
 

 

 

 
Such a gentle, sexy voice.
 

 

 

 
Too bad it was a guy.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Wait, Jiang Dang, are you sure you want to watch it with me????]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [What's wrong with that?]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [A little kitten peeking out of the trash can.jpg]
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Fine, fine, let’s go watch it. But don’t act cute, I’m not into that.]
 

 

 

 
It was just a meme saved casually, and Jiang Dang didn’t think he was acting cute. He was already planning to see Tong Zhao’s movie, and since he saw it on social media, he decided to invite Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
As for Song Wanzhuo, he was being more practical.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang was getting really popular lately, even more than him, so there was no harm in getting more familiar with him.
 

 

 

 
The two of them, fully armed, arrived at the cinema on the third day of 'The Iya Myth'’s release.
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's eyes, they began their adventure in the land of Garan.
 

 

 

 
The first fifteen minutes didn’t feature Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
"I can’t wait to see Tong Zhao, but the movie itself isn’t boring. While Dion is passing the test to earn his knight status, it also introduces the world-building. Such mature narrative shots, no wonder it’s directed by Shi Qianqiu," Song Wanzhuo rambled, commenting. The first fifteen minutes were very traditional for an action movie, with some flashy, expensive scenery: “Damn it, the male lead isn’t just a decoration in the movie, this newcomer is making a killing. I’m so jealous. How come this luck didn’t fall on me? I feel like my subconscious is quite similar to his.”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s subconscious image was quite mature.
 

 

 

 
He was a calm, composed, authoritative leader-type personality, with a touch of "bro culture."
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang nodded seriously: “Yeah, how come this kind of luck didn’t fall on me? My subconscious is also quite suitable for it.”
 

 

 

 
“...”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo turned to look at him: “Are you serious?”
 

 

 

 
“Seriously.”
 

 

 

 
You might have a misunderstanding about what "subconscious" means…
 

 

 

 
After looking at that handsome face, which seemed oblivious to how problematic it was, Song Wanzhuo decided it was better to put on his helmet and focus on the movie.
 

 

 

 
The movie progressed to the point where the female lead, Iya, made her appearance.
 

 

 

 
In the immersive experience, the audience could fully feel the shock in the heart of the male lead, Dion, when he first saw the Saintess Iya.
 

 

 

 
Even without the immersive experience, just from the holographic viewing, they could still empathize with him.
 

 

 

 
How could it be more beautiful than the scenes in the trailer that had been enhanced?
 

 

 

 
The young girl stepped forward and bowed. The light from the temple illuminated her face, and for a moment, all the audience held their breath, unable to take their eyes off her. She was so fragile and delicate, every strand of her hair glowing as if bathed in light. The pity for the weak was not just a man's privilege; even the female audience members who came to the cinema with their boyfriends at this moment couldn’t help but feel the desire to engage in a yuri romance with her.
 

 

 

 
Being a beauty addict knows no gender.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo was the typical example of a straight man audience member who was struck by an aesthetic blow.
 

 

 

 
“My god… just watching her face alone makes it worth it. Wuwu, she should take more beautiful, beautiful movies like this, and fewer fighting action films. A woman’s gentleness and fragility are so alluring. I am just Dion, I want to protect the Saintess for the rest of my life!”
 

 

 

 
He whispered as he watched the movie.
 

 

 

 
Anyway, it was a private box, so it wouldn't disturb anyone else.
 

 

 

 
“She is indeed beautiful.”
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang paused: “But I think she’s also very charming when she’s fighting.”
 

 

 

 
Especially when she’s fighting against him.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s obsession with her looks was interrupted again.
 

 

 

 
Thankfully, the immersive experience, where he could enjoy Tong Zhao’s gentle words from the male lead’s perspective, was an absolute treat for a fanboy like him, making his desire to protect her grow to unprecedented levels.
 

 

 

 
The main plot of 'The Iya Myth' revolves around the crisis brought by the red moon and the Light Festival.
 

 

 

 
The Pope promises that if Iya completes her mission and returns alive, he will choose her to be the true Saintess of the Royal Church in the capital.
 

 

 

 
The main storyline and pacing of a commercial blockbuster are typically very clear, and this was a shared understanding among the audience. So when this "carrot" was dangled in front of them, they instinctively remembered it and confidently thought—yeah, this is probably the reward the protagonist will get in the grand finale, not bad at all.
 

 

 

 
The plotline follows the protagonist's team as they venture into the Dark Flower Forest to destroy the Dark Temple, with dangers in the forest serving as a secondary element of the story.
 

 

 

 
Mediocre movies often stretch the runtime, but excellent movies don’t have dull moments. 'The Iya Myth' has a fast-paced storyline. The main group quickly enters the Dark Flower Forest, introducing a new visual spectacle— 
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's perspective, a dense fog surrounds them, and Norence cautiously sets up a barrier. This young magician is soon horrified to find that his barrier is useless; they are pulled into an illusion.
 

 

 

 
In this illusion, it seems like they are flying, overlooking the entire Garan continent from above.
 

 

 

 
The continent starts with only animals and birds, but soon, human civilization emerges.
 

 

 

 
This is the perspective of the gods.
 

 

 

 
The viewing experience is so thrilling that Song Wanzhuo forgets he came to see his "wife." He is so excited that he can’t stop praising Shi Qianqiu, calling him the god of money-burning aesthetics.
 

 

 

 
So entering the Dark Flower Forest is like playing a simulation game from a god's perspective?
 

 

 

 
The main group witnesses the divine battle between two gods, and Song Wanzhuo, who bought the Dion perspective, feels emotionally charged. He wants to fight with the dark faction for 300 rounds. Dion feels the same way. He is a devout believer and has already made a vow in his heart that as long as he is alive, he will protect the Temple of Light with his life and never let the Dark God invade the capital again.
 

 

 

 
Iya says nothing but looks at him gently, her eyes filled with pity and affection.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang’s heart stirs.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, however, is too caught up in the moment, floating on pink bubbles as he’s gazed at by the goddess: "I can’t handle this, I’m so smitten by the goddess, Jiang Dang, react to this!"
 

 

 

 
"What kind of reaction...?"
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang looks a little dazed. After hesitating, he says, "It feels a bit like ‘Alice in Wonderland’."
 

 

 

 
Facing the conflict in the history of divine wars, the male protagonist unhesitatingly stands on the side of the God of Light.
 

 

 

 
In the "illusion," they arrive at the center of the Sea of Time and witness the scene of two gods negotiating. Though it is just a lingering illusion, the immense presence of these gods still carries an overwhelming pressure. The sun slowly rises from the east, and a golden line stretches along the horizon. Iya, seemingly unaffected by the divine pressure, walks lightly on the water’s surface as though she were an ant.
 

 

 

 
From the public perspective, the scene appears expansive, with Iya positioned between the two gods.
 

 

 

 
From Dion’s perspective…
 

 

 

 
He only saw the girl’s ethereal, elf-like beauty, and his heart felt as sweet as honey. Amidst the stunning visual spectacle, he could see only her, and his gaze was entirely captivated by her.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya turned around and flashed him a brilliant smile.
 

 

 

 
"Dion,"
 

 

 

 
"Is this what a god looks like?"
 

 

 

 
If falling in love had a sound, it must be the saint’s call of his name.
 

 

 

 
Up to this point, the movie was all sweetness.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, a fan of the boyfriend character, was completely swept up in the sweetness. He imagined that his relationship with Tong Zhao should be like this—she is certainly capable, but he could also be her great hero in her world, saving the Galan continent. Though it seemed a bit cliché, what young person hasn’t dreamed of that? Becoming a great hero and embracing a beautiful woman.
 

 

 

 
The illusion’s mystery was solved, and they found the way to the Dark God’s temple.
 

 

 

 
They had to offer the heart of a believer of light to enter.
 

 

 

 
At this point, the audience finally let out a relieved breath.
 

 

 

 
In a Shi Qianqiu movie, if things aren’t stirring up some trouble, it’s just not right.
 

 

 

 
Wasn’t ‘Heartless Tribulation’ like that? It set up a trap for the protagonist.
 

 

 

 
"Hehe, the knife from Shi the Old Thief is finally here," Song Wanzhuo said with confidence, having seen ‘Heartless Tribulation’ before. "With little Sister Xiao Zhao here, what trap can’t she break? Can her subconscious be stopped?"
 

 

 

 
After attempting and failing to force his way through the door, before Iya could speak, Dion boldly volunteered to dig out his own heart. This greatly increased his appeal to many audience members who loved the innocent, big-hearted boy type.
 

 

 

 
— "No, I won’t let you sacrifice yourself."
 

 

 

 
Iya shook her head, still looking as fragile and beautiful as ever.
 

 

 

 
Her voice was clear and melodious, and anyone watching at this point would think she was about to sacrifice herself. The supporting character, Norence, who had initially held some prejudice against her, now felt deeply moved and ashamed, realizing how high the saint's level of self-awareness was.
 

 

 

 
Accompanied by solemn and heavy music, the audience remained calm, confident that Tong Zhao’s subconscious would find a way.
 

 

 

 
No director can ever outdo her!
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu surely values her ability to break through obstacles, right?
 

 

 

 
Haha, they think they can hurt us? No way.
 

 

 

 
We’re just waiting for Tong Zhao’s comeback. Ah, but the atmosphere is so touching; Dion and Iya make such a sweet couple…
 

 

 

 
The next moment, the music abruptly stopped.
 

 

 

 
— "Isn't there a ready one here?"
 

 

 

 
Iya asked in confusion, her voice as pure and innocent as always.
 

 

 

 
After being assigned to the role of the saint-in-training, these orphaned girls were well-protected and rarely seen by outsiders. As a result, Iya always appeared naive and innocent, unaware of the ways of the world. Norence had always found this trait annoying, thinking that Iya didn't understand the hardships of the world, which made her seem pretentious and annoying, almost like an out-of-touch princess.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya reached out with an empty hand—
 

 

 

 
‘Puff’.
 

 

 

 
A small, still-beating red heart appeared in her snow-white, delicate hand.
 

 

 

 
Before Norence could ask why, she stared at Iya in shock.
 

 

 

 
Just like the countless audience members, she was bewildered and unable to comprehend what was happening, her breath halting in fear and despair as she collapsed in the mud.
 

 

 

 
The audience wondered, ‘Is Tong Zhao breaking character?’ From her subconscious performance in ‘One Life Survivor', it’s possible she could make a move like this—sacrificing her teammates with the knife. With her somewhat indifferent sense of good and evil, she didn’t seem to be a good fit for the character of Iya…
 

 

 

 
As these thoughts raced through their minds, Iya placed the still-dripping heart in the center of the door.
 

 

 

 
"Do you know why only those who maintain a devout faith in the God of Light can enter the Flowering Fog Forest? Because the key to open the temple is the heart of the faithful," Iya continued softly, without any background music. Her enchanting voice was more captivating than any melody: "I didn’t want you to be the sacrifice..."
 

 

 

 
Dion finally understood.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, he still didn’t believe Iya was a bad person. He thought she had killed to protect him. He lifted his teammate’s body and moved it aside, so it wouldn’t be swallowed by the mud. Then he hurriedly chased after Iya to question her.
 

 

 

 
The interior of the Dark God’s temple was complex, but the Saintess seemed as though she had returned home.
 

 

 

 
"Protect you? No," 
 

 

 

 
Iya glanced at him in surprise, almost finding it amusing. "For someone like you, it must hurt more for your teammates to sacrifice themselves for you than for you to sacrifice yourself, right? For Norence, she values her life above all. Even if she considers you a friend, she would rather be the one who survives when it comes to choosing between the two of you."
 

 

 

 
Under Dion’s frantic gaze, he saw the bloodstained hem of her white dress.
 

 

 

 
She was still beautiful, breathtakingly so.
 

 

 

 
But now, he couldn’t understand her anymore.
 

 

 

 
Iya’s tone was light and ethereal, and even her voice seemed to echo in the vast temple. "Seeing her desire to live like this, I just want her to die.”
 

 

 

 
At this moment, even the audience who had the most faith in Tong Zhao knew something was off.
 

 

 

 
However, the pacing of this scene was very fast, not giving the audience any time to pause and think. Iya entered the temple, activated the magic circle, and accepted the Dark God’s inheritance. At this point, both the male lead and the audience were reminded of what seemed like a dull world-building exposition at the beginning of the film…
 

 

 

 
So, the trap was buried here?
 

 

 

 
Turns out, this handsome guy betrayed the revolution?
 

 

 

 
Iya showed him the perspective of the Dark God’s war.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, the audience thought:
 

 

 

 
Hmm, there’s a twist. The Dark God is actually a good guy, with his own reasons.
 

 

 

 
Did Shi Qianqiu really think he could fool the audience?
 

 

 

 
The Dark God is indeed the embodiment of evil, with no redeeming qualities.
 

 

 

 
However, a hundred years ago, the Dark God no longer existed on the continent of Galan.
 

 

 

 
The God of Light had long since abandoned its followers.
 

 

 

 
The Red Moon's arrival was a scheme orchestrated by the Church to summon dark creatures, causing widespread devastation, all to intimidate the king and make him obedient to the Pope and the Church.
 

 

 

 
— "Since both the guards and the ones worshiping are false gods who love to cause disasters, why not just worship me?"
 

 

 

 
— "I am the new god of the Galan continent."
 

 

 

 
— "And I will be your only faith."
 

 

 

 
The Saintess, now with the Dark God's inheritance, wore a white gown that instantly turned black, like ink wrapping around her delicate, snow-white figure. Her logic was easy to understand: the Church had always been creating "natural disasters" to secure their position, right? Well, she would give them exactly what they wanted. The real Dark God arrived with the Red Moon, and now it’s time to kneel and worship her!
 

 

 

 
Dion was confused.
 

 

 

 
Of course, at this point, the movie was only halfway through.
 

 

 

 
The audience could tell from the runtime that there was still time left for a comeback and reversal.
 

 

 

 
Iya let him go, allowing him to safely return to the capital with Norence’s body.
 

 

 

 
Along with him came the news of the Dark God’s arrival on the Galan continent. Inside the Church, everything seemed calm. They thought their "false appearance" had succeeded, until dark creatures attacked on a scale far beyond their expectations, and they realized they had overplayed their hand.
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu truly had a great eye for talent.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, the little friend, is a righteous companion with an unprecedented sense of duty. He believes that since he has learned the truth, he has an obligation to correct the wrongs. With such a strong sense of justice, it's a waste of talent if he doesn't do some quick transmigration. After a series of struggles, the truth of the Church's deceitful actions was revealed by the male lead, but even though the former Dark God was fake, the current Dark Saintess is real!
 

 

 

 
The birth of the Dark God means endless war and suffering.
 

 

 

 
The responsibility to slay the gods once again falls on the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Iya, who has just received the inheritance, is not yet at the strength of a god. She only has the ability to summon dark creatures. All they need to do is find her and figure out a way to kill her. The male lead shoulders the hope of the entire capital, but all the audience who bought the immersive experience knows that he is still in love with her.
 

 

 

 
He doesn't even want to win; he'd rather die at her hands.
 

 

 

 
But his sense of justice drives him to give everything he has, without holding back.
 

 

 

 
The movie is a commercial film, and Shi Qianqiu is always good at delivering on the "satisfaction" aspect.
 

 

 

 
After overcoming many hardships, the male lead arrived at the site of the ultimate battle—according to the literature he had found and deciphered, it was best to rest at the place where the old gods' aura was the strongest after receiving the divine inheritance. Thus, he found the center of the Sea of Time, the place where the two gods had departed…
 

 

 

 
This is the first time he had truly reached the core of the Sea of Time.
 

 

 

 
The last time was only in an illusion.
 

 

 

 
Countless audience members, along with Dion, saw his beloved.
 

 

 

 
Iya took the red crescent moon from the sky and used it as a seat, resting her long legs on the tail of the red moon. It glowed with a cold light, casting her pale white skin like snow. Her platinum blonde curls fell across her small, rounded shoulders, and when she heard the sound, she turned around and smiled:
 

 

 

 
“You really came.”
 

 

 

 
This scene was not designed by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 

 

 
He has good taste, but he never expected her to be so bold as to take the moon and use it as a mount.
 

 

 

 
This was a habit Iya had developed over the long years.
 

 

 

 
The heavens, earth, sun, and moon were all at her disposal.
 

 

 

 
This is bad.
 

 

 

 
Both the male lead and Jiang Dang thought to themselves.
 

 

 

 
It seems like he's fallen in love with her again.
# Chapter131
The final battle was the most intense scene for the entire crew to film.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had arranged the counterattack mechanism for the male lead.
 

 
The problem was, his opponent was Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was ‘Tong Zhao’, after all!
 

 
In a system that was well-developed and logically complete, her subconscious, even in the face of adversity, often found a way to survive. How could she be turned over in a situation where her side had such a strong advantage? Even someone as harsh as Shi Qianqiu had to arrange some powerful artifacts for the male lead, such as the divine sword ‘Twilight of the Gods’, and added one more setting...
 

 
The reason why the dark creatures increased in number and became so powerful when the red moon rose was because the Dark God had bestowed part of his divine power on his followers, creating a situation where they appeared strong on the outside but were weak on the inside.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu did everything he could to weaken Iya and strengthen the male lead.
 

 
Despite all the hidden operations, Shi Qianqiu still couldn't rest easy.
 

 
It would be easy to let Tong Zhao win.
 

 
But making her lose? That would be almost impossible.
 

 
The male lead's weapon was a sword that could fulfill every boy's fantasy, glowing with a faint light. The holy knight walked forward, his armor still shining white. And Iya? She jumped down from the red moon, her toes barely touching the water's surface. Was she going to summon a divine artifact out of thin air?
 

 
While the audience was pondering, Iya bent down, and her slender waist caught everyone's attention.
 

 
Including the male lead's.
 

 
With graceful movements, she reached into the water, grasping the reflection of the "Red Moon" on the surface. She pulled out the shadow of the moon from the sea, and a scarlet sickle, dripping with cold seawater, appeared in her hand. It looked like a death god harvesting the lives of everything.
 

 
"Shit! So that wasn't just a reflection?"
 

 
"No way! I need to buy the video and watch this closely. It was clearly a shadow!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was mesmerized.
 

 
He was a typical member of the movie audience—someone whose primary expectation was that the plot made sense. He came to watch the special effects, and he was easily captivated by imaginative and breathtaking visuals. It's easy to please him. As he excitedly watched the screen burning through the budget with impressive scenes, he wondered how the male lead would manage to turn the tables, given the huge gap in strength between the two sides.
 

 
Earlier in the story, it had been established that the male lead wasn't fighting alone. He had teammates from the capital, and they were splitting up to find a way to break the deadlock at the Dark God Temple in the Flowering Forest, while he sought out the core of the conflict on his own.
 

 
This was a very traditional commercial movie trope.
 

 
Unlike the antagonist, the protagonist is distinguished by their strong sense of teamwork. But when it comes to the critical moment, it’s the protagonist who must defeat the opponent personally, with teammates playing a supporting role. Shi Qianqiu was well-versed in this, and he never made a mistake with the pacing.
 

 
Before the "betrayal," Iya was quiet and always appeared serene and beautiful.
 

 
But after her "dark turn"...
 

 
"Since you have to have faith, why not believe in me?"
 

 
"True arrogance lies in making others repent. Why is the path you choose the right one, and mine wrong? The Dark God is the ultimate faith of the entire continent. The church created the dark creatures and sparked wars to seize power. Doesn’t that align perfectly with our teachings?"
 

 
The lavish special effects produced by Shi Qianqiu dazzled on the screen. The female lead, Iya, with her graceful yet imposing presence, managed to hold her own even in a scene dominated by explosive battle effects. In fact, it left the audience feeling overwhelmed, and those who purchased the immersive experience felt they definitely got their money's worth. They could strongly empathize with the male lead's intense admiration and internal struggle for her—this was an experience unique to holographic films! It was like the 3D experience of ‘Avatar’ back in the day. No bootleg could shake its box office dominance. Why? Because it was a movie you couldn’t experience at home; you had to go to the best Lam IMAX theater to fully appreciate the visual effects...
 

 
This gave the audience a compelling reason to go to the cinema.
 

 
With this kind of special experience, who would have trouble convincing the audience to open their wallets?
 

 
If you wanted to see such an explosive scene and the goddess portrayed by Tong Zhao, you had to go to the cinema!
 

 
Every critic who went to see this movie had to admit that Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu were the true power duo.
 

 
Imagine if another actress had been cast instead; she would have been overshadowed by Shi Qianqiu’s aesthetic dominance and relegated to a secondary role. Such dazzling special effects would steal the audience’s attention. Just like the actor who played the male lead, Sun Sa, despite his impressive performance and effort, he couldn’t help but fall into the background during this climactic moment, becoming a mere tool for the plot.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was different.
 

 
It is hard to explain in words, but in the holographic world, Tong Zhao was so naturally perfect for her role, it felt as if she was always meant to be a deity. She perfectly integrated into the character's setting, with the skills and effects of the heavens, earth, sun, and moon only serving as accessories to enhance her. The audience continued to focus on her, placing their attention on her no matter what.
 

 
As the audience and Dion were immersed in the grand scene, Iya spread her arms and cheerfully said:
 

 
"Try your best to please me."
 

 
...
 

 
The male lead didn't start out with the intention to kill. He tried to persuade Iya, telling her that the church's atrocities had been exposed and the king would not let them go. In fact, the capital was in chaos, the pope would not end up well, and as long as she stopped commanding the dark creatures to torment the people...
 

 
"From the moment I accepted the Dark God's inheritance, I was destined to commit evil. Asking me to stop is like asking a fish to leave the water, asking for no breath, or asking the sun to no longer rise in the east."
 

 
Iya smiled, her delicate face glowing with a divine golden halo as she stood against the light:
 

 
"The capital is in chaos, but what about those suffering saintesses? They were once stakes in a gamble, cannon fodder, playthings—did anyone care about them? The church has no innocent members, not even me. I couldn't save anyone from the hell the church built, but now I am the ruler of this hell, and it's my turn to set the rules."
 

 
The two of them fought for a long time.
 

 
But from the audience's perspective, everything happened very quickly.
 

 
The entire Garan continent followed Diya's wishes. When the Red Moon descended, the dark creatures fiercely invaded the capital, causing countless casualties. The once-protective temples became primary targets for attacks. Everyone knew that the church had been intentionally summoning dark creatures all along, even transforming discarded saintesses into dark creatures using secret rituals. Now, however, things had backfired—this creation had turned on them.
 

 
The God of Light did not respond to the prayers of its followers.
 

 
From the perspective of ordinary people, it seemed that the Dark God wasn’t as “greedy” as they thought. After all, wasn't it the church that liked to keep summoning? The artificial Red Moon descending? If you enjoy playing so much, fine, I’m here now—let’s see if you can handle it.
 

 
No one could handle it.
 

 
The people's complaints boiled over as the once-sacred capital temple was shattered into pieces, and there was hope that someone would come forward to clean up the mess.
 

 
At this point, Shi Qianqiu used the camera to its fullest effect. Even the audience who chose the immersive viewing experience could still feel the world that the heroine, Iya, summoned, and from the perspective of a god, things appeared distant and detached. Human life seemed so small, almost negligible.
 

 
There is a difference between humans and gods. Dion could not be so high and mighty. He still felt pity and guilt for the loss of life.
 

 
The sound effects of the holographic filming were explosive, with the dialogue at the climax of the final battle resonating in every viewer’s ears.
 

 
—Iya said, "This is your weakness."
 

 
—Dion replied, "But it also makes me strong."
 

 
Without suspense, the protagonist emerged victorious.
 

 
The victor did not feel triumphant. He was momentarily confused, then showed a look of puzzlement. Everything had happened so quickly. His god-slaying deeds were somehow synchronized and displayed in the sky above the continent of Galan, and everyone witnessed his greatness. They believed he had resolved the incident. Although he did not attain godhood, he was elevated to the same level.
 

 
The two gods had departed, and the people still needed faith.
 

 
Thus, Dion, who had defeated the great villain, was revered as the new Pope.
 

 
The Red Moon ended early.
 

 
Everyone celebrated the Dark God’s defeat by the new Pope, and the old sins were cleansed. The king was deeply grateful to Dion.
 

 
No one noticed that the once bright, shining sword of the new Pope had become entwined with a streak of red, and the cheerful, smiling Dion had not shown a smile ever since.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s cinematic portrayal was always rich in detail, providing the audience with the pleasure of solving puzzles, yet never so obscure that only after the movie ended would they need to read reviews to understand it fully. If that happened, it would mean the director failed—while it’s good for the audience to find deeper meaning in reviews, if they can’t understand the movie without them, it means the director needs to improve in storytelling and cinematography.
 

 
The audience’s perspective revealed something.
 

 
Iya had intentionally let him off the hook, even creating a situation that pushed him to a high position.
 

 
The sins of the old church had to be erased, and she also had a grudge against the continent of Galan. She exposed all the truths that needed to be revealed, and dying by his hands was the best ending.
 

 
Dion had passed her test.
 

 
As Iya had observed, he embodied the most traditional knightly spirit—he was a person of noble character, both wise and brave.
 

 
...
 

 
"After watching the movie, all I want to say is, did you see the Time Sea in the final battle? That’s where Iya let the protagonist off the hook."
 

 
"No, those are just the tears that flowed from my eyes."
 

 
"Old thief Shi, die!!"
 

 
"The goddess I loved was fake, but let’s discuss rationally—did Iya really love Dion?"
 

 
...
 

 
Many who hadn’t bought the immersive experience due to its high price struggled for a while after removing their helmets, only to end up purchasing the expensive tickets.
 

 
And many core fans, who weren’t short on money and were still left wanting more, decided to watch it again.
 

 
When buying tickets for a second viewing, they suddenly realized...
 

 
They could actually choose to view the film from Iya’s perspective in the immersive experience?
 

 
Wait, they could even unlock hidden perspectives in the second round??
 

 
As the audience thought about it, they immediately understood everything.
 

 
If the first viewing was from Iya's perspective, there would be no "surprise" twist. Watching from Dion's perspective would provide the best experience, just like the first viewing.
 

 
Originally, the audience was already satisfied after watching it once, but now, with the new perspective from the female protagonist...
 

 
Four big words appeared in their minds:
 

 
"Tears for the second viewing."
 

 
Tong Zhao also went to watch it.
 

 
She went with her friends from Zeshan, and the rich young man from the group, Wei, booked the whole theater. The friends chatted freely without worrying about disturbing others.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao didn't join in the conversation.
 

 
She was busy interacting with her sister, the Saintess.
 

 
When the movie reached the part where the female protagonist was about to let Dion off the hook...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Ah, so this is the Iya sister who is pure evil and wants the world to end?]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Consort Chen: [No way, no way, no one would do good deeds under the flag of a villain, right? I could do better—I'd immediately gather three thousand male concubines to serve this goddess, and the continent of Galan would instantly become a female-dominant world.]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [How should I put this?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [The female bodhisattva is actually me?]
 

 
The Saintess sister was so angry that she crushed the eyeball embedded in the scepter's head with one hand.
 

 
Instinctive cinema reflects the truest subconscious.
 

 
Iya said she was absolutely evil.
 

 
Zhao Zai peeked out: [Is this being tsundere?]
 

 
...
 

 
The damage wasn’t great, but the insult was extremely strong.
# Chapter132
Inside the Palace of Consciousness:
 

 
Iya: "How much is the box office?"
 

 
Each persona has their own individual room, and Iya, who would normally shut herself in and ignore everyone, has been spending more time in the living room after ‘The Iya Myth’ was released, rarely returning to her room. Consort Chen, who loves to watch the drama, asked her: "Didn’t the Saintess say she doesn't care?"
 

 
Iya: "......"
 

 
Duan Ge: "She wants to know how many people saw her journey."
 

 
For the audience who purchased the immersive viewing experience and chose Iya's perspective, they can feel Iya’s every action, and the motivations behind them… Some anime fans can write thousands of words about a character's actions, just to analyze the character’s motivation. However, unless officially recognized, these analyses usually remain unconfirmed.
 

 
Person A thinks the protagonist eats because they’re hungry. Person B thinks the protagonist eats to start a conversation with another character.
 

 
Don't ask, just know they've shipped it.
 

 
Anyway, the official side usually doesn't comment.
 

 
In the case of ‘The Iya Myth’, the question is whether the villain intentionally let Dion win or if she truly couldn’t be beaten.
 

 
With immersive viewing, there’s no ambiguity. Every audience member can clearly feel that Iya knew the truth behind the Saintess selection and the two gods. From the very beginning of the film, she was determined to martyr herself—only by gaining the power to challenge the vast force of the Light Church could she walk a dangerous path, fully aware that the deeper her connection with the Dark God, the more her mind would be influenced.
 

 
By the latter half of the film, Iya was struggling against her own survival instincts, only thinking about how to die with meaning. Death was not something to fear.
 

 
Immersive viewing was incredibly engaging, but even with regular holographic viewing, the audience could still feel Iya's allure, moved to tears.
 

 
It was truly hard to come to terms with.
 

 
After watching the movie, fans couldn't help but wonder if there was a possibility of a happy ending—since Iya is so good and Dion loves her so much, why couldn't there be a "prince and princess live happily ever after" conclusion?
 

 
Good people deserve a good ending, which is what most of the audience feels.
 

 
Iya is a good person, with no flaws.
 

 
Dion is also a good kid.
 

 
So where's the problem?
 

 
After much thought, the audience finally reached a unified conclusion—
 

 
"The source of all evil, Shi Qianqiu—who supports and who opposes?"
 

 
[I declare that Shi Qianqiu is the real villain!]
 

 
[I declare your declaration is valid.]
 

 
[The Saintess Sister is not only kind-hearted, but also super kind, but Shi Qianqiu really has no heart!!!]
 

 
Recently, Tong Zhao has developed an unexpected love for browsing the internet and reading movie reviews.
 

 
Her agent was quite surprised, saying that she didn't realize she enjoyed reading praise about herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled: "Of course!"
 

 
Iya held her head: "Stop reading it..."
 

 
Consort Chen, with an opera-like tone, sweetly read out the reviews: "How could the Saintess Sister be absolutely evil? She's clearly too kind! Just thinking about how she was heading for martyrdom from the start makes me feel sorry for her. Iya is a little angel!"
 

 
The cute ending of the word ‘ba’ (a cute tone) was drawn out in an adorable loli voice.
 

 
Duan Ge had a hard time holding back his laughter.
 

 
Consort Chen really knows how to make people uncomfortable.
 

 
Elder Lu patted Iya on the shoulder, and everything was silently understood.
 

 
After Tong Zhao made slight adaptations to Iya's experiences and turned them into a script, almost all the critics felt that she wasn't a bad person. She was inherently kind, and her actions had never been wrong. The only bad thing was Shi Qianqiu, the director. When Consort Chen read the third review aloud, Iya couldn't take it anymore and retreated to her room.
 

 
Elder Lu: "Stop always bullying her."
 

 
Consort Chen: "When the disease is severe, you have to use strong medicine. The child spends all day fantasizing that she's the irredeemable villain—she's probably just craving compliments."
 

 
Tong Zhao could only laugh and say "hahaha."
 

 
The movie was titled ‘Iya Myth’, but for ordinary people and those in the entertainment industry who didn't understand the full story, this was just another box office success created by Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu. Wherever they went, they were living, breathing box office machines.
 

 
Thanks to ‘Iya Myth’'s excellent box office performance, its screenings in real-world theaters also increased significantly. In the era of immersive cinema, audiences with helmets or capsules could enjoy watching movies at home, but what they came to the theaters for was the interactive experience, especially those who purchased the "immersive viewing" experience.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ breaks another box office record on opening day, with a single-day peak reaching..."
 

 
"Box office slump reversed? Reviews exploded? Tong Zhao continues her undefeated legend."
 

 
"What's the secret to ‘Iya Myth’'s success? Could immersive viewing be the new wealth code?"
 

 
From the script's perspective, ‘Iya Myth’ wasn't a particularly complicated story.
 

 
If you're asking how deep it is, not really.
 

 
At least Shi Qianqiu never thought about winning the Best Script Award; he only submitted for Best Special Effects and Best Actress.
 

 
When he gave an interview, he straightforwardly said: "The script was written by Tong Zhao. She was interested in the story, so okay, I accompanied her to film it and helped her come up with ways to make the movie interesting and profitable. We didn’t aim to explore profound human nature; we just wanted to give the audience a unique fantasy journey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu's logic was always this simple and blunt.
 

 
He made movies boldly, but his ideas were very practical. His goal was to serve the audience, to create blockbuster films that everyone would love to watch and that could make money. This director, who was the least short on funds in the industry, was often the one who earned the most. One could only sigh and think, "The rich get richer."
 

 
As the audience's positive impression of him increased due to this approach, Shi Qianqiu added a piece of behind-the-scenes information: "The red smoke on the holy sword of Dion is actually the shattered soul of Iya. Why is it shattered? Haha, because the male lead killed her with his own hands."
 

 
The host paused for a moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "Hey, fans, don’t cry. Let me give you some candy. They loved each other, they liked each other."
 

 
He looked into the camera, his tone sincere.
 

 
Immediately, the screen was filled with a barrage of question marks.
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Just when I started to like him a little…]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu, are you even human?! I feel like he's stuffing a knife into my mouth while asking, "Isn't this candy sweet? How sweet is it?" But all I taste is rust...]
 

 
All the hatred was redirected to the director.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, the audience's affection for Iya's character was transferred to her.
 

 
To the audience, Tong Zhao was the Saintess herself.
 

 
If she didn’t have such a gentle and kind subconscious, could she have portrayed such a great character? No, she couldn’t have. Netizens believed this too, thinking she was especially good.
 

 
This made Tong Zhao feel a little embarrassed.
 

 
Thanks to its strong box office performance, the movie stayed in theaters for a long time before it finally ended its run.
 

 
Fans counted on their fingers, knowing that the awards season was coming. Even if they didn’t win an award, getting a nomination would be great.
# Chapter133
Upon arriving at the neighboring city, it was 2 p.m.
 

 
Tong Zhao always tried to keep her travels as low-key as possible. She didn’t need to show off her popularity by having fans brave the cold wind to pick her up. In fact, she would be bothered by it. Out of consideration for not making things harder for security, she would try her best not to acknowledge the fans on-site, walking quickly and expressionlessly under the escort of security.
 

 
After all, if the fans got too excited and were pushed around, it would be the security personnel who would be in discomfort.
 

 
But thinking about how the fans had come all the way there only to be ignored also made Tong Zhao feel bad.
 

 
The best outcome would be if no one came to pick her up.
 

 
With Tong Zhao’s insistence, the team was strict about security, and occasionally, paparazzi would snap pictures of her not being picked up by any fans at the airport. Fans felt deeply sorry for her, thinking she was being neglected in her own city. But in reality, she was quite happy about it. However, even when explained, some younger fans refused to believe it.
 

 
They insisted it was the company’s fault, that she couldn’t speak out about the truth.
 

 
When their sister said not to let them, would they really just comply?
 

 
Do they still love their sister?
 

 
Faced with such devotion, Tong Zhao could only try her best to do her job well.
 

 
“I wonder if any fans are here to pick me up…”
 

 
“You don’t need to think about it. Of course there are,” her round-faced assistant shattered her little illusion. “Xiao Zhao, the news about your nomination for the Huaying Awards is everywhere. This is such a clear schedule, it’s so easy for fans to catch you. Don’t underestimate them!”
 

 
Tong Zhao would never underestimate her fans.
 

 
Since her popularity had skyrocketed, in addition to the fans who simply admired her, there were also paparazzi and related people who came looking for profit.
 

 
Her schedule, her privacy, her photos—all of it could be sold for a high price…
 

 
As the team chatted easily, they disembarked, and sure enough, Tong Zhao could already see a sea of people waiting from afar.
 

 
She was suddenly moved: "Iya, your turn."
 

 
Iya: "Why? I'm not interested..."
 

 
Before she could finish, she was pushed into action.
 

 
After all, the main personality still had more authority.
 

 
Although when asked, Iya would usually respond with a question: "Why should I help?" However, when the responsibility was put on her, she would still stiffen her face and get it done.
 

 
Some keen-eyed people, upon seeing the target through the VIP channel, quickly turned their faces toward her. Every one of their eyes sparkled with excitement and expectation, looking at Iya with longing and admiration. Due to the airport's order, the fans didn’t dare to make too much noise; they could only express their love by holding up banners and signs—
 

 
“Zhao Zai, Mommy loves you!”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Showstopper!”
 

 
“Protect the world’s best little angel Iya!”
 

 
...
 

 
When Iya saw the third banner, her face darkened, and she averted her gaze.
 

 
The countless flashes from cameras formed a shimmering fog of light around her, making her already beautiful face look almost distorted in the halo of attention.
 

 
Her assistant had once joked that she had a divine aura.
 

 
Wasn't that true? She already had the aura of a goddess on her way out.
 

 
Finally, they spotted Tong Zhao! The fans were trying to contain their excitement, their faces flushed with joy. They whispered to their companions, sharing their impressions of seeing the star in person—“She looks a bit thinner than in the photos. Her long hair is like a cloud. She walks through the airport’s VIP channel like she’s stepping onto a red carpet, distant and natural.”
 

 
If she were an ordinary small celebrity, some fans might feel disappointed and think she was being too pretentious.
 

 
But this is Tong Zhao!
 

 
Just think about the news reports and the well-known box office achievements, Tong Zhao has the capital to be proud.
 

 
In fact, many fans actually love this superstar vibe she gives off.
 

 
Some enthusiastic, wealthy, and idle fans who have seen her in person many times lamented, “Zhao Zhao looks a little different today. She’s usually quite friendly with fans, and smiles at us. But today, she’s not smiling. However, she looks like...”
 

 
“Looks like what?”
 

 
“Is she a bit shy?”
 

 
Iya, with her keen hearing, couldn't help but cast a warning glance when she overheard this.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes, with a light hue, were misty with a subtle, entrancing look.
 

 
It was enough to steal one's soul at a glance.
 

 
The fan, who had been speaking casually, let out a short, sharp scream, electrified and speechless, overwhelmed with affection for "Sister," bending like a mosquito coil. Iya's moment of hesitation quickly disappeared, and she returned her gaze, adopting the attitude of ignoring these foolish mortals with cool detachment.
 

 
Iya heard very clearly.
 

 
Many people were saying they liked her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Hey, look, doesn't Tong Zhao's ears look a bit red?"
 

 
"Even though she didn’t say anything, I know she's still happy to see us!"
 

 
"The shy sister is just too cute!!!”
 

 
Once the fans noticed this, they got even more excited. Many airport photos were leaked, and even though the retouched ones hadn't been released yet, raw photos were already circulating with each person having their own copy. Her face was too stunning—there were no flaws. No matter how bad their photography skills were, they couldn’t go wrong—every random shot turned out beautiful. What's more, since Tong Zhao debuted, there has never been a truly unflattering photo of her. Even when people who dislike her try to spread hate, they can only post photos of her with a cold, aloof expression, accusing her of being pretentious and arrogant.
 

 
Despite the fans’ enthusiasm, "Tong Zhao" quickly jumped into the chauffeur-driven car and disappeared from view…
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao fasten her seatbelt, the assistant closed their eyes, assuming she hadn’t rested well on the plane and didn’t want to disturb her. Iya took her place, retreating to her room to be alone.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, regaining control of her body.
 

 
Ever since she exposed Iya’s "tsundere" persona, Iya had grown more self-destructive about maintaining that image.
 

 
...
 

 
The Huaying Awards were live-streamed across the internet.
 

 
Tong Zhao came with the crew of ‘Iya Myth’. Sun Sa had already emerged from his gloomy period—he was lucky, having joined the fast track with Shi and Tong early on, and throughout filming, he received shock therapy from the seasoned director, Shi Laoze. He had shed his college boy innocence and had grown into a mature man who could stand beside Tong Zhao, not necessarily a perfect match, but at least a man worthy of being her partner for a day.
 

 
The moment they stepped out of the car, they were engulfed by a sea of flashing cameras.
 

 
Sun Sa, who had been warned in advance, maintained his composure, though his stiff expression looked slightly forced.
 

 
Beside him, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of the Empress, outshining the entire scene. Despite the blinding lights, she maintained a composed smile. Her beauty was flawless, standing up to any angle. To meet the expectations of the fans, she wore a platinum-colored gown today, echoing the look of her nominated character, Iya.
 

 
Under the influence of her aura, Tong Zhao walked in real life with the effect of a movie scene. All the viewers watching the live broadcast and the fans on-site couldn’t help but hold their breath. Some fans couldn’t control themselves and shouted her name, hoping to catch her attention.
 

 
[Wow, she’s so beautiful, it’s like she’s glowing.]
 

 
[Maybe it's her accumulated box office that's glowing /manual dog head.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, I really want to see the scene live! Does she have a good chance of winning?]
 

 
The comments were buzzing with excitement.
 

 
The plot of ‘Iya Myth’ wasn’t particularly profound or complex, and it didn’t delve into social issues. The film had a high chance of winning a visual effects award, and Shi Qianqiu was almost certain to win. However, Best Actress was less certain.
 

 
Since the era of immersive cinema has nothing to do with acting skills, the standard for evaluating actors had become the degree of their standout moments.
 

 
Among this year’s nominees, there wasn’t a clear standout champion; the contenders were evenly matched, and many felt that the Huaying Awards judges should take box office performance into account. ‘Iya Myth’ had phenomenal box office results, and its support for immersive cinema was also a big plus.
 

 
Of course, this was a discussion for those particularly interested in the awards.
 

 
The remaining netizens were discussing more intuitive topics—
 

 
On various discussion forums, countless threads featuring "Tong Zhao" surged. [She and Sun Sa are really a perfect match], [Actually, I think Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu walking the red carpet together would be even better. Sun Sa is a bit weak], [What do you know? A wolfdog with a queen will always be a legend], and [Her dress is so beautiful! It suits her so well, she’s basically a modern-day Iya. I want to buy one just like it…]
 

 
Then the price of the dress posted online made everyone fall silent.
 

 
This gown was a high-end custom piece from a blue-blood brand. Sister Chu didn’t have the connections to get it, but Zeshan and the others knew that Tong Zhao had a great chance of winning and possibly earning her first Best Actress title. They all chipped in to help, with Wei Zekai coordinating everything. Actually, he could afford it alone; compared to the cost of a yacht, it was nothing, but the true value lay in the heartfelt gesture from her good friends.
 

 
The platinum-colored gown was adorned with diamonds, truly luxurious and sparkling, like a goddess draped in stars.
 

 
After a brief interview, the Huaying Awards ceremony officially began. The cameras were fairly distributed, and even Tong Zhao, who was the most popular on-site, couldn’t stay in the spotlight the entire time. However, sharp-eyed viewers quickly noticed that she was sitting between Shi Qianqiu and Sun Sa, which pleased fans supporting both pairings.
 

 
Sitting together, it was almost like they were already "officially registered."
 

 
The ceremony was lengthy, and being a guest at the event was no easy task. Wearing haute couture, one couldn’t afford to relax; you never knew when the camera might be on you. You had to remain focused on watching, and playing on your phone was out of the question...
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had her own way to pass the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "You're really playing your cards well."
 

 
Consoy Chen: "I see two kings, I call it the landlord. That’s called dominance."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Is that why you asked the system to block the synchronization of memory between different personalities?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "A little gambling is just for fun."
 

 
Zhao Zai had been bouncing around at the card table for a while.
 

 
She originally wanted to play too, but then she was scooped up by Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t bored, but the people around her were.
 

 
This was Sun Sa’s first time attending such a grand event, and he was nervous, his mind full of thoughts about how he didn’t deserve to be there. How did he go from his dilapidated dormitory at school to the Huaying Awards ceremony? His film had a good chance of winning, though not Best Picture, but it was still stirring.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he was already tired of this kind of event.
 

 
If it weren’t for the nomination, he wouldn’t have wanted to sit through hours of it.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu glanced at Tong Zhao, who was smiling and lost in thought, and spoke to her, “Are you nervous? You’re about to win your first Best Actress award.”
 

 
“I can only be considered a strong contender,” Tong Zhao replied, both candid and restrained.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stared at the stage and softly said, “Best Picture is impossible because the script is too limited, so the team is mainly focusing on Best Actress. In a few hours, you’ll be the Best Actress. Are you surprised? Excited?”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao also asked softly, “Are you the type who, when someone gets a mystery novel, immediately leans over and says, ‘The murderer is so-and-so’?”
 

 
“Otherwise, you think my brother stopped reading mystery novels for what reason?”
 

 
Life of being spoiled by spoilers.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of sympathy for this brother she had never met.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “So, are you excited or not?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Not excited.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a glance, and indeed, her small face remained calm.
 

 
Tong Zhao reflected for a moment. The first time she quick-travelled, when she became a noble concubine, ascended to immortality, when Han Zhi kept winning awards, and when she inherited the legacy of the Dark God... it seemed like she had gotten used to being excited, and over time, it became more and more mundane. What truly made her smile joyfully were the little details in daily life.
 

 
A camera captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu speaking softly to each other, and the audience thought they were probably discussing the award ceremony. Although Shi Qianqiu's words could be harsh, his analysis of films was often sharp and insightful. He also had a prophetic understanding of the film market. Many viewers who found the award ceremony boring were eager to hear what he and Tong Zhao were talking about, believing it was probably more interesting than the ceremony itself.
 

 
In reality...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "As if nothing happened."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It’s all about effort."
 

 
"Haha," Shi Qianqiu paused. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao tried hard to resist the urge to roll her eyes at him. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
---
 

 
Three minutes later, the two were still caught in a never-ending loop of wordplay over the idiom "do whatever you want.”
# Chapter134: The End of the Main Text
"First Defeat for Tong Zhao!"
 

 
A huge snow-white banner appeared out of nowhere in the consciousness palace, hanging in the middle of the living room.
 

 
What was the "first defeat"?
 

 
It was in the idiom game with Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Rewind the time by one minute—
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly sighed, "Isn’t that enough? I can’t take it anymore!"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Shi Qianqiu turned his head, a faint smile appearing on his clean, scholar-like face. "Can’t take it anymore?"
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow.
 

 
If this were a game, her question mark would already be on the screen.
 

 
The smile in Shi Qianqiu’s eyes deepened. "Do as you wish, can’t take it anymore."
 

 
...
 

 
Another cycle. How many more times?
 

 
Tong Zhao sneered, holding back the urge to curse at him—what if the camera caught her lip movements, and she couldn’t explain it? She decided to stay silent and let him embarrass himself. However, for Shi Qianqiu, embarrassment? Not possible. His skin was as thick as layers of cement. When the camera swept to their side, he still calmly smiled at it, causing a stir in the bullet screen.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is considered one of the better-looking directors.]
 

 
[Actually, he’s pretty good-looking even among male stars…]
 

 
[Don’t talk about it, just thinking about dating him makes me lose interest immediately.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had been in relationships before; his ex-girlfriend was a well-known international model.
 

 
However, his sharp remarks left such a strong impression on netizens that it’s hard to imagine him being involved in a sweet romance—his ex-girlfriend also had a world-weary, high-class look that seemed to scorn everything. When they stood together, they didn’t even need to speak to give off an air of mockery. Despite his handsome appearance, he surprisingly had very few female fans.
 

 
Soon, it was time for the highlight of tonight’s Instinct Film Awards—
 

 
The Best Actress award.
 

 
"In the film, they are the absolute main characters, and tonight, they are also the shining stars of the Huaying Awards. These five ladies are..." The presenter paused, smiling as they announced the first nominee: "Yan Yanghan, ‘The Pisces Incident’."
 

 
As the presenter called out the names, the big screen showed the nominees’ live appearances and stills from their films.
 

 
Tong Zhao was placed last on the list.
 

 
When Tong Zhao appeared on the screen, the audience only saw her nodding slightly at the camera, her cold and elegant expression betraying no hint of nervousness or expectation—true to her usual demeanor at major events. Even her most devoted fans would struggle to recall a time when she seemed nervous, even when she was just starting out. Every time she appeared, her outfit was impeccable, and her attitude graceful and composed.
 

 
"And the Best Actress award goes to—"
 

 
Amidst the heated discussions in the bullet screen, the presenter beamed an excited, sincere smile and called out towards Tong Zhao: "Tong Zhao, ‘Iya Myth!"
 

 
The scene erupted in cheers and applause, giving her a grand reception.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s popularity in the industry wasn’t particularly good or bad. Although she didn’t focus much on networking, her outstanding professional skills had earned her much goodwill. In a high-pressure work environment, a colleague who does their job well and doesn’t cause trouble is naturally treated with kindness. As for her competitors? While other actresses of the same generation may have harbored some resentment towards her, they had to admit that there was no real competition between them anymore.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao's box office success, even though they had to lower their status and invest their own money, the investors would naturally favor this money-making machine.
 

 
What does it feel like for Tong Zhao to be surrounded by applause as she steps onto the stage?
 

 
Consort Chen: "Keep the spotlight on me!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Got it, got it."
 

 
Winning her first Best Actress award felt like a coronation.
 

 
Consort Chen was highly sensitive to such occasions, and she could not afford to make any mistakes. She had to shine brighter than anyone else.
 

 
With the spotlight on her, Tong Zhao walked briskly to the award stage. The lights fell on her, and she was, as expected, the center of attention—though, even without this "golden finger" of a spotlight, she was already stunning under the glow. But with the added radiance, her mortal beauty transformed into something otherworldly, dazzling and captivating, evoking admiration from all.
 

 
[Wow, she's just so beautiful!]
 

 
[She’s been in the industry for so long, and I've probably seen her face a thousand times, but how does she still manage to look even more beautiful each time?]
 

 
[Her dress is glowing—oh my god, it’s diamond-studded—so beautiful, truly well-deserved!]
 

 
[Not going up to accept the award would be an insult to her look.]
 

 
After briefly shaking hands with the presenter, they exchanged a few words of congratulations and pleasantries before handing her the stage to deliver her acceptance speech. Tong Zhao took the Huaying Award trophy from the presenter. It was heavier than she had imagined. Turning to face the concerned faces in the crowd—
 

 
The stage below was full of stars.
 

 
But at this moment, she was the true star of the show.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath.
 

 
In reality, she wasn’t particularly interested in winning the award; she was more focused on the PR capital it brought. She even thought about letting another personality take over and handle it. But even Consort Chen, who loved being in the spotlight, insisted that Tong Zhao take the stage herself. Consort Chen had said at the time: "You might not care now, or you might never care, but this is an important moment in your life, and it can only be claimed by the most complete version of you."
 

 
So, it would be her who took it.
 

 
“I remember not too long ago, I was just a girl who was kicked out of her home and cut off from financial support. ‘Ming Emperor’ was my first—and possibly my last—chance.”
 

 
The PR team had already written her acceptance speech, but when the words reached her lips, she spoke another version.
 

 
The fans on the barrage stopped complimenting her looks, turned off their comments, and chose to silently enjoy this special moment with their idol.
 

 
Tong Zhao had once missed this opportunity.
 

 
To be exact, she had cheated. She had come back from many worlds, honing her skills by conquering them.
 

 
A wave of emotion surged within her, unrelated to the honor of being named Best Actress.
 

 
Maybe it wasn’t about conquering.
 

 
She had come back to save herself.
 

 
“Critics often say I’m difficult to figure out, that they don’t know how to define me. And I often wonder, why should I be defined? I have a diverse subconscious; I don’t want to be fixed in one place. Even if Consort Chen brings me the first Best Actress award, I won’t always use her image in the future.”
 

 
Others didn’t know that she had many personalities; they thought it was just a narrative style.
 

 
Some loved the fierce and cool Duan Ge.
 

 
Some loved the aloof and solitary Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Some love the enchanting Consort Chen...
 

 
At this important moment, Tong Zhao only wanted to confess to herself.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ was a bold challenge for both me and Shi Qianqiu. I asked him: Iya isn’t a traditionally positive character. She has twisted and obsessive traits, both toward others and herself. The box office might not be so optimistic."
 

 
"Director Shi told me: 'It’s okay, you focus on making the audience like her, and I’ll make the audience like the movie.'"
 

 
"I want to thank Director Shi, thank Sun Sa, thank all the staff behind and in front of ‘Iya Myth’, my agent, and every friend from Zeshan. They gave ‘Iya’ a lot of financial support..."
 

 
The consciousness palace was very quiet.
 

 
There were many difficulties walking this path in the human world. Tong Zhao was always strict with herself, always wanting to do better, always striving for perfection. The admiration from her fans and the recognition of the box office made her very satisfied and happy, but at this moment, all she wanted was her own recognition.
 

 
She didn’t need to ask; she already knew her answer.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised the trophy, showing the reporters an impeccable winning smile, and softly said in her heart:
 

 
*Thank you all.*
 

 
The applause was thunderous.

—-----------------
 

 
TN: The main text is over, there are still 8 extra chapters.
# Chapter135: Extras on Love (1) – Shi Qianqiu I Married Tong Zhao...
The night had fallen.
 

 
At the after-party for the Huaying Awards, Tong Zhao was still surrounded by a crowd. Though she maintained a polite social distance, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the circle of people around her was made up of several layers, given the typically reserved and dignified nature of these celebrities. Photographers moved through the crowd, and the flashes of cameras occasionally landed on her expensive dress, making it sparkle and shine.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stood beside her, gallantly blocking drinks for her.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s status, she was never the type of person to be toyed with by the powerful and wealthy. Therefore, the toasts were mostly short and polite, not meant to make her uncomfortable or embarrass her. However, after a while, she remained curious: "I didn’t expect you to have such a good tolerance for alcohol."
 

 
"Drinking is part of the fun," Shi Qianqiu turned his face toward her, flashing a smile. "Anything that’s fun, I’m good at."
 

 
Beneath his refined and cultured appearance was a deep, unfathomable darkness, which made Tong Zhao feel a little uneasy. She turned to Sun Sa and said, "You asked me how I’ve managed to stay true to myself in the entertainment industry before? Just don’t follow his example."
 

 
"Don’t falsely accuse me. I’ve been like this since elementary school—this is what staying true to oneself really looks like."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s words were soft, but it seemed like he sensed something. The smile on his lips deepened, and he gestured to a photographer in the distance. "Come take a photo, maybe give the ‘Shi-Zhao CP’ fans some perks?"
 

 
Tong Zhao found this a little strange.
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu didn’t care much about how others tried to pair him with people for the sake of fanfiction, apart from the last promotional event, he generally didn’t use this kind of thing to hype up his popularity—he found it beneath him.
 

 
What kind of wind was this?
 

 
However, when the photographer smiled and walked over, Tong Zhao still allowed the gesture, as she felt she should give her friend face. Shi Qianqiu casually wrapped his arm around her waist—not actually holding her, just making a show of their close relationship.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled as she flashed a smile at the photographer.
 

 
With a flash of light, the photographer complimented her:
 

 
"Xiao Zhao, you look really beautiful tonight!"
 

 
"The stylist put a lot of effort into it," Tong Zhao said modestly, her expression calm.
 

 
"Your hair is messy."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised his hand and tucked the stray hairs at her temples behind her ear.
 

 
To the onlookers, the two of them seemed incredibly close, their interaction so subtle that it was almost imperceptible.
 

 
As for the feelings of the parties involved… it was rather unsettling.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was pondering why Shi Qianqiu was being so considerate for no apparent reason, the "truth" walked over with a cold face:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, congratulations."
 

 
Wei Zekai had arrived midway through.
 

 
As the main person in charge of Zeshan, his job was just as demanding as Tong Zhao's. He often had to fly around for business trips, and with his father expecting him to inherit the family business, he was always under pressure. He had been delayed by a major business deal and had hurried to the Huaying party…
 

 
But he didn’t really have to rush.
 

 
He could meet Tong Zhao anytime.
 

 
Even if they couldn’t meet in person, he could always get her to answer a video call.
 

 
But after hearing that Tong Zhao had a good chance of winning, Wei Zekai decided to come in person. He was still in the car when the award ceremony was taking place, anxious to get there, and when he finally arrived, he saw the intimate scene between the two from a distance.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mood completely broke down at that moment.
 

 
For the past few days, Wei Zekai had been thinking about his feelings for Tong Zhao.
 

 
He hadn’t figured it out.
 

 
Or maybe he didn’t want to figure it out, fearing that if he did, they might not even be friends anymore.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her head toward Wei Zekai when she heard him speak, and Shi Qianqiu also lifted his gaze to look at him, flashing a provocative smile. Just as Tong Zhao happened to glance back at Shi Qianqiu, Director Shi immediately concealed his challenging expression and put on a refined, gentlemanly demeanor once again.
 

 
All of this was seen clearly by Wei Zekai—he understood it completely—
 

 
This guy really is no good!
 

 
"You’re here," Tong Zhao said, now understanding what Shi Qianqiu’s earlier actions had been about. She couldn’t help but laugh a little. She knew how busy Xiao Kai was, and he had actually managed to make it to the venue. She immediately gave him the second most sincere smile of the night: "You rushed here right after getting off the plane?"
 

 
"I changed clothes."
 

 
It was too rushed. Wei Zekai hadn’t had time to style himself carefully, but his looks were still good enough to carry him through. He wasn’t any less handsome than Sun Sa. Plus, his experience in the business world had given him a more mature aura. He had the vigor of youth, but also the depth of a mature man. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, slightly furrowing his brow. The photographer, who had been about to leave, was delighted to see Wei Zekai and immediately turned back to take another picture.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I’ll be in it too."
 

 
The photographer, of course, didn’t mind.
 

 
With a flash of the camera, the three of them had a group photo.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious but kept his temper in check. Shi Qianqiu noticed that he was jealous and said to the photographer, "Make sure to send me a copy of the photo. It’s so meaningful."
 

 
After the photographer agreed and walked away, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but feel annoyed.
 

 
Meaningful? What a load of nonsense!
 

 
It should have been just him and Tong Zhao in the photo, not him being dragged into it.
 

 
The three of them walked to a quieter corner to talk. Tong Zhao asked him, "Meaningful?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gestured and said, "That group photo—doesn’t it look like the Chinese character 'niao’ (meaning annoyed or angry)? The meaning fits perfectly!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was from Guangdong, and Tong Zhao knew a little Cantonese. In Cantonese, "niao" means "angry," so he was making a pun at Wei Zekai's expense. Wei Zekai didn’t understand, but from the way Shi Qianqiu was talking, it was clear he wasn’t saying anything nice.
 

 
But then, to Tong Zhao’s surprise…
 

 
She seemed to enjoy it!
 

 
Wei Zekai had used Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) before and didn’t understand why some people complained that their partners didn’t notice the "green tea". He couldn’t understand what was so infuriating about it. Now, he completely got it. Shi Qianqiu knew how to use every chance to make Tong Zhao laugh or give him provocative looks whenever she wasn’t looking directly at him. And whenever she noticed, he would immediately switch to looking perfectly composed and self-assured, making Wei Zekai angry but unable to expose it.
 

 
So manipulative!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, the master of "green tea"!
 

 
Just then, someone came up to Tong Zhao to invite her for a group photo. She said, "I’ll be back in a moment."
 

 
That left the two men staring at each other.
 

 
This should have been an awkward scene, but Shi Qianqiu wasn’t bothered. He casually took a sip of champagne, completely at ease.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "The movie we worked on together won her her first Best Actress award."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re childhood sweethearts."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re business partners in Zeshan."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress..." He dragged out the "s" at the end.
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t get it. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, who explained, "Best Actress ‘s’, the plural form. Don’t you know English? I can bring her many Best Actress awards in the future."
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought to himself, no wonder Tong Zhao was so tolerant of him—teasing him was just too fun. He was a lot like his younger brother, though his brother was a bit more obedient and serious. Watching Wei Zekai getting so worked up, unable to come up with a response, was quite amusing. He was curious to see what kind of big move Wei Zekai would come up with.
 

 
After a while, he heard Wei Zekai say:
 

 
"If you're not good to her, I won't let you off the hook."
 

 
...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised an eyebrow, genuinely surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew the two had a close relationship. Given their intimate interaction just now and the subtle aura of a "main wife" Shi Qianqiu was giving off, he had completely misunderstood. Although he didn't think Shi Qianqiu was a good person, as long as Tong Zhao liked him, he trusted her judgment and choices. Even though it felt like his heart was being squeezed, he didn’t try to deny their relationship.
 

 
The light fell on his proud brows and eyes, looking both dejected and defiant—his youthful energy practically radiating from him.
 

 
What is youthful energy, if not loving someone you can't have?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found himself momentarily lost in thought, watching him.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought Shi Qianqiu was silent because he didn’t believe him, so he continued, “Tong Zhao might seem strong, but she hasn’t gone through much hardship. She's actually very delicate. You can’t just assume that because she’s independent, you don’t need to pamper her.” He went on to talk about her picky eating habits, her gaming preferences, and what gifts she liked to receive…
 

 
Forced to listen to his partner’s unsolicited advice, Shi Qianqiu snapped back to reality and said, “Alright, when Tong Zhao and I get married, remember to come be my best man.”
 

 
A huge question mark appeared over Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
“You’re going too far!”
 

 
“Aren’t you good friends? Is it too much to ask you to be my best man?” Shi Qianqiu asked knowingly.
 

 
This left Wei Zekai speechless.
 

 
Yes, what’s the big deal?
 

 
Wei Zekai lowered his gaze slightly, his thoughts slowly becoming clearer.
 

 
But it was too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found his expression so amusing. He had heard that Wei Zekai and his younger brother were good friends, so why didn’t his younger brother invite him over earlier? Ah, it was a case of "better late than never."
 

 
He swirled his wine glass and, with a tone full of feigned sentimentality, said, "Don’t worry, I’ll treat her well."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s acting skills were truly impressive.
 

 
Wei Zekai believed him, feeling both relieved and heartbroken.
 

 
What reassured him was that Shi Qianqiu didn’t seem to be playing with Tong Zhao, that he wasn’t toying with her emotions. What saddened him was that he always felt he could treat Tong Zhao better, but he had arrived too late…
 

 
No, it wasn’t that he was late.
 

 
It was that he realized it a bit too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked, “Aren’t you unwilling to accept this?”
 

 
“A bit,” Wei Zekai muttered. “It’s not your fault. I always thought I had more time with her. I didn’t want to change the status quo. I was afraid that if I changed anything, I might lose her.”
 

 
Familiarity, in love, isn’t always a good thing.
 

 
Although he didn’t fully understand their story, someone as perceptive as Shi Qianqiu had probably figured out most of it from his few words…
 

 
A warm smile curved on the corner of his lips.
 

 
“It’s okay, I’ll treat her well on your behalf.”
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she saw Wei Zekai looking all gloomy and Shi Qianqiu looking particularly pleased.
 

 
She wasn’t sure what had happened, but it was probably something to do with being bullied.
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed, “Don’t bully him.”
 

 
This sweet interaction…
 

 
Wei Zekai felt even more heartbroken hearing that.
 

 
“I didn’t bully him,” Shi Qianqiu replied. “I just think he has a rare youthful energy. I want to invite him to act in my next movie.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was speaking the truth. In the entertainment industry, it was rare to find someone as handsome, with such a noble and youthful aura: “I’m going to take another walk. You two talk. Oh, and by the way, remember to come to my wedding.”
 

 
Wei Zekai almost wanted to curse.
 

 
He glanced at Tong Zhao and held back.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. “He’s getting married?”
 

 
She hadn’t heard that he had a girlfriend.
 

 
Since they’d met, Shi Qianqiu had always been single, and she wasn’t that familiar with Wei Zekai either. So, she couldn’t help but be curious. “Are you going to his wedding? Who is he marrying?”
 

 
As soon as she asked, she saw the look of disbelief on Wei Zekai’s face as he stared at her.
 

 
That look in his eyes was like a little dog that had just been kicked by its owner, utterly stunned.
# Chapter136: Emotional Extra (2) You Need to Wake Up Before I Can Have My Say...
Wei Zekai didn’t want to talk to her and started sulking.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other, like in a game—one signal, and Tong Zhao would know exactly what he meant. It was the same this time. As the party was nearing its end, they had long passed the stage where minor conflicts needed to be addressed on the spot. Tong Zhao decided to wait until they were heading home before discussing it.
 

 
After the party ended, Wei Zekai took a detour and had his driver take a cab back. He shamelessly parked next to Tong Zhao’s chauffeur-driven car, standing there silently.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing. "Let’s send them back. I’ll ride with Xiao Kai."
 

 
Her team members, tight-lipped and not ones to ask many questions, had their curiosity piqued, their eyes lighting up with gossip. Tong Zhao didn’t explain much and climbed into Wei Zekai’s car. Most likely, knowing she’d need a ride home, he didn’t have the driver bring out his flashy sports car today. Instead, he chose a low-key, comfortable business car—sports cars, with their focus on speed and appearance, often sacrificed passenger comfort.
 

 
The car was very quiet.
 

 
The car’s air freshener gave off a faint lemon scent, fresh but not overpowering.
 

 
Tong Zhao changed out of her off-shoulder dress, removed her heavy makeup, and applied just a light touch of powder. She looked even younger than when she dazzled on stage. Wei Zekai glanced at her. At first glance, she seemed no different from when they were in school.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was a pampered little princess who had never experienced the harsh realities of the world, but she was well-mannered…
 

 
She was the best girl Wei Zekai had ever known.
 

 
The car stopped at a red light. It began to rain lightly outside, and the raindrops blurred the streetlights that fell on her face, casting a shadow of freckles across her nose.
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke softly, "Zekai..."
 

 
Wei Zekai spoke first, "Are you really going to marry Shi Qianqiu?"
 

 
...
 

 
The bride is me!?
 

 
Tong Zhao had thought of many ridiculous answers, but she never imagined it would land on her. Her face showed a look of confusion.
 

 
Seeing that she didn't respond, Wei Zekai felt a bitterness in his heart—he had just thought Shí Qiānqiū was a master of tea arts, but the true "green tea" was actually him. Shi Qianqiu was Tong Zhao’s real boyfriend. The words hit his heart like a hammer, bitter like lotus seed paste. If this were happening to Shi Qianqiu or Jiang Dang, they would have acted the moment they realized their feelings, not caring whether the other party was about to get married or not...
 

 
But Wei Zekai cared.
 

 
Even if there was a one in a thousand chance that Tong Zhao would choose him, he didn’t want her to become someone who betrayed her partner.
 

 
He was willing to be the shameless person who pined for a married woman.
 

 
But he didn’t want her character to be tarnished in the slightest.
 

 
The comfortable business car had become a cage. At that moment, Wei Zekai wished he could be in his sports car, ignoring everything, pressing the accelerator to the floor, going at a speed of eight hundred miles per hour, with his mood as bright as the sun... But unfortunately, he couldn’t. This car could also go fast, but with Tong Zhao sitting in the passenger seat, he didn’t want to scare her.
 

 
Just as the poor puppy was about to burst into tears, Tong Zhao cleared her throat and said, "I’m not marrying him. We’re not even dating. We’re just friends. He was just teasing you, and you fell for it."
 

 
She then took out her phone to strengthen her argument and sent a message to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [When are we having the wedding?]
 

 
Shí Qianqiu: [Hahahahaha!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Shall we go get the marriage license tomorrow?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’m afraid Wei Zekai will kill me. I’ve already booked the fastest flight to Hawaii tonight.]
 

 
Wow, he’s off to play again. Truly carefree.
 

 
"… Huh?"
 

 
Hearing that voice full of confusion, Tong Zhao finally remembered that there was a silly boy beside her who had been completely fooled: "How long have I been gone? And you already believe that I’m getting married? I don’t know if I should say he’s too good at lying or you’re just too easy to fool."
 

 
"… Oh.”
 

 
Amidst great sorrow and joy, Wei Zekai was stunned into a fool who could only respond with single words.
 

 
After arriving at Yu Long Xuan, Wei Zekai parked the car in his own small garage—because the homeowners here usually own more than one car, many of them buy the garage together with the property.
 

 
Wei Zekai also owned property here and would occasionally be neighbors with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was only "occasionally" because they didn’t get much time off at the same time, so they didn’t often have the chance to rest at home together.
 

 
"So..."
 

 
The garage was brightly lit, the lights spilling into the car, warming half of his face. His eyes were bright and gleaming, like a stray dog that had just realized it wasn’t abandoned: "You’re still single?"
 

 
"Always have been."
 

 
Seeing that he still had something to say, Tong Zhao didn’t rush to get out of the car.
 

 
Even though it was comfortable, the car was still an enclosed space. In such a quiet environment, the sensitivity to emotions was magnified, and Tong Zhao could feel the tension in the air, making her throat feel dry.
 

 
To Tong Zhao, Wei Zekai had always been the image of a harmless, soft big dog.
 

 
Of course, if she said that aloud, no one would believe it. Wei Zekai without aggression? He was the most proud and unruly second-generation heir in this circle, the hardest to deal with. Ever since he started a serious business and began making money, he frequently snatched projects from older industry veterans. It wasn’t until he became more enlightened that he realized the Wèi family hadn’t invested in him for nothing; he truly had the skills.
 

 
But in front of Tong Zhao, he was just a big goofy dog wagging his tail.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai was staring straight ahead at nothing, his lips tightly pressed together, his eyes shining.
 

 
Suddenly, he turned his head to her: "So you don’t like him?"
 

 
After their eyes met, she smiled first:
 

 
"I do like him in a friendship way, but I never thought about dating him. As for the future, I wouldn’t deny that it’s possible. After all, he’s a very charming man."
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled that her highest admiration for Shi Qianqiu came when they worked together on a film project. A versatile, multi-talented partner, someone who had both aesthetic sense and talent—who wouldn’t like that? It even created the illusion of mutual respect, wanting to spend a lifetime together. But after the work was finished, that feeling gradually faded.
 

 
"I don't want that possibility," Wei Zekai quickly interrupted her.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Wei Zekai stared at her intently.
 

 
He could feel his heartbeat racing, so fast it seemed to merge into one, his chest muscles nearly burning with the intensity, making his emotions surge. He wasn’t the kind of person who got muddled or unclear; he just hadn’t realized before, hadn’t experienced it, and didn’t know that every time he saw Tong Zhao, it was because he liked her.
 

 
That feeling was something more than brotherly affection.
 

 
When had it changed?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s light-colored eyes reflected his tense, almost stiff face. It didn’t seem particularly graceful, but he oddly liked the feeling of filling her field of vision and wanted to keep it that way, as if he had finally figured out the right approach to a problem. The difficult puzzle that once made no sense to him suddenly became clear. His feelings for Tong Zhao hadn’t changed; perhaps, perhaps it had been that way from the very beginning…
 

 
"We first met at school. I was playing basketball, and the ball accidentally got hit out of bounds."
 

 
"You were wearing a school skirt, looking so gentle and graceful, I was really afraid the ball would hit you, but then you..."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed to be recounting the story of how they met in a disjointed manner.
 

 
For him, it was something that had happened a few years ago.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, however, it felt like a memory from a past life, something she could only slowly recall from his narration.
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been athletic, and when she heard his loud warning, she easily caught the basketball, giving him an amused glance. "Xu Zhu was surprised you apologized and thanked me. She said you looked down on everyone and didn’t hang out with girls. She thought your attitude toward me would be really bad.”
 

 
"Right, you two were still good friends back then."
 

 
Wei Zekai said, "I remembered you from that moment."
 

 
Their families weren’t in the same class financially—Wei family’s wealth was far above everyone else's—while the school they attended was a well-known private institution with sky-high tuition fees. Despite the difference in their backgrounds, the two of them surprisingly became familiar with each other. In terms of family background, Wei Zekai was naturally stronger, but in the eyes of their classmates, Tong Zhao was the unattainable, high mountain flower. She had inherited the beauty of her actress mother and had a natural leadership charisma that cared for others in her conversations.
 

 
At that time, these were just potentials.
 

 
She was impressive in school, but once she entered the real world, it wasn’t enough. And back then, Tong Zhao hadn’t had the chance to slowly nurture that potential. She was knocked down by a series of misfortunes... until a fortunate encounter gave her the opportunity to cultivate those small seeds into towering trees across many worlds, which led to the Tong Zhao we know now.
 

 
Tong Zhao was lost in the memories he described.
 

 
Ever since she returned from the quick-travel worlds, she hadn’t allowed Xu Zhu to appear in her line of sight, but before her travels, Xu Zhu was indeed a good friend who had grown up with her.
 

 
If she were to hide "Xu Zhu" in her memories, the person who would take up the most space would be Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had tried countless times to pull himself out of the mire, but back then, they were both so stubborn and loved to argue. The words they spoke to each other were hurtful...
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "It seems like I was really lucky the day I met you."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was just about to muster the courage to confess, was hit with a blow.
 

 
The feeling was like being fed sugar by a master.
 

 
"Is... is that so? You're really polite, good buddy."
 

 
He got too shy and couldn’t express himself clearly.
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Wei Zekai realized he couldn’t keep calling her "buddy." He gripped the steering wheel, swallowed hard, and his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
"I’ve figured it out."
 

 
"I've liked you from the very beginning.”
 

 
"It's not the kind of liking that friends have, and I don't want to be just a brother."
 

 
"I want to be your boyfriend."
 

 
It was too shy.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew that when he thought too much, things tended to go wrong. So, he simply shut off the connection between his brain and his heart, and everything he had been hiding inside, he laid bare for Tong Zhao to see.
 

 
Each word was unthought-out but carried the feelings that had settled in his heart for a long, long time.
 

 
Long enough that in the previous life, he never had the chance to say it.
 

 
After he said everything he needed to say, the sensor light turned off, as there had been no movement for a while. The only light left in the car was the interior car light, casting shadows that deepened the handsome contours of Wei Zekai's face, making them hard to discern.
 

 
"...Hmm, I guessed it."
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
If she had really been surprised, her emotional intelligence would be on the same level as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
Her thoughts drifted far away, remembering how in her past life, she too had been an innocent fool without any experience in relationships. She and Wei Zekai had a huge argument, though she couldn’t remember the reason. She told him to get lost, that she didn’t need him to care. Could a friend care for a lifetime? He got angry and said, "So what if I want to care for a lifetime? I’m Wei Zekai. I can care for you all my life." The words sounded very childish, but looking back, it was probably mixed with love, even if she didn’t understand it at the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, her lips curling. "Being stupid is really a sin."
 

 
"...?"
 

 
Wei Zekai, the confused little puppy, didn’t understand if he was being scolded.
 

 
Being stupid means not understanding. Not understanding means missing out.
 

 
And once something is missed, it’s gone forever.
 

 
This wasn’t funny.
 

 
Wei Zekai grew anxious. "No, don't think I’m stupid. Actually, I’m quite smart." He brought up some of the recent projects he had successfully completed, afraid that Tong Zhao would misunderstand and reject his confession because she thought he was foolish.
 

 
"I didn’t say you’re stupid, I just remembered one thing I didn’t finish," Tong Zhao said, raising her hand. Her cool fingertips touched his cheek, then she grabbed his wrist and leaned in to kiss him.
 

 
"You made me a little unhappy because you took so long to figure it out, little puppy.”
# Chapter137: Emotional Extra (3) Pampering Zhao Zhao
A long, lingering kiss.
 

 
Wei Zekai remembered the time when they were filming ‘Sea King Killer’. They had shared a kiss like this before, one that he spent many nights thinking about before he could finally push it from his mind. Back then, he had felt that his brotherly feelings for Tong Zhao were beginning to change, which he thought was wrong. It was something from a long time ago, something he had thought he had completely forgotten. But when their lips met, that familiar sensation rushed back vividly.
 

 
This time, it wasn't for a movie, it was real life.
 

 
One of his wrists was held by her, and he could only use his other hand to gently pull her by the back of the head, deepening the kiss.
 

 
So this is what kissing feels like?
 

 
It wasn't the sweetness described in novels. Wei Zekai tasted the flavor of lipstick on her lips. More than the warmth of her skin, it was the temperature of their mucous membranes, the tension in their lips and tongues entwining. He forgot to close his eyes and even saw her long, curled eyelashes, delicate like a doll. He felt a thrill as if he were doing something bad—he had always wanted to do this with his good friend, to kiss her, to know the taste of her tongue.
 

 
When they pulled apart, Tong Zhao's pupils were slightly darker. She asked him, "What are you thinking?"
 

 
"I..." Wei Zekai, his mind blank, curved his lips, now smeared with lipstick. "What should we name our kids?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao reminded him, "Let me educate you—kissing doesn't make you pregnant."
 

 
"...I know! I was just nervous!"
 

 
Wei Zekai shot her a reproachful look, then furrowed his brows, feeling that the situation was more complicated than he thought. "Do you just want to play with me, or don't you want to marry me?"
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Tong Zhao also couldn't understand why, in this day and age, someone would think about marriage just after a single kiss. The car had the heater on, the air was a bit stuffy, and after their passionate kiss, Wei Zekai's face was flushed, making his usual bold, unruly expression soften with an inexplicable shyness.
 

 
The more she looked at him, the cuter he seemed, and her lips involuntarily curved into a smile.
 

 
This smile, however, drove Wei Zekai crazy.
 

 
"What's so funny?! I'm really good at this!"
 

 
Confident in his skills, Wei Zekai kissed her again with lightning speed. She had previously grabbed his wrist, so he now grabbed her waist and the back of her neck, kissing her fiercely. The description of it is not appropriate...
 

 
But actually, it wasn’t that bad.
 

 
The car was cramped, and she could feel the almost scorching warmth of his lips and tongue, along with his sharp canine brushing against her tongue, making her feel like she'd been nibbled on by a dog.
 

 
When Wei Zekai had had enough, she gently pushed him away. He only loosened the kiss but still awkwardly held onto her in an uncomfortable position.
 

 
Tong Zhao honestly expressed her feelings.
 

 
Wei Zekai, embarrassed and angry, retorted:
 

 
"Fine, I'm a dog! I used to be wild, but now I'm domesticated. You better keep me on a leash."
 

 
Tong Zhao was amused by his clumsy attitude, and with a deep smile, she responded, "Okay," while hooking her hand around the back of his neck and gently pulling him closer:
 

 
"Good boy."
 

 
＊
 

 
Tong Zhao’s relationship wasn’t something to be taken lightly, and she wasn’t just playing around with Wei Zekai; she was serious about their relationship. So, how to make it public became a priority on their agenda. Her team held a meeting for an entire day to come up with a public relations strategy, which felt absurd and unreal.
 

 
But it was necessary.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had been involved in a few scandals in the past, all of which had been cleared up, and since she and Wei Zekai were childhood friends and business partners, the public was already sensitive to them being seen together. Only some fans who supported their relationship would say they’d just gotten another dose of "new sugar."
 

 
Considering his girlfriend’s public relations needs, Wei Zekai behaved quite well. After confirming their relationship, he acted no differently than before.
 

 
Work was still work, and play was still play.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a little surprised.
 

 
Her team began to drop subtle hints, bringing their gossip back into the public eye.
 

 
A marketing account commented on the compatibility between Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, and netizens began to realize just how much this handsome second-generation rich young man had improved since his role in ‘Sea King Killer’. People tend to be more lenient when it comes to characters they've watched grow over the years, and as they spoke of him, their impressions became more positive. Additionally, the Wei family had always been generous with charity under the name of their only son, creating an image of a socially conscious genius entrepreneur.
 

 
Wei Zekai rummaged through old boxes and handed some photos from their middle and high school days to the public relations team.
 

 
With the hype being deliberately stirred up, public opinion became increasingly loud.
 

 
Industry professionals with a sharp sense had already guessed that she was likely to go public with her relationship.
 

 
Every media outlet was eager to get exclusive information about Tong Zhao’s love life.
 

 
However, ever since she won the award for ‘Iya Myth’, the usually low-key actress had only taken on a few high-profile commercial events. The latest variety show she had filmed wouldn’t air for another two months, so there was no way to catch her.
 

 
A few days later, the couple at the center of the gossip finally made a statement.
 

 
They didn't give any media outlet an exclusive, instead, they both posted on Weibo.
 

 
Wei Zekai wrote a long post, recalling sweet memories from their time together, from their middle school photos to game screenshots, to their in-game relationships in ‘King of Glory’ and ‘League of Legends’, photos with their in-game characters, screenshots of their duos in ‘PUBG’, their signatures on one of the Zeshan project contracts, and proof of his investment in Tong Zhao’s film project.
 

 
Their lives had been intertwined with traces of each other, and they had finally come together.
 

 
This official announcement, with its smooth, inevitable tone, was sweet enough to melt many people.
 

 
What moved netizens the most was the final paragraph of Wei Zekai’s post:
 

 
[I’ve known since the day I was born that I’d never have to worry about food or drink. I didn’t know what was good or what was bad.]
 

 
[Being proactive? If where I stand is the finish line, what direction should I take to move forward? It wasn’t until I met that girl who almost got hit by my basketball. She caught my mistake, smiled at me, and generously forgave me. Since then, I started paying attention to everything about Tong Zhao. From that moment on, my life had a source of light, and I no longer felt lost. As long as I stay close to her and move in her direction, I’m moving forward.]
 

 
[My life’s motivation is to become more worthy of her.]
 

 
Wei Zekai also shared a puzzle piece.
 

 
One side of the puzzle was a photo of Tong Zhao smiling with her Huaying Award trophy, while the other side was a photo that netizens had never seen before—a candid shot from her high school days, holding a certificate on stage. From the angle, it seemed like Wei Zekai had secretly taken the picture from below the stage with his phone.
 

 
In his eyes, she was always the most dazzling presence.
 

 
With the groundwork already laid, the comments were unsurprisingly supportive. Fans’ basic comments included reminders for him to treat Tong Zhao well, while the rest of the popular comments were more typical:
 

 
[Childhood sweethearts with a fairy tale romance!!!!!!]
 

 
[Men who can write little essays are so rare, ‘sob sob sob’, I feel like I’m in the civil affairs bureau!]
 

 
[I saw the date they linked their couple relationship, so you really weren’t together before? Oh my gosh, you guys are truly best friends.]
 

 
Compared to the male side’s announcement, the female side’s official post was as simple as a steel straight guy’s tweet—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 
This time, I didn’t miss it. @Wei Zekai
 

 
There wasn’t even a picture attached.
 

 
The caption was written by Tong Zhao herself, and the team respected her decision. As for the lack of pictures, they couldn’t decide on what to use during the meeting—couple photos were too mushy, items like matching game controllers, limited edition sneakers, luxury cars, or clothes were all rejected. At one point, Wei Zekai even suggested a matching private jet, but that was also turned down.
 

 
So, they chose no pictures over pictures, letting netizens slowly figure it out, which suited her style.
 

 
That is, personal matters were not to be displayed to the public.
 

 
What does “didn’t miss it” mean?
 

 
It sounds a bit painful.
 

 
Some netizens went to ask Wei Zekai on his Weibo, but he didn’t respond, because he honestly didn’t know either.
 

 
The real answer could only be known by Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Netizens were dying of curiosity, eager to know how a fairy-tale couple like them dated—however, the reality was harsh. The obscure, indifferent, 18th-tier celebrities tried to ride the trending search by showing off their love, while the internationally renowned actress and her billionaire boyfriend remained so low-key that even their couple photos were rarely leaked.
 

 
This was supposed to be the sweet, honeymoon phase after confirming their relationship!
 

 
No couple photos?
 

 
No cute daily love moments?
 

 
Not appearing together on variety shows?
 

 
So how exactly does this fairy-tale couple date?
 

 
Tong Zhao was wrong.
 

 
She was really wrong.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously thought that Wei Zekai was very calm about dating, since they were already familiar with each other. What hadn't they done besides kissing, hugging, and holding hands? At the time, she admired him and thought that Zekai had a broad perspective. However, since officially announcing their relationship and receiving the recognition and status from Tong Zhao’s PR team—“Now that you've publicly announced, you can freely enjoy your sweet romance”—Wei Zekai had lifted the seal.
 

 
After getting Tong Zhao’s consent, Wei Zekai secretly moved into her house—after all, she had plenty of guest rooms, and the security and privacy at Yu Long Xuan (the name of the estate) were more than sufficient to guarantee his safety. Even when he was single, many people knew that they were neighbors living in the same community.
 

 
Next came the couple avatars and couple signatures on all their gaming and social media accounts.
 

 
All the games.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind about game IDs—just a random string of characters. Some of her accounts even had randomly typed gibberish as IDs. So, she allowed him to do it: "I’m too lazy to go change them one by one. You know the passwords, you do it."
 

 
A few days later, when she logged into the game during the break, she saw the group named: (Spoiling Zhao Zhao).
 

 
The personal signature read: [Playing King of Glory for Zhao Zhao].
 

 
Tong Zhao: "..."
 

 
Thank you, that’s a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Her gibberish ID was also changed to "Zhao Zhao."
 

 
Short IDs like this were quite expensive, but things that had a price tag weren’t a problem for Wei Zekai. If it could be bought, he’d just get it.
 

 
And this was just the beginning.
 

 
Tong Zhao's entire gaming profile seemed to have become a collection of online couple IDs, with all sorts of styles. There were also dedicated groups, and from them, it was clear that Wei Zekai had labeled himself as [Husband], [Boyfriend], [Baby], [Sweetheart], [Bodyguard]... The list went on.
 

 
In the past, when they played together, Wei Zekai would want to team up with her as their duo.
 

 
Now, when they played together, Wei Zekai would say: "Baby, put Yao Yao on my head."
 

 
Tong Zhao, the gold medal mage, responded with a question mark.
 

 
The wild king from before quickly backed down: "Then I'll play Yao Yao and put her on your head."
 

 
That was much better.
 

 
The family dynamics were simple, clear, and straightforward.
 

 
And then later…
 

 
When the Zeshan team played together, they were shocked to discover that the former wild area mad dog not only had a fully leveled support character but was also calling out in voice chat: "Baby, come meet me at the fountain." "I don’t want to go home alone, come pick me up." And, "That marksman just hit me, go and kill him!"
 

 
He even sent heart gestures to Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was terrifying! How had they never noticed that Wei Zekai had this tough yet tender side?
 

 
The key was, he was having so much fun with it.
 

 
Whenever their opponents called him a "green tea Yao," he would proudly hang Yao on the mid-lane, showing off.
 

 
[All] Zhao Zhao: I spoiled him.
# Chapter138: Variety Show Extra (1)
What’s it like to have your idol explode in popularity?
 

 
Endless schedules, being able to see your idol's heavenly beauty every day, no longer needing to explain who your favorite star is in the vast sea of celebrities, not having to worry about your idol lacking resources, just having to worry about whether you can keep up with it all...
 

 
It’s so blissful.
 

 
Basically, every fan of a reality show contestant dreams of the day when they can make it alongside their idol.
 

 
But what’s it like when your idol becomes a film queen?
 

 
You can get a glimpse from the comments under Tong Zhao’s Weibo.
 

 
[Sis, can you appear on some variety shows? Even a livestream for sales would be fine, or a gaming stream? I miss you, sis.]
 

 
[Skip the sales, just go on more variety shows.]
 

 
[When was the last time we saw you in public? Oh, it was when you were hosting the charity auction gala, Little Zhāo.]
 

 
[Only shows at that level can afford to invite Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[6 tears, want to see a couple’s variety show, want to see you dominate the trending searches!]
 

 
Looking back, it feels like Tong Zhao’s debut was just yesterday.
 

 
Fans miss those days so much. Every movie would have variety shows in between, and she’d frequently make appearances.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao never really followed the idol path; it was just that her superstar aura was too strong. Not only did she have great works, but she also attracted fans, who worshiped her like a goddess. Since Tong Zhao won the Best Actress award at the Huaying Awards for ‘Iya Myth’, her crown became even more solid. She quickly became known as a top actress… which also meant that, unless absolutely necessary, her public exposure was reduced.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had already passed the stage where she needed excessive exposure.
 

 
Fans could only wait endlessly.
 

 
Fans from other fandoms, hearing their own idols complain, couldn’t help but feel a bit of the ‘Versailles’ effect — their own idol would be overjoyed just to get a supporting role in a big production, fighting tooth and nail over that minor role, and debating for days and nights over secondary billing, but Tong Zhao? She had a top-tier team serving her, and as long as she nodded, hundreds of millions in investments would fall into place. No matter which set she joined, she would be guaranteed the lead role, and no one could take it from her.
 

 
Isn’t that unfair?
 

 
It ‘is’ unfair, but fans also just really want to see more of Tong Zhao…
 

 
With nothing to do, fans would comment under Wei Zekai's Weibo, asking him not to hide his girlfriend and urging him to let Zhao take on more variety shows and appear more often.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied to this lucky fan’s comment: [Do you think I have a say in her acting career?]
 

 
[...That makes sense.]
 

 
[The family hierarchy is pretty clear.]
 

 
[How about some couple photos to show off?]
 

 
Not long after, the fan received a game screenshot.
 

 
The fans collectively sighed in frustration.
 

 
They wanted to see ‘actual’ photos of her!
 

 
And even if it was a screenshot, it was of Wei Zekai playing the cute support character, Yao, while Tong Zhao was playing Shanguan Wan'er, coldly poking her way through the mid-lane, as if saying, “Do you think you’re worthy of lining up against me?” It was incredibly cool.
 

 
@Wei Zekai: [You all ask for so much [couple photos]]
 

 
The photo was newly taken, showing Tong Zhao in black loungewear sitting on the couch, flipping through documents. Half of her long, fair legs were visible, and her side profile was delicate and cold, exuding a strong, professional woman aura. Meanwhile, Wei Zekai wore a coral fleece pajama with a monster design, making a peace sign next to her, his handsome smile carrying a hint of pride.
 

 
...
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai was reading the comments under his Weibo post with the couple photo.
 

 
"Can't say they're a match made in heaven, just that they're completely mismatched."
 

 
"Where are they mismatched? You have no taste!"
 

 
"Hey, that's not bad, the little monster and its tamer! Sounds a bit suggestive."
 

 
Wei Zekai scrolled down and saw a comment with a lot of likes and replies that kept increasing. Curious, he clicked on it, and...
 

 
A fan had used a Q-version watermelon sticker to cover Wei Zekai's head in the couple photo, turning the couple's picture into a solo shot of Tong Zhao. Other fans were delighted, and the "objectified" Wei Zekai, with an ellipsis on his forehead, was dramatically depicted as the little monster pouting on the sofa, looking up at the owner of the house—Tong Zhao, who was flipping through documents. The caption read, "Baby, your fans are bullying me, aren't you going to do something about it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had been nudged slightly into the sofa, grabbed his neck with one hand and said, "Not enough fun, do you want me to join in and bully you too?"
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Well, it's not like it's impossible."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "Watch the limits."
 

 
The little monster huffed and pouted.
 

 
"Forget it, let's stop looking," Tong Zhao tossed the documents onto the coffee table and snuggled into his fluffy pajama-clad chest. "I'm a bit tired of looking."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had been acting like a little puppy, immediately switched back to his usual tone, dropping the boyish voice. He held her in his arms and gently patted her back, as if soothing a child. "You can wait for me, I'll go over the important points with you once I finish. Don't waste your energy; didn't you read a bunch of scripts the past few days?"
 

 
Tong Zhao softly hummed, her low voice betraying a kind of exhaustion she usually kept hidden from the outside world: "You help me look at it."
 

 
"Okay, baby."
 

 
Helping his girlfriend look over the documents!
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a sense of accomplishment, as though all his hard work in studying was meant for this moment.
 

 
Thanks to her cultivation, Tong Zhao usually had great stamina and mental energy. She rarely felt tired and was even known as a "iron woman" in the industry. But ever since she started dating Wei Zekai, during these private moments of being alone together, these psychological fatigue feelings popped up like mushrooms after a rain, making her want to whine and complain to her boyfriend... Something she never would have imagined doing before.
 

 
Was it because love made her weaker?
 

 
Later, Tong Zhao reflected on her own feelings and realized that after a little whining and complaining during their dates, she felt more energized and focused on her work.
 

 
Consort Chen joked: "As long as you're not a true immortal, everyone needs a place for their emotions to rest."
 

 
It was okay to be a little more forgiving with herself. There was nothing wrong with that.
 

 
Compared to a truly clingy and sweet wife, Tong Zhao was rather cold-natured. Every time she took the initiative for a kiss or a hug, Wei Zekai was as delighted as if he'd won the lottery... Actually, he was probably even happier than winning the lottery. After all, winning a couple of hundred thousand was just a small bonus for his wealth, while a warm hug from his girlfriend meant so much more.
 

 
"Enough hugging."
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head from his chest and gave a small smile: "I noticed you really like showing off your love."
 

 
Wei Zekai sighed:
 

 
"If it weren't for your team stopping me, I would have paid for a yearly membership on Weibo hot search, just so our sweet little love story could stay in the top ten forever."
 

 
He really wanted the whole world to know how happy he was to be in a relationship with Tong Zhao.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao could only say, good thing they stopped him.
 

 
However, what she actually wanted to say was something else:
 

 
"By the way, Sister Chu also wants me to take on a customized variety show… Let’s go on a variety show together."
 

 
"A couple's variety show?"
 

 
Wei Zekai was excited.
 

 
He didn't usually watch variety shows, but he couldn't resist when Tong Zhao's fans were constantly encouraging him on Weibo to appear on one with his girlfriend.
 

 
Whether it was a couple's show or not didn’t matter; he just wanted to see his girlfriend on screen.
 

 
Wei Zekai was, at most, a somewhat good-looking accessory, or a large decoration.
 

 
He’d wanted to do this for a long time.
 

 
But Wei Zekai had always been reluctant to pressure his girlfriend.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao had brought it up herself, it was a different story.
 

 
"…Okay."
 

 
What Wei Zekai didn’t notice was that Tong Zhao's "okay" came with a slight pause, carrying some hidden meaning. He was so excited about the idea of being on a variety show with Tong Zhao that his little monster tail almost seemed to be wagging in the air.
 

 
*
 

 
Wei Zekai's good mood lasted until he arrived at the filming set and saw his old rival.
 

 
"Why is it you again???"
 

 
"Hey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from Sanya, was wearing flashy beach shorts and a T-shirt, with frog-shaped glasses on his head. He was lounging with his legs crossed in an office chair, raising his hand to greet Wei Zekai. Wei Zekai immediately wanted to grab his girlfriend and leave, but then he heard Shi Qianqiu leisurely explain: "Tong Zhao wants to try a brand-new variety show format, and she asked me to direct it. She thinks I'm the one who understands the most about her most charming side."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow, looking like an irritated little leopard. "She has many sides that only I’ve seen."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu smiled. "Like what?"
 

 
"Like—"
 

 
Before he could finish the third word, Tong Zhao covered his mouth from behind.
 

 
Watching the couple was too amusing, Shi Qianqiu laughed out loud.
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly said, "Don't try to get him to talk."
 

 
There was a reason for bringing Shi Qianqiu in to direct.
 

 
Ever since confirming her relationship with Wei Zekai, the other personalities in Tong Zhao's inner world had frequently wanted to interact with him, which was essentially like meeting the parents. At that time, Tong Zhao had an idea—since in instinctive filming, her personalities could be modeled in different ways, maybe it would be possible to have all the personalities appear at once during the filming? She mentioned this idea to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
The answer was yes, but it would put a heavy burden on the actor’s brain. A doctor would need to evaluate her in advance to ensure safety before filming could begin.
 

 
Thus, she asked Shi Qianqiu to lower his status and take on the role of variety show director...
 

 
The first reason was that other directors wouldn’t dare take on the responsibility.
 

 
Secondly, it was because Shi Qianqiu truly understood the charm points of her different personalities.
 

 
Even though it was a very self-interested customized variety show, Tong Zhao still hoped the audience would like her other sides.
 

 
Consort Chen, Duan Ge, Shuyi, Zhao Zai, Lu Xianchang, Hanzhi, Iya, and Tong Zhao herself—these eight personalities together could be described as a group of talents. They could even form two full tables for mahjong, not at all lacking in numbers. A large portion of the variety show budget was spent on modeling, and it was only after confirming that Tong Zhao could support eight similar-looking but distinctly different subconscious personalities that they proceeded with the modeling.
 

 
The explanation for the public had already been planned out.
 

 
They would say that due to family changes, Tong Zhao had long been inclined to imagine herself experiencing various lives in different worlds. There are many people in the entertainment industry with mental health issues, and while Tong Zhao's case wasn't particularly new, creating such specific and varied subconscious personalities was indeed unique.
 

 
After getting rid of the disgruntled Wei Zekai and sending him off to prepare for the shooting capsule, Shi Qianqiu finally asked, "Did you tell him about the shooting content?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
"I guessed as much," Shi Qianqiu smiled and said, seeing through the situation immediately. "Looks like he thought it was a couples' variety show. No wonder he pulled that long face when he saw me. Well, you go ahead and get ready in the shooting room."
 

 
After Tong Zhao left, Shi Qianqiu reminisced about Wei Zekai's expression and couldn't help but smile more as he thought about it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was still young, after all.
 

 
He didn’t know that when shooting a variety show, the one person you must never offend is the director.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu considered himself magnanimous and wouldn’t purposely make things difficult for him, much less resort to malicious editing.
 

 
"Hey, the modeling team, come over here. Add a little tail and dog ears to the male lead."
 

 
After giving this thoughtful instruction, Shi Qianqiu bit into a refreshing, sweet, and crunchy red apple.
 

 
He couldn’t wait for the variety show to begin shooting.
# Chapter139: Variety Show Extras (2) — As Long As It's You, Tong Zhao, I Like It...
"Tong Zhao Confidential File - REAL" is a variety show in a live broadcast format.
 

 
Of course, it will also release a polished, edited version later through post-production.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the length of live broadcasts, the live version’s bullet screen comments (live viewer chat) tend to be sparse, and its topic popularity relatively low.
 

 
But that’s under normal circumstances.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, it is an unspoken rule: anything involving "Tong Zhao" must be approached with high expectations and premium standards. Yet, no matter how creative or bold their imaginations are, the actual outcomes often exceed them.
 

 
Just like "REAL"—
 

 
Before the live broadcast even started, the promotional teaser alone had already caused a sensation, breaking records by completely filling hundreds of viewing rooms. Another polished version of a variety show that aired on the same day was tragically ignored, relegated to obscurity, hoping viewers would someday remember to check out its replay. Not only did "REAL" secure the top spot in viewership rankings, but the gap between it and the second place was astronomically large.
 

 
This might just be the difference between legends and ordinary people!
 

 
---
 

 
The Promotional Teaser
 

 
- [I heard they’re modeling all of Tong Zhao’s subconscious types? This idea is crazy!]
 
- [It’s possible in theory, but barely achievable in practice.]
 
- [My idol count just multiplied by eight! My happiness multiplied by eight too!]
 
- [These fans are too wild! I suspect by the time I finish this show, I’ll have face blindness for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
Fans and netizens were already familiar with Tong Zhao’s different subconscious personas through her association’s official reports and Director Shi’s microfilms. So when this topic came up, they could vaguely imagine what it might look like.
 

 
Of course, there were also those simply enjoying this heavenly couple’s romantic variety show.
 

 
- [I want to see Tong Zhao get jealous of herself!!!]
 

 
- [Ah, is this a “Kai’s Harem Experience Card”?]
 
- [Finally, we can see them in the same frame. ‘crying in joy’]
 

 
Under the public’s eager anticipation, the pre-recorded promotional trailer began to play.
 

 
---
 

 
The first scene was an aerial shot—
 

 
Gentle sea breezes, towering mountain peaks stretching endlessly, and a luxurious castle nestled deep within a forest. At first glance, one might mistake it for a tourism documentary. With Shi Qianqiu's mastery of the camera, the sequence was stunningly picturesque.
 

 
However, the castle didn’t exude much warmth.
 

 
It was shrouded in dark clouds occasionally illuminated by flashes of lightning, appearing grayish and somewhat eerie.
 

 
---
 

 
[This instinctive variety show is a reality show of the heart.]
 
[Revealing the truest side of public figures.]
 

 
[So, what is the true nature of the famous actress Tong Zhao, known for her diverse subconscious personas? The production team has gone to great lengths to uncover her different sides—]
 

 
At this moment, the promotional video cut to a behind-the-scenes interview.
 

 
At the center of the screen was Shi Qianqiu, wearing sunglasses.
 

 
The comment section erupted with playful criticism:
 

 
- [Why is he wearing sunglasses indoors?]
 
- [And of course, it's the classic aviators.]
 
- [Let me hear the nonsense he's about to say.]
 

 
"It's honestly a hassle," Shi Qianqiu said with a tone that was both exasperated and full of admiration. "Tong Zhao, just how many surprises are you hiding from us?"
 

 
Once this statement was played, the footage quickly transitioned back to the castle interior.
 

 
As the comments speculated that Shi Qianqiu had only appeared to show off, the screen revealed a woman descending a spiral staircase lined with red carpet.
 

 
The castle’s interior was designed in a Western style, but the woman wore a traditional Eastern ceremonial dress. The fusion of East and West created an unexpectedly striking aesthetic. She appeared to be a youthful version of Tong Zhao, her delicate smile and the charm in her eyes effortlessly captivating the viewers.
 

 
It was Tong Zhao—anyone could tell at a glance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao rarely displayed such a charming and alluring expression. Only her most devoted fans could recall this signature demeanor from her cameo as the imperial concubine in ‘Emperor Ming’.
 

 
She exuded a seductive elegance, but it was clear to viewers that this wasn’t a woman to be casually disrespected or teased. As she faced the audience and curved her lips into a slight smile, a name and a brief introduction flashed onto the freeze-frame with dramatic "bang bang bang" sound effects:
 

 
[Consort Chen.
 
Tong Zhao once fantasized about traveling to a distant time and place, rising from obscurity to become the most favored Consort in the palace.]
 

 
To justify why each persona had such detailed backstories, Tong Zhao had to embrace a youthful, "cringe-worthy" phase of her imagination where her teenage self had an overactive imagination. After a moment of surprise, the audience burst into laughter:
 

 
- [Wait, this is a thing? I didn’t see that coming!]
 
- [Carrying Consort Chen, and I’m sprinting 100 meters already!]
 
- [So even Sister Zhao daydreamed about legendary lives like the rest of us? Feels so relatable!]
 

 
Among all the personas, Han Zhi and Iya had the thickest barrage of comments.
 

 
The former naturally attracted a wave of "girlfriend fans," while the latter was an internationally renowned character. After ‘Iya’s Myth' won an award, Director Shi Qianqiu, seeing the film’s potential, managed to have it released in international holographic cinemas, where it surprisingly achieved impressive box office results. This introduced the goddess's charm to foreign audiences.
 

 
When fans learned that the character Iya was inspired by Tong Zhao's youthful imagination, they admired her even more.
 

 
"She’s too imaginative!"
 

 
Some fans even suggested that since all of her personas were so charming, each could be turned into a movie, which would undoubtedly result in multiple blockbuster hits. This idea became a popular comment, with fans treating it as a fun fantasy—unknowingly hitting close to the truth.
 

 
After all the personas made their entrances, the narrator’s voice, clear and expressive, concluded with a teasing remark:
 

 
[When they all gather together to face Tong Zhao’s official boyfriend, Wei Zekai, what kind of sparks will fly?]
 
[Let’s stay tuned to find out!]
 

 
The final shot froze on Han Zhi’s stunned expression as she turned her head.
 

 
- [Hahahaha, this is too much!]
 
- [The first girlfriend fan to have their idol’s “house collapse”—but instead of a sister-in-law, it’s…]
 
- [How do I even describe this appropriately?]
 
- [Ahhh, I can’t wait to watch the full episode!]
 

 
With the buildup provided by this setting, the audience came to accept the idea that these personas represented different stages of Tong Zhao’s worldview. Some experts speculated that Tong Zhao’s brain might be more developed than average, allowing her to store more detailed memories. However, since Tong Zhao declined to undergo further testing, mainstream opinion settled on the idea that she was simply a unique case, leaving the truth a mystery.
 

 
Because Tong Zhao was so famous, some companies tried to cultivate new talents by encouraging them to develop diverse personas. However, this led to a few awkward and mismatched cases, and the idea was eventually abandoned. They had to accept the reality that her success was one of a kind.
 

 
---
 

 
The live broadcast began!
 

 
---
 

 
Wei Zekai slowly opened his eyes.
 

 
He found himself in a semi-lucid state, processing the background information provided by the scenario designer.
 

 
Although he wasn’t given a new identity, he was aware that he was still Wei Zekai, retaining all his real-life memories. The only additional context was a logical acceptance of the following:
 

 
- The eight women he would meet soon were all versions of Tong Zhao.
 
- The castle they were in was a projection of Tong Zhao’s subconscious mind.
 

 
[You are Wei Zekai.]
 
[You wish to propose to your beloved girlfriend. But like every man seeking to win his heart’s desire, you must first earn the approval of certain individuals.]
 
[The difference? These individuals aren’t her elders.]
 
[They are the different versions of Tong Zhao.]
 
[Do you have the confidence to win them over?]
 

 
In the live broadcast, Wei Zekai was seen sitting in a taxi. The driver asked him, “Young man, the place you’re heading to is really remote, huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai instinctively replied, “Yeah, my girlfriend lives in a pretty out-of-the-way spot.”
 

 
As the conversation ended, the taxi turned onto a narrow road. The view opened up to reveal the castle from the promotional video. After paying the fare, Wei Zekai picked up his suitcase and began walking toward it.
 

 
Surrounding the castle was a moat, with tall, spiked fences lining the edge—symbolizing Tong Zhao’s strong defensive nature and her territorial instincts.
 

 
Viewers who enjoy instinct-based reality shows often have a bit of voyeuristic curiosity.
 

 
For Tong Zhao’s fans, this custom-made show offered a chance to glimpse their idol’s truest self, worth pausing frame by frame to analyze and write essays about.
 

 
[So this is Her Majesty the Queen’s inner world?]
 
[If it were me, it’d probably be a tiny house full of silly decorations.]
 
[Hahahaha!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, wasn’t fazed. Standing in front of the grand gates, he shouted, “Baby—I’m here—let me in!”
 

 
As soon as Wei Zekai finished speaking, a giant black rose on the castle’s gate unfurled its petals, revealing a hidden fingerprint scanner. When Wei Zekai placed his hand on it, the system recognized his identity, and the rose gate opened with a creak as the drawbridge lowered.
 

 
The moment Wei Zekai stepped onto the bridge, it seemed to come alive, automatically sliding him forward.
 

 
Then, a magical scene unfolded.
 

 
The once gloomy and ominous castle transformed in an instant as the gates closed behind him. The dark clouds scattered, revealing the castle’s true nature—an idyllic paradise full of spring warmth, chirping birds, and vibrant flowers. It was a dreamlike vacation haven, reflecting Tong Zhao’s inner world when she was with someone she trusted and loved.
 

 
This breathtaking visual immediately captivated the audience.
 

 
[Wow, the director really is Shi Qianqiu—he’s amazing at creating concepts.]
 
[What kind of “spoiling the boyfriend” setup is this? All her favoritism goes to him?]
 
[Oh my god, the bridge moves on its own, taking him straight to her heart. I never expected Zhao Zhao to be this sweet when in love.]
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t great with words of affection.
 

 
When she loved someone, she showed it through her actions—by treating them well and keeping them close.
 

 
Wei Zekai stumbled forward and finally arrived at the castle’s grand entrance, only to face his first challenge.
 

 
Standing before the doors was a tall, imposing man dressed as a butler.
 

 
He bore a striking resemblance to Tong Zhao, sharing about seventy percent of her features, but his sharper facial structure and restrained gentleness set him apart.
 

 
This was Han Zhi, a familiar figure to Tong Zhao’s devoted fans.
 

 
In the next moment, those fans witnessed an unfamiliar side of their idol’s on-screen boyfriend.
 

 
Han Zhi, upon seeing Wei Zekai, furrowed his brows slightly. His handsome face showed clear disdain, as if he were reluctant to let this man pass.
 

 
“You’re supposed to be ‘my’ boyfriend?”
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned. “...Baby, did you ever have a phase where you wanted to be a boy?”
 

 
“First of all, don’t call me ‘baby’. Call me Han Zhi,” he replied coolly.
 

 
“In a period of gender identity confusion and questioning the meaning of existence... yes, Tong Zhao once fantasized about what it would be like if she were a man. And as you can see,” Han Zhi lifted a hand to adjust his tie. The slight movement drew the attention of the female audience to his sharp jawline and the subtle motion of his Adam’s apple. “A more aggressive, dominant male side. Can you accept that?”
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai’s expression looked as if his tail had been stepped on—absolutely flustered.
 

 
This was a sore spot for most men, and he was no exception.
 

 
But...
 

 
“So, are you still Tong Zhao?” he asked.
 

 
Han Zhi nodded indifferently.
 

 
Wei Zekai gritted his teeth. “As long as you’re Tong Zhao, I’ll like you!”
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Han Zhi looked surprised.
 

 
Not because of his heartfelt declaration.
 

 
But because, with a loud ‘poof’, a dog tail popped out from behind Wei Zekai.
# Chapter140: Variety Show Extras (3)
"..."
 

 
The scene froze in awkward silence.
 

 
Wei Zekai, panicking, tried to press down his tail, but to no avail. The once-erect fluffy tail drooped in nervousness. "What the hell? Why do I have a tail… I…"
 

 
"It's probably a construct of the subconscious world. In Tong Zhao's mind, anything is possible," Han Zhi explained, though he offered no consolation.
 

 
Instead, those melancholic, unreadable eyes carried a trace of a faintly mocking smile. "It’s… quite cute."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked like he had just been struck by lightning.
 

 
The AI voice picked up his inner thoughts:
 

 
[So...]
 

 
[In Tong Zhao’s eyes, am I just… a dog?!]
 

 
The barrage of comments on the livestream exploded with laughter, filling the screen with "hahahaha."
 

 
Wei Zekai's dog tail gave a despondent wag before a husky female voice came from behind Han Zhi.
 

 
"Han Zhi, who are you talking to?"
 

 
"A little puppy," Han Zhi replied calmly.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s head and tail both shot up as he looked toward the owner of the voice.
 

 
The newcomer had neatly styled short hair, and her small face, about the size of a palm, was framed by almond-shaped eyes with pale-colored irises. Her features resembled Tong Zhao’s, but the short hair made her features more defined, and she seemed slightly taller than Tong Zhao—perhaps due to some kind of stimulus from the post-apocalyptic world that caused a secondary development. Upon seeing Wei Zekai, she immediately smiled. "Xiao Kai."
 

 
"Uh, hello."
 

 
Wei Zekai greeted her politely, his handsome face showing clear signs of wariness and confusion.
 

 
She looked like his girlfriend.
 

 
But she wasn’t her.
 

 
[Is this another side of Tong Zhao...?] Wei Zekai thought, feeling somewhat lost.
 

 
"I’m Duan Ge," she introduced herself, then nudged Han Zhi to move aside. "Don’t just stand there, come inside, and stop picking on the kid."
 

 
Once Duan Ge spoke, Han Zhi stopped teasing Wei Zekai. He raised an eyebrow, a look that prompted a wave of screenshots from fangirls. "I wasn’t picking on him."
 

 
"True," Duan Ge said, as if recalling something amusing, and gave a small smile. "Wait until he meets the Consort, then he’ll know what real bullying is."
 

 
[Ahhh, I love this subconscious side of hers. So badass!]
 

 
[I think she’s more dominant than Brother Zhi... is that just my impression?]
 

 
[I became a fan of Tong Zhao after watching ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘One Life Survivor’. While her other works are also charming, they never quite gave me that heart-fluttering feeling... But after seeing Duan Ge, I realized—I like this type! I want to stick close to Duan Ge! I want her to step on my face with high heels!]
 

 
The last comment was quickly met with others criticizing the person for being a bit off.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a little uneasy.
 

 
From what she said, was the "Consort" a very frightening character?
 

 
His anxiously swaying tail betrayed his nervousness.
 

 
[But—]
 

 
[If it’s all still Tong Zhao in the end, then there’s nothing to fear.]
 

 
When this thought of Wei Zekai was captured by the AI, a highly upvoted comment popped up:
 

 
[Thank goodness I can’t read, or I might have been blinded by that.]
 

 
---
 

 
Under the guidance of the two, Wei Zekai entered the interior living room of the castle.
 

 
The living room was very spacious and grand, with the wooden floor polished to a shine, and the décor was in a medieval style. This surprised him a bit because Tong Zhao’s real-life home was designed with a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
 

 
He didn’t expect that she actually longed to live in a castle like this.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly made a resolution: when he wakes up from the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, he would definitely gift her a castle even more luxurious and grand than this one! Hmm, he might as well customize one as a wedding house. If Tong Zhao wasn’t planning on getting married soon, the wedding house could be used for the engagement—anyway, he just wanted to give her something special.
 

 
In the middle of the living room were two red carpeted stairways, about two meters wide, leading up to the second floor.
 

 
There were many doors on the second floor.
 

 
"Your task during these eight days is to live with two of Tong Zhao's subconscious personalities for two days each. You need to gain her approval and also experience whether you can accept her with different traits."
 

 
As Han Zhi explained, a special effects text appeared at the bottom of the screen to ensure that any viewers who hadn’t heard clearly understood the concept of the show.
 

 
Wei Zekai was startled. "Does that include you?"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Han Zhi made a face as if his limit had been reached, and coldly responded with a simple "Mm."
 

 
He quickly changed the subject. "Go ahead and pick your first door, don’t waste time."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "How about I pick you directly? Let’s start with the hardest option."
 

 
Han Zhi: "…"
 

 
[Hahaha, Brother Zhi’s life is a complete failure.]
 

 
[Help, Wei Zekai is really so silly.]
 

 
[Reminds me of Aquaman Killer.]
 

 
"Fine.”
 

 
Han Zhi's eyelids lowered for a moment, but in the blink of an eye, the initial look of surprise was completely gone, leaving no trace: "Exactly, it's just right. If you're not used to living with other girls, having me, a guy, to accompany you is perfect, right?"
 

 
"You're absolutely right."
 

 
This really struck a chord with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Although he knew they were all Tong Zhao, it was like with Duan Ge: she had a similar outline, but her aura was vastly different. He couldn’t help but instinctively want to keep a distance from other women who weren’t his girlfriend, let alone "live together." He put his arm around Han Zhi's shoulder and remembered something: "Didn’t we meet in ‘Aquaman Killer’? You even kissed Tong Zhao afterward!"
 

 
This event was particularly vivid for Wei Zekai.
 

 
At the time, he didn’t know what was going on during the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, but after waking up and watching the replay, he discovered that the two had been "secretly communicating" without his knowledge. Back then, he was conflicted, asking himself "I actually kissed a bro, and I kissed him so passionately?"—a moral dilemma that felt like being fried on a hot pan, turning over and over. Since he knew that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, he didn’t think too much about it.
 

 
Now, seeing such a large Han Zhi in front of him, even though he knew he was also a part of Tong Zhao...
 

 
He still felt jealous!
 

 
"Yeah, that's right."
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t deny it.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai completely remembered the plot of ‘Aquaman Killer’. Not only had Han Zhi kissed Tong Zhao, but in that variety show, it seemed that Tong Zhao was merely playing with his feelings. For Han Zhi, it was more like a skilled exchange, a mutual appreciation…
 

 
Thinking of this, Wei Zekai’s tail wagged furiously in anger.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him.
 

 
All of Tong Zhao’s personalities understood her very well, and there was no doubt about why she chose Wei Zekai. In fact, it was probably Tong Zhao herself who was the last to realize that she truly liked him.
 

 
"You don't have to overthink it,"
 
Han Zhi said as he walked up the stairs with him. "Pick a door and open it."
 

 
Wei Zekai was still preoccupied with the fact that he had kissed Tong Zhao and was somewhat distracted. He casually picked a door and turned the doorknob.
 

 
The door was surprisingly ornate.
 

 
A golden, jade-embedded door that looked extraordinary from the outside.
 

 
"You not only kissed her, but it was a French kiss!"
 

 
"Stop nagging,"
 
Han Zhi smirked. "You really know how to pick a door."
 

 
When the door was opened, a faint, enticing fragrance wafted out, and Wei Zekai froze for a moment. What he saw was a beautiful young girl lying on a concubine's couch—this was Tong Zhao from his memory, looking just like she did in high school. Her delicate face and eyes, full of life, were gazing at him.
 

 
The girl furrowed her brows slightly.
 

 
Even though she didn’t speak, Wei Zekai could clearly sense her displeasure from his prolonged and impetuous gaze.
 

 
He quickly looked away.
 

 
"It’s you, this thick-headed fool,"
 
she spoke, her sweet voice mixed with an air of arrogance, unlike Tong Zhao’s usual tone. It was as though she had long been accustomed to being in a superior position in a feudal society, constantly reminding others of the distance between them. But with the casual remark "thick-headed fool," she suddenly became more vivid, no longer just a beautiful object to admire. She grumbled in complaint, "Why is it you? I prefer Jiang Dang, and Shi Qianqiu would be fine too."
 

 
[???????]
 
[Is the DangZhao ship real??? Did it just have a bad ending????]
 
[Oops, I guess I have the same taste as the concubine sister, I also like Jiang Dang!]
 

 
When it came to matters of status, Wei Zekai was unwavering: "The people around Zhao Zhao have always been me."
 

 
"You... never mind,”
 

 
The concubine chuckled softly: "Indeed, it's always been you."
 

 
She waved her hand: "Come in and attend to this palace."
 

 
[Bonus scene with the director being called out: "If it's the Consort, I am truly honored."]
 

 
---
 

 
How to serve the most delicate Consort in the world is a technical skill.
 

 
And Wei Zekai clearly lacked the skills required.
 

 
But he was very earnest.
 

 
When the Consort asked him to fan her, Wei Zekai put in all his effort, fanning each stroke with great determination. The Consort's dark hair fluttered in the wind, her face and hair were tousled by the breeze. Instead of getting angry, she smiled and turned to look at him. He showed no signs of stopping, making her feel as though she was facing a wind fan. She laughed in exasperation: "Are you doing this on purpose or is it accidental?"
 

 
"Don’t worry, I'm well-known in the investment world for being both wise and brave. Not only am I sharp, but I also make time every week for fitness training. Don’t even talk about fanning you—I'd have no problem carrying you around."
 

 
The Consort: "..."
 

 
Being carried in a palanquin was a daily routine for her.
 

 
The Emperor occasionally gave her a princess carry.
 

 
However, being carried like a burlap sack was something else entirely. It was like a young girl getting married, or rather, a ghost marriage. Not only was it her first time, but there was also a fear that it might not bring joy.
 

 
The Consort propped her chin up with one hand and turned her face away from the wind: "Well, you're quite good at taking care of people. I’ve learned something new."
 

 
"I’m not good at taking care of people,"
 

 
Wei Zekai responded honestly, modestly praising himself: "I imagined you as a pregnant Tong Zhao when I was taking care of you. You know, putting myself in your shoes, trying to do my best in every aspect, even fanning you with strength."
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been reading nearby, couldn't hold back and laughed out loud.
 

 
The Consort grabbed another feather fan and tossed it at his head, laughing and scolding, "Making a fool of me, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi reacted quickly and easily caught the fan. He walked over to Wei Zekai, signaling him to step aside, and then changed the fanning method to a softer, gentler motion: "You said you were taking care of a pregnant Tong Zhao... well, you really need to learn. The wind from just now won’t do."
 

 
Wei Zekai watched him for a moment.
 

 
The fan was light, and the breeze it created was gentle.
 

 
Wei Zekai tentatively asked:
 

 
"Brother Zhi, did you forget to eat?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
His brother Zhi really wanted to smack the rice bowl onto his forehead.
# Chapter141: Variety Show Special (4) – “If You Dare Say ‘Drink More Hot Water,’ You’re Done For…”
In just half a day, Wei Zekai fully understood the deeper meaning behind Brother Zhi’s comment, “You really know how to pick a door to open.”
 

 
The imperial concubine was truly a master at delegating tasks.
 

 
Running up and down, serving tea and pouring water, was just the basics.
 

 
When it came to giving massages, he almost sent Her Majesty into a state of bliss right then and there.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s utter lack of caregiving skills surprised everyone. Some viewers in the bullet comments speculated it was because he was a super-rich second-generation heir, raised in a life of luxury where everything was handed to him on a silver platter. Having even the awareness to take care of someone was already a feat for him.
 

 
But then the question arose: if Tong Zhao were ever really pregnant, could he handle it?
 

 
[If he casually spends just a little, he could hire 100 nannies, each assigned to care for one of Tong Zhao's fingers.]
 

 
[...The previous comment is so accurate. I'm envious.]
 

 
[So having money really makes it easier to be a "good man." Laughing but also agreeing.]
 

 
When Han Zhi asked the same question, the concubine herself wasn’t worried. She shared the same view as the bullet comments—he’s rich enough to hire people to take care of everything. Her husband only needs to manage the kingdom, keep her entertained when present, and swipe his card for endless shopping sprees.
 

 
After all, back in the palace, there was no reason for the emperor to personally care for pregnant women.
 

 
Specialized skills belong to professionals; leave it to the experts.
 

 
Even the ever-critical and picky concubine didn’t think this approach meant slacking off.
 

 
The audience was in stitches, joking that it was fortunate this was just one of Tong Zhao's passing thoughts. Otherwise, how could she have produced so many great works? She would’ve retired from the industry long ago and gotten married.
 

 
But that’s not entirely true.
 

 
The concubine has an exceptional eye for men, and even someone as wealthy as Wei Zekai isn’t her idea of “the best.” Without power in his hands, he still falls short. She’d rather stick to acting, though her roles might be limited to playing heartthrobs and femme fatales. Even so, in an era dominated by pure cinema, she’d still shine brightly, become the queen of genre films, and captivate countless elites vying for her attention.
 

 
Han Zhi was convinced by her reasoning.
 

 
“I hadn’t thought of it that way,” Wei Zekai admitted, looking confused. “If Tong Zhao had plans for children, of course I’d hire help. But I’d also arrange my work in advance… I’ve heard pregnancy is like being ill. When your girlfriend’s sick, how can you not stay by her side?”
 

 
“So you’d take care of her personally?”
 

 
“Of course. I’ll handle all three meals and midnight snacks too—no problem.”
 

 
Wei Zekai patted his chest in assurance.
 

 
Some viewers found this incredibly sweet.
 

 
In reality shows like Instinct, people often reveal their true selves. Some even become more straightforward than usual.
 

 
Wei Zekai was speaking sincerely.
 

 
However, viewers who had watched ‘Sea King’ joked in the bullet comments not to have unrealistic expectations about Wei "Dog" taking over all three meals. Given his cooking skills, they’d already be grateful if he didn’t blow up the kitchen or give the pregnant woman food poisoning. It’s better for him to focus on earning money to support the family—being a househusband just isn’t for him.
 

 
After some playful back-and-forth in the comments, the consensus was:
 

 
[A+ for effort. On behalf of Sister Zhao and the baby, we appreciate the thought.]
 

 
---
 

 
In the afternoon, the concubine grew tired and sent the two men away, saying she’d rest for a while and call them if needed.
 

 
A young woman in full traditional attire casually saying she’d "call someone"…
 

 
The scene felt so jarringly modern it resembled a time-travel drama.
 

 
Viewers were reluctant to part ways; they wanted to see more of Tong Zhao in her ancient costume. There was a special kind of delight in being bossed around by a beauty like her. Plus, the concubine “rewarded” her servants as she worked them—without showing even an inch of skin, her fleeting glances, teasing smiles, and feigned annoyance were visual treats, a feast for the eyes like having ice cream.
 

 
In one scene, Wei Zekai fanned her too vigorously, directing the breeze straight into the concubine’s face and making the corners of her eyes turn red.
 

 
The bullet comments were stunned:
 

 
[Wait—is this really free to watch?]
 
[I take back everything I said about Wei the rich kid. Please fan harder, thanks.]
 

 
Wei Zekai hadn’t meant to cause trouble, and he wasn’t dumb. After being scolded by the concubine twice, he quickly learned the correct way to serve his girlfriend. Female viewers sighed enviously over his evolution into the ultimate attentive boyfriend. But to Concubine Chen, he was nothing more than:
 

 
“Barely passable.”
 

 
It really isn’t easy to please Sister Concubine!
 

 
So, what could Wei Zekai and Han Zhi possibly do when left alone together?
 

 
At this moment, the show cut to an interview segment from Shi Qianqiu’s omniscient perspective:
 

 
"If you were to spend time alone with Tong Zhao’s boyfriend, what would you want to do?"
 

 
Even without seeing his face, viewers instantly recognized the sly and unmistakably sarcastic voice of Shi Qianqiu. The bullet comments lit up with jokes:
 

 
[Fake dog: Wei “Dog.” Real dog: Shi Qianqiu.]
 

 
In the interview, Han Zhi’s expression turned momentarily blank with confusion before he replied:
 

 
"There’s nothing I’d want to do... Just hope he cherishes Tong Zhao. She’s been through a lot."
 

 
After finishing his sentence, Han Zhi paused, his gaze lowering slightly:
 

 
"It’s never been easy."
 

 
---
 

 
Having no particular plans, Han Zhi took Wei Zekai to his room.
 

 
This room was starkly different from the one he used during live streams with his female fans. It was truly his personal space, one that mirrored his room within Tong Zhao's "Palace of Consciousness." The room was minimalist to the extreme, almost devoid of a lived-in feel. No decorations, no unnecessary furniture, and not even a trace of clutter on the desk. The room was dominated by a black-and-white color scheme, its only exception being a half-burned scented candle on the nightstand, the sole hint that someone actually lived there.
 

 
Han Zhi sat down on the bed.
 

 
Noticing there weren’t any chairs, Wei Zekai didn’t feel like standing to chat, so after a brief moment of consideration, he casually sat down on the floor.
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips curved slightly, almost imperceptibly.
 

 
AI captured his inner thoughts: "I was actually thinking of inviting him to sit next to me... Oh well, never mind."
 

 
Han Zhi had a face that exuded deep emotion. But when listening to his inner monologue, one could occasionally sense traces of aloof detachment.
 

 
Wei Zekai attempted to start a conversation. "Your room... It’s decorated in quite a unique way, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, his lashes casting shadows that added a hint of melancholy to his expression. "There was a time when I experienced gender dysphoria."
 

 
There was a fleeting moment of silence, heavy with unspoken context.
 

 
In the past, BL novels featuring gender-swapped protagonists were popular, where the lead characters cheerfully adapted to their new male forms to engage in romantic adventures. But for Tong Zhao's soul, trapped in a male body, things weren’t so simple or joyous. Han Zhi endured a long period of self-doubt, eventually channeling the admiration from his fans as his sole source of validation.
 

 
To Han Zhi, gender became irrelevant. It didn’t matter who he was, or who others saw him as. His entourage of bodyguards and adoring fans served as his protective shield.
 

 
He was a perfect celebrity, so flawless he seemed almost unreal.
 

 
Learning to let go and enjoy life came much later.
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was calm but tinged with residual vulnerability. "Having extra furniture makes it harder for me to sleep."
 

 
"When did this happen?"
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, his tone filled with urgency.
 

 
Tong Zhao had never mentioned it to him.
 

 
Han Zhi immediately pinpointed the source of his worry and chuckled. "She doesn’t like complaining to others."
 

 
She excelled at comforting others, but when she was in pain, she preferred to grit her teeth and endure it silently.
 

 
Han Zhi paused briefly, suppressing a wave of discomfort. As someone who shared the same soul as Tong Zhao, he too disliked airing grievances unless it was to gain sympathy or to emotionally connect with fans. When he did show his vulnerability, it was often a calculated move.
 

 
He said softly, "You’re in a relationship with her, so take the initiative to care for her. If she says nothing’s wrong, just give her a hug."
 

 
"The Noble Concubine's evaluation of you is that you're a late-stage, hopeless straight-laced guy. Your saving grace? You're obedient and easy to command," Han Zhi quipped with a knowing smile.
 

 
"I can teach you how to make her happy."
 

 
Faced with this self-proclaimed relationship expert, Wei Zekai looked stunned.
 

 
Male viewers commented in the livestream:
 

 
[Master, teach me too! Is this valuable knowledge available for free?]
 

 
Female viewers, however, were far more straightforward:
 

 
[I want Han Zhi to make me happy too! Hug Han Zhi!]
 
[It works the other way too. I want to make Han Zhi happy!]
 

 
Some even coined a mock title:
 

 
"Han Zhi’s Guide to Pleasing Your Girlfriend 101."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised his hand nervously. "What should I do when my girlfriend’s on her period?"
 

 
Han Zhi smiled faintly, his expression serene and elegant. "Why don’t you tell me what you’d do first?"
 

 
However, the content scanned by the AI was: "Anyone who says 'drink more hot water' should be buried."
 

 
[Hahaha, "drink more hot water" is so real!]
 
[I think he just read Wei Zekai's mind.]
 

 
Some viewers were confused: [Isn't it bad to be cold during your period? What's wrong with drinking hot water?]
 

 
"Drink... drink... brown sugar water?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Han Zhi: [It's hard now.]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Han Zhi, what are you doing?]
 

 
[Is this really allowed to air???]
 

 
Han Zhi: [My fist is hard now.]
 

 
[......]
 

 
[Alright, Han Zhi, you're amazing.]
 

 
[You AI machines, don't breathe so loudly, damn it!]
 

 
Han Zhi went on, saying everything that needed to be said, then added: "Some influencer accounts show videos of good men saying sweet words, but the truth is every woman is different. If she doesn’t say she wants to hear a story, it’s better to say less. If she’s in pain and sweating, wipe it off for her. If she’s cold and uncomfortable, give her a hug, let her know you're there and that you're patient. Don’t ask if she’s feeling better, she can't control when she'll feel better... Anyway, let me demonstrate."
 

 
On the bed, he pulled the stunned Wei Zekai (pretending to be the "period version of a dog") into his arms, patted his head, and lowered his voice slightly: "Anyway, I won’t leave even when you get better. Rest well, I’m staying with you."
 

 
[How much would this "immersive Wei Zekai experience" cost to buy?!]
 

 
[I’m so jealous of this guy who not only got my sister but is also being hugged by my brother!!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was envied and resented by fans, eagerly asked, “Should I memorize this sentence?”
 

 
“No need, when you’re in a relationship, don’t overthink it. Don’t memorize lines.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, “Here, I’ll give you a chance for a practical lesson. If I’m uncomfortable during my period, what would you do?”
 

 
From the god’s perspective, Shi Qianqiu understood everything and immediately switched to Wei Zekai’s view, letting the audience clearly see Han Zhi clutching his abdomen, his brow furrowed in agony. The handsome guy’s suffering, combined with an oddly alluring expression, was fully displayed for the audience to see—
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath.
 

 
[Don’t memorize lines…] he reminded himself.
 

 
“I’m here.”
 

 
He said, taking Han Zhi’s hand and reassuringly squeezing it. “I feel for you, let me hug you.”
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
[…Damn! ]
 

 
All the viewers could hear his exasperated, curse-laced thought.
 

 
Han Zhi’s initial discomfort had been fake.
 

 
Now, it was real.
 

 
Wei Zekai, completely unaware that he had triggered Han Zhi’s sensitive spot, was still reviewing and learning: “Tong Zhao never tells me when she’s on her period, so I don’t have any practical experience. You can act it out with me a few more times.”
 

 
Han Zhi quickly retreated three arms' length away and raised his hand to signal him to stop.
 

 
He said, "I just remembered something."
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly asked, "What is it?"
 

 
Han Zhi: "...She doesn't have menstrual cramps.”
# Chapter142: Variety Show Extra (5) The One You Love Doesn’t Need to Be Tested...
It was time for the bi-daily summary interview.
 

 
In the live broadcast, the audience saw Wei Zekai, who had been tormented by the Concubine for two days, walking into the confessional room with a tired expression. Inside the room, there was no priest, only a floating light orb.
 

 
"Hello..."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at the light orb with some doubt.
 

 
"Hello."
 

 
The synthesized male voice, altered through sound modulation, sounded a little ethereal.
 

 
Narrator: At this moment, our protagonist, Wei Zekai, still doesn’t know the true identity of the host behind the scenes!
 

 
"After these two days of... torment, ah no, I mean, getting to know each other, what are your feelings?" the host asked.
 

 
"You just said torment, right? I definitely heard you say torment!"
 

 
"Please share your thoughts."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Aren’t you going to explain what you mean by 'torment'?"
 

 
The man and the orb stared at each other for a moment.
 

 
The host orb sighed slowly, then seriously explained, "Of course not! Our show's goal is to help you understand your girlfriend in a warm and loving way.”
 

 
Wei Zekai sat down on the chair, still finding it hard to let go of his wariness toward the light orb.
 

 
But since it was a requirement of the show, he could only be honest.
 

 
"So, it turns out Tong Zhao has such a demanding side. How should I put it? You might think it’s torment, but as long as I think of her as Tong Zhao, seeing that face that’s exactly like hers..." Once he started talking, Wei Zekai was actually quite honest and easy to coax. His cheeks flushed slightly, and he seemed a bit shy. "I actually enjoy being bossed around by her. She doesn’t usually ask for help, and she doesn’t rely on me, so when she does ask me to do something, it feels good."
 

 
Hearing this, the light orb seemed to shrink for a moment.
 

 
For some reason, Wei Zekai had the feeling that this inorganic being was holding back laughter.
 

 
The comments were laughing the hardest:
 

 
[It’s just the Concubine's task.]
 

 
"So, do you think this experience has been helpful to you?" the host orb continued.
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded. "From now on, I’ll know how to take care of her even before she opens her mouth."
 

 
A round of synthesized cheers and applause followed.
 

 
The host orb said, "Congratulations, you’ve become an excellent tool person!"
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail swished irritably a few times, and he muttered under his breath, "I don’t know why, but whenever I hear you speak, I feel this annoying familiarity, you remind me of someone I really don’t like..."
 

 
"That really hurts my feelings. This is our first meeting," the host orb sighed dramatically.
 

 
"Is that so? Sorry, I must have been overthinking."
 

 
"No need to mind, I'm not the petty type."
 

 
The host orb watched as Wei Zekai left.
 

 
The comments were full of reactions, with viewers exclaiming that Wei Zekai wasn't the dog at all.
 

 
The real dog was clearly the director.
 

 
From the viewers' god’s-eye view, it was clear that the one controlling the light orb and talking to Wei Zekai was Shi Qianqiu, who was sitting in the director’s chair backstage. Today, he wasn’t dressed in his usual tropical wind look, but instead wore a casual bunny-themed coral fleece pajama with bunny ears on his hat.
 

 
As Wei Zekai left the confession room, Shi Qianqiu winked at the camera, causing a surge of excitement among viewers, especially those with a fondness for good looks.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu sighed with enthusiasm: "I can't wait for the show to air!"
 

 
[Stop acting cute, Old Thief Shi.]
 

 
[Help, is this the legendary 'disgustingly handsome'?]
 

 
[My heart aches for the Dog for a second.]
 

 
＊
 

 
The second pair was Lu Xianchang and Zhao Zai.
 

 
Although it was unexpected, the personality that got along best with Zhao Zai was indeed Lu Xianchang. Every time Zhao Zai was bullied by the Concubine, she would cry and rush into Lu Xianchang's arms.
 

 
Perhaps because Lu Xianchang knew Wei Zekai had been tormented by the Concubine earlier, her attitude toward him, as someone who strongly resisted men, had softened.
 

 
His job was to play with Zhao Zai.
 

 
In the colorful children's room filled with toys, Lu Xianchang spent time playing various little games with Zhao Zai, which for the wealthy Wei Zekai...
 

 
...was simply heaven!
 

 
The younger version of Tong Zhao was just too adorable.
 

 
After Wei Zekai helped Zhao Zai build a small castle with blocks, he stared at her round little face and couldn't help but sigh, "You know, if I had met you when I was in elementary school, how great would that have been?"
 

 
Zhao Zai, feeling his gaze, defensively clenched the blocks in her hand.
 

 
Wei Zekai gently patted her head, "I wish I had met you earlier."
 

 
At every stage of life, he wanted to go through it with her.
 

 
Zhao Zai nuzzled his palm, and with her bright, clear eyes, she looked intently at this older brother, making Wei Zekai’s heart melt.
 

 
Lu Xianchang asked him why he was staring at the child.
 

 
Without hesitation, Wei Zekai replied, "I want our future kids to look just like their mom."
 

 
Lu Xianchang: "..."
 

 
Crazy.
 

 
The audience saw the elegant, goddess-like figure of Lu Xianchang give an expression of disdain, maximizing the show’s effect.
 

 
The host orb, acting as the representative of the viewers, asked Lu Xianchang, who had always acted so dismissive of men, what she thought of Wei Zekai. She replied:
 

 
"My opinion? What opinion could I have?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang gave the orb a faint glance, as if already seeing through the true identity behind the light ball. Her almond-shaped eyes glinted with coldness. Though her eyes were the same shape as Tong Zhao's, they looked even more distant, pushing people away with an air of aloofness.
 

 
It was as though she was friendly to women, but only in comparison to men. Overall, regardless of gender, she kept a distance from people. "By becoming my independent subconscious, I am preserving Tong Zhao's right to love others. Whoever she loves is good."
 

 
In this fantastical world, after the trauma she witnessed and the profound shock it brought, she found it difficult to get close to anyone.
 

 
The system separated her into a different persona, allowing Tong Zhao to later become a more "normal" person.
 

 
The host orb mischievously stirred the pot: "What if he's not good to her?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang placed her slender, pale hand on her sword—
 

 
"Execute him."
 

 
Narration special effects text: [I really want to see the male lead's head roll.]
 

 
As soon as this line of effects appeared, another popped up: [Director, this is broadcast content, you can't send bullet comments!]
 

 
[—Please forget the previous two lines!]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Shi Qianqiu, stop sending bullet comments!]
 

 
[Stop bullying Wei Zekai!]
 

 
[Well done! I mean, increase the intensity.]
 

 
In this variety show, Wei Zekai might as well be the one with his head rolling.
 

 
He said he wanted to understand Duan Ge, so Duan Ge sat for a while, smoked two cigarettes, and in the end, it was Wei Zekai who quietly said that smoking was bad for the health, which made Duan Ge put out the cigarette. The host orb floated into the living room and suggested, "Maybe a fight would help you understand each other."
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t respond, and Wei Zekai thought that was fine.
 

 
The bullet comments were in a panic:
 

 
[Wei Zekai, ahead is hell!]
 

 
[Help, this episode should be renamed ‘Shi Qianqiu’s Daily Dog Torture’!]
 

 
[Torturing dogs is illegal, Director Shi! Actually, you just want to see him get beaten, right?]
 

 
As the audience expected, Wei Zekai was completely outmatched—he was in full protective gear for the ring fight, and although it didn’t look violent, he wasn’t seriously hurt. He only had minor bruises where he had been hit. Duan Ge thought the kid was kind of cute, so he went easy on him, letting him land a few punches. After feeling the punches, Duan Ge was a bit impressed with how seriously he fought.
 

 
When Duan Ge and Shuyi were together, it seemed like Wei Zekai was living in two extremes.
 

 
Shuyi took Wei Zekai, who had been knocked out, to rest for a while, then brought him to the library in the castle.
 

 
This library didn’t have actual books but was a collection of Tong Zhao’s memory fragments.
 

 
“These are memories from a long time ago,”
 

 
Shuyi picked up a dusty book and opened it, revealing a photo inside.
 

 
The audience saw it was a younger version of Wei Zekai, hurriedly walking toward "himself."
 

 
“Fortunately, it was me who caught the basketball. He apologized to me, promising not to make the same mistake again.”
 

 
“He’s good-looking, but he’s a bit foolish.”
 

 
The second photo showed Wei Zekai, after noticing she was unwell, handing her a Coke and painkillers.
 

 
“I got my period, and he bought me a Coke, calling it ‘fatty’s happy drink...’” Shuyi placed her hand on the book, feeling Tong Zhao’s emotions from that time, imitating her helpless tone.
 

 
“Forget it.”
 

 
“Why do people think he’s scary? He’s really so silly.”
 

 
There were many more, all of them memories of the two of them.
 

 
“I didn’t want to test you—Tong Zhao likes you. What I want to do is just teach you how to understand her,” Shuyi said gently. She resembled Tong Zhao in both her eyes and brows, carrying a warm, compassionate air. “She’s as complicated as this castle, but she doesn’t want to be like this. Can you give her a little patience?”
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded.
 

 
He said, "I feel like I could stay here for the rest of my life."
 

 
＊
 

 
"I really don't understand why you want to stay with me."
 

 
Iya, who had been assigned to live with Tong Zhao, had a cold, ethereal expression on her face.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled gently, wrapping her arms around her and hanging on her like a koala: "God loves everyone, Sister Iya."
 

 
The saintess furrowed her brows, clearly annoyed.
 

 
She knew what the next arrangements would be, so she said, "I have no interest in your little lover. You don't need to show him to me. Who you choose to be with is none of my business."
 

 
Sister Saintess was so hard to please.
 

 
However, when Wei Zekai entered the room, it was just after he had been beaten up by Duan Ge again, a large bruise on his left temple making him look pitiful. After greeting the two of them, Iya waved her hand impatiently: "Come here."
 

 
Wei Zekai, confused, but having learned a lesson over the past few days, knew one important thing.
 

 
That was, whatever his girlfriend said was absolute.
 

 
He had to listen.
 

 
He walked over, but was stopped just one step away. He heard the blindfolded girl say in a disgusted tone, "Don't get too close to me."
 

 
She called him over, but also didn’t want him too close.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail drooped pitifully.
 

 
However, the next moment, that cool little hand rested on his head and patted it.
 

 
A cool sensation settled on his forehead, and the pain from his injury vanished in an instant.
 

 
When Wei Zekai, surprised, raised his head again, the girl in front of him was gone. Only the Tong Zhao he knew best remained. She pinched his cheek, pretending to be jealous, and said with a smile, "How unfair, she doesn’t treat me well, but why can’t she stand seeing you hurt?"
 

 
"I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to!" Thinking his girlfriend was upset, Wei Zekai wagged his tail furiously, "I didn’t do anything!"
 

 
At that moment, a voice from the director explained:
 

 
[All of Tong Zhao’s subconscious likes and dislikes will shift according to her will.]
 

 
[So, what you're saying is, Xiao Zhao is being tsundere.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Director Shi even ruins Sister Zhao’s stage while being a tease!]
 

 
[Director Shi has gone mad.]
 

 
Just like Shuyi and Lu Xianchang said, there is no such thing as a test.
 

 
The person you love doesn't need to be tested, and neither does the relationship.
 

 
What matters is not wanting them to suffer or feel pain, but the steady, continuous care and love.
