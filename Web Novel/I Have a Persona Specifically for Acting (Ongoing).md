# Chapter1
"Transmigrated again?”
 

 
This was the first thought that came to Tong Zhao’s mind when she opened her eyes.
 

 
Ever since she died in a car accident at the age of twenty-four, Tong Zhao had acquired a quick transmigration system. Her soul had completed arduous tasks in many different worlds, and she had long been used to opening her eyes after death, accepting a new identity, and facing new challenges.
 

 
As she sat up to observe her surroundings, she called out to the system.
 

 
Tong Zhao was in a simple, small room. Apart from the bed and a dining table, there wasn’t any extra furniture. Fortunately, there was a private bathroom, so she didn’t have to share it with other tenants. But as for cooking, that was out of the question; there was no gas stove.
 

 
Faced with this predicament, Tong Zhao actually laughed.
 

 
It seems this mission won’t be too difficult.
 

 
After all, the last time she woke up, her soul board was shattered, her four limbs were pierced by Immortal Locking Nails, and she was hung in a heavily guarded water dungeon. Compared to that, this modern world, even with a bit of poverty, was practically a vacation for her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, what is the mission this time?]
 

 
There was a dead silence in her mind—no synthesized mechanical voice answered her question.
 

 
This had never happened before.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mind was filled with suspicion, but an arrogant and spoiled female voice sounded from outside the door: 'Tong Zhao, I've come to see you.'
 

 
The sound of her name hit Tong Zhao like a bolt of lightning!
 

 
How long had it been since someone called her by that name? She had once been the favored Noble Consort Chen of the Six Palaces, Duan Ge who fought her way through the apocalypse, and Lu Xianzhang, who executed the scumbag that killed his wife to achieve enlightenment... Besides the system addressing her as Tong Zhao, she had almost forgotten her original name.
 

 
And this long-lost, familiar female voice brought a flood of memories associated with this body rushing back to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t transmigrated again.
 

 
She had transmigrated back.
 

 
Back to her most helpless and lost eighteen-year-old self.
 

 
It was half a year after her mother’s death, and her father couldn’t wait to bring his mistress, Xu Xinya, and her illegitimate daughter back into the house because the mistress was pregnant with the long-awaited grandson of the Tong family. Overwhelmed, Tong Zhao ran away from home, vowing that even if she starved to death on the streets, she would never have anything to do with that family again.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother had once been a famous film actress, and Xu Xinya was her assistant, as close as a sister.
 

 
When Tong Zhao’s mother was pregnant and it was inconvenient for the couple to have marital relations, Xu Xinya used the excuse of taking good care of her 'close friend' to get close to Tong Zhao's father, and the two of them began their illicit affair in the mansion. One thing led to another, and Xu Xinya ended up pregnant with a child of the Tong family, secretly kept outside.
 

 
Unaware of any of this, Tong Zhao’s mother thought her friend had been deceived by a scumbag, getting pregnant out of wedlock. Out of compassion, she provided financial and emotional support for the mistress. Xu Xinya, in turn, shamelessly took advantage of her kindness to continue her affair with Tong Zhao’s father.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao's mother fell seriously ill, Xu Xinya, thinking her time had come, secretly revealed the truth to her by the bedside. This truth severely shocked her, who should have been calmly recuperating, and the double betrayal from both her husband and her friend utterly broke her. She did not survive the coldest winter in Jiangcheng.
 

 
Since she was a child, Tong Zhao has idolized her mother and dreamed of becoming a big star. However, after her mother's death, everything changed. The girl's angry accusations only made her guilty father fly into a rage out of shame. This allowed her stepmother and stepsister to take advantage of the situation and take everything away from her—no living expenses, no place to stay, and all the resources shifted toward the stepsister who also dreamed of becoming a star...
 

 
Outside the door, the chatter continued incessantly:
 

 
'Stop pretending to be dead. I know you're in there. Didn't you say you wanted to sever ties with the Tong family? At least take the things you left at home with you! Look how nice I am, driving over to bring them to you myself.'
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, the one barking outside is her stepsister, Xu Zhu.
 

 
A name her cheap father chose, meaning ‘the lost pearl of the sea.’
 

 
Xu Zhu made this special trip to see her, with two main goals:
 

 
One, to feel reassured that Tong Zhao wasn’t doing well.
 

 
Two, to kick her while she’s down, to ruthlessly beat a drowning dog.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu had always envied Tong Zhao for living openly in the mansion. Seeing the young lady fall from grace and live a life worse than hers was a scene worth traveling across mountains and rivers to witness. Back then, the eighteen-year-old Tong Zhao obliged, showing her enemy's daughter her most broken and desperate side, crying and yelling at her to get lost.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, 'Just woke up. Give me a moment.'”
 

 
It immediately became quiet outside the door.
 

 
Xu Zhu really wanted to see what her stepsister looked like now.
 

 
If she had to wait, she was willing to wait.
 

 
Back then, she had lain on the bed like a dying dog for several days, tossing and turning as she mourned her deceased mother, filled with hatred but powerless to change anything. Fortunately, after crying herself out, her eyes weren’t swollen at the moment, just her complexion was a bit pale. Tong Zhao rummaged through her bag and took out a makeup kit. With her slender fingers moving quickly, she applied a base makeup and put on a bright lipstick.
 

 
After just five minutes, the person outside couldn’t wait any longer. 'Tong Zhao, I warn you not to leave me hanging out here. If you hate me or feel resentful, then open the door and say it to my face! Are you too scared to even face your own sister…'
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door.
 

 
The voice outside stopped abruptly, and Xu Zhu froze.
 

 
Standing before her, Tong Zhao was wrapped in a silk nightgown, her slightly curled black hair cascading over her shoulders and forehead. Her exposed skin was as delicate and fair as the first snow. The bold lipstick color accentuated the girl's features, making her look even more coldly beautiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her almond-shaped eyes and smiled without a hint of warmth.
 

 
'Speak.'
 

 
…
 

 
Xu Zhu was more than just speechless; she could barely breathe.
 

 
Just two days ago, Xu Zhu had seen Tong Zhao in the living room, having a breakdown while shouting and cursing at her father, then crying as she stormed out of the house. That scene was still fresh in her mind and had been so thrilling that she felt it wasn’t enough. She wanted a classic reenactment, to personally experience the pleasure of kicking someone when they’re down.
 

 
What happened to being down and out?
 

 
What happened to a mental breakdown?
 

 
Both of them took after their mothers.
 

 
One inherited the looks of an actress, while the other resembled the actress's assistant, and the difference in their beauty was immediately apparent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s beauty was very well-proportioned. From her brow arch down to the perfectly shaped bridge of her nose, her features created a face that could withstand scrutiny from any angle. At first glance, it was clear she was a well-educated young lady from a wealthy family. At this moment, Tong Zhao’s presence was overwhelming; her beauty carried a tangible aura that completely overshadowed Xu Zhu.
 

 
Xu Zhu managed to find her voice again. 'T-Tong Zhao, Auntie hasn’t been gone for long... and you’re already wearing makeup?'
 

 
Although she stuttered a bit, she knew the other person had been through so much misery lately that there was no need to think hard to find a weak spot—one poke would hit the sore point. But unfortunately for her, the person standing before her was no longer the pitiful child who would explode at the mention of her mother. Tong Zhao, who had served as an overseer of the Samsara Mirror in a cultivation world, no longer felt sorrow over her deceased mother—only hatred remained.
 

 
The revenge she owed would not be left unpaid.
 

 
But the jokes her enemies had laughed at before—this time, there would be none.
 

 
"My mom loved to see me looking beautiful. Keeping this beauty she passed on to me well-maintained is the best tribute to her," Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her gaze cold as water falling on Xu Zhu's merely delicate face. She curled her lips into a mocking smile, "Where are the things you brought for me? Hand them over."
 

 
Under the command-like tone of her words, Xu Zhu obediently handed over a large bag of clothes.
 

 
Once her hands were free, Xu Zhu suddenly realized—
 

 
Why was she being so obedient?
 

 
She had come to humiliate Tong Zhao; how could she behave like she used to, obeying her?
 

 
That’s right, back when she was trying to make a living in the Tong family, Xu Zhu had followed her mother’s advice to curry favor with the legitimate young lady, becoming good friends with the original Tong Zhao. Under Xu Xinya’s teachings, she believed that women’s friendships were only for leveraging resources and that it was all about selling at the best value.
 

 
Not only did she want to sell out her friend, but she also resented that Tong Zhao's life was better than hers.
 

 
Truly a champion among traitors.
 

 
"Tong Zhao!" Xu Zhu, ashamed and angry, gritted her teeth at her. "Do you still think you're the eldest daughter of the Tong family? My mom went for a checkup last week, and this time, she's pregnant with a boy. Even if you went back and apologized to Dad, it wouldn't matter. There's no place for you in the Tong family anymore."
 

 
After throwing out this harsh remark, Xu Zhu, still suffocated by Tong Zhao’s beauty, finally felt a bit more satisfied.
 

 
Tong Zhao listened quietly to her rant, and a genuine emotion touched the corners of her smiling lips.
 

 
From Xu Zhu's perspective, she could only see Tong Zhao's captivating eyes, unable to discern the emotions behind her bright red smile. It seemed to carry both mockery and pity, like looking down at a pest chasing crumbs on the ground.
 

 
"From the moment Tong Zhenming betrayed his wife, I ceased to be part of the Tong family. You and your mother have spent half your lives scraping and clawing, discarding morality, dignity, and friendship just to squeeze through that door..."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was cold and lazy, with a hint of a raspy, amused chuckle.
 

 
Even while insulting her, there was a seductive allure in her voice.
 

 
"Sorry, but I find it filthy to even spare you another glance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile faded as she calmly closed the door with her slender, pale hand. She then called the building's security downstairs, saying there was an unfamiliar person causing trouble outside her door and asked them to remove her. In China, there is a great emphasis on public security. An apartment complex may be old, but it must have a certain number of security personnel.
 

 
'Tong Zhao, get out here! What are you pretending to be so noble for? You’re living in this dump. You’re nothing without the Tong family! I’m going to tell Dad what you said, and don’t even think about getting any resources from my family...'
 

 
Sure enough, when the security arrived on the 13th floor, they saw Xu Zhu, angrily kicking the door in high heels and yelling.
 

 
Without much fuss, she was immediately treated as someone causing trouble and escorted away.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s words were half true.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was like a flower in a greenhouse. After leaving the Tong family, she couldn't compete with those who had connections above her, nor could she fight those with tough backgrounds and high emotional intelligence below her. The only advantage she had was a connection her mother had set up for her before she died — the lead director of the TV drama *The Legend of Emperor Ming* was a fan of her mother and, as a favor, gave Tong Zhao a role as a minor concubine, one of the female extras.
 

 
But her past self hadn’t made the most of that single opportunity.
 

 
Due to the nature of holographic filming, actors cannot retain their own consciousness; they can only perform by instinct, fused with the personality of the characters they are implanted with. Therefore, holographic films are also called 'instinctive films.' Most young idols have little life experience, let alone the dramatic experiences of the characters in the movies. The resulting performances often seem superficial, and audiences have grown accustomed to these lackluster performances.
 

 
After being humiliated and provoked by her stepsister, Tong Zhao fell into severe emotional problems. The concubine she played in the film didn’t exude the seductive charm of a femme fatale; instead, audiences only saw a pitiful and panicked girl.
 

 
Those who cared about her were pained, while those who resented her were delighted. Tong Zhao never got another role and watched helplessly as her stepsister gained fame and fortune.
 

 
But this time, having come back…
 

 
Tong Zhao walked to the mirror and studied her face, recalling the first world she had transmigrated into.
 

 
In an ancient time, she was a fox spirit tasked with hastening the downfall of a tyrant—a favored imperial concubine named Chen Guifei. Every official's memorial to the emperor had to begin by praising the emperor and then extolling Chen Guifei's beauty; otherwise, it would be considered a grave offense.
 

 
The more favored she was, the more absurd it became.
 

 
In that instant before the mirror, the thoughts and feelings of Chen Guifei throughout her life flowed through Tong Zhao's entire being.
 

 
Tong Zhao realized that not only could she recall the personalities she had embodied in the past, but she could also wield them at will!
# Chapter2
At the same time.
 

 
While Tong Zhao was exploring her newfound "cheat ability," Xu Zhu, who had been politely but firmly escorted out of the neighborhood by the security guards, got into a luxury car with an unhappy expression. After closing the car door behind her, she took out her phone from her designer handbag and dialed Tong Zhao's father's number.
 

 
Suppressing her anger, she complained in a sweet voice, "Dad, I took my sister's things over to return them and told her that there will always be a place for her at home. I asked her to come back as soon as she got over it. I even said I could move out if it comes to that..."
 

 
"How could we let you move out? Xinya is pregnant with your little brother, and I’m busy with work. She has no relatives to take care of her," Tong Zhenming replied dismissively.
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt reassured and continued to stir things up: "I really had no choice. Sister is still angry and won't forgive me. She said she would never be a part of the Tong family again, and she even said..."
 

 
She hesitated, as if unsure whether to continue.
 

 
"What else did your sister say?"
 

 
Tong Zhenming took the bait as expected.
 

 
He always positioned himself as the head of the family and was very annoyed when women and younger family members disobeyed him.
 

 
He didn’t mind a bit of whining or pouting, even if he might have done something wrong. After all, he had apologized! And yet, Tong Zhao dared to point at him and accuse him of being disrespectful in his old age. That girl ate his food and lived under his roof. In his view, no parent is ever truly wrong, and it was not her place to criticize him.
 

 
With his eldest daughter running away from home, Tong Zhenming felt his authority was being challenged. He decided she needed to learn a lesson — to realize that without his protection, she was nothing and could accomplish nothing. The once spoiled princess would be taught by harsh reality and would eventually come back to apologize. All he needed to do was sit tight and wait.
 

 
This was the confident educational insight of a middle-aged man.
 

 
Therefore, Tong Zhenming tacitly allowed his younger daughter to find out where Tong Zhao was living, to see if she had reflected on her actions after a week away from home.
 

 
"Sister also said that she thinks you're filthy and that even looking at you makes her feel dirty. If Auntie had known what kind of person you were, she would never have been with you. After all, plenty of wealthy young men pursued Auntie, and if she wasn't in poor health, she could have remarried anytime, even with Sister in tow..."
 

 
Xu Zhu said timidly.
 

 
She used the most cowardly and innocent tone to spin her little narrative.
 

 
Xu Zhu knew that her father’s proudest achievement was that the famous actress Tong Zhao's mother had favored him among many suitors. He was also very sensitive about the admiration his wife received both before and after their marriage. Even though she had retired from acting and rarely saw outsiders, it still bothered him deeply. Tong Zhenming had complained about this to his mistress many times, and Xu Zhu, having seen and heard all this, knew exactly how to hit his sore spots.
 

 
"Dream on!" Tong Zhenming erupted in anger, trembling with rage. "I raised that ungrateful girl for nothing. Would she be where she is without me? Thinks I'm filthy? Fine, even if she dies out there, I won’t care anymore! She wants to be a star? I had connections lined up for her... Forget it. It’s not like I, Tong Zhenming, only have one daughter. If she doesn’t want to acknowledge me as her father, there are plenty of others who’d kneel just for the chance to call me Dad!"
 

 
Xu Zhu was overjoyed. "But..."
 

 
—
 

 
The father enjoyed making harsh statements.
 

 
The daughter felt that calling him "Dad" while kneeling was worth it.
 

 
Both father and daughter felt that Tong Zhao had greatly underestimated her losses and was in for a rough time.
 

 
“Stop defending your sister. I know what I’m doing. Remember not to tell your mother about this; I don’t want her to be upset.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming impatiently reassured his daughter, ending the conversation with a commanding tone.
 

 
With her father’s promise not to interfere with Tong Zhao anymore, Xu Zhu felt much better and decided to immediately relay the details of the call to her mother. She hoped that even her pregnancy symptoms might improve and that she could enjoy a couple more bowls of rice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn’t disappoint Xu Zhu. He efficiently arranged for his younger daughter to participate in a girl group training program centered on youth and growth. With the support of his old friend, President Song's entertainment company, not only was she given a spot on the show, but it was also agreed that Xu Zhu’s name must be included among the main cast of girls in the script, ensuring her debut.
 

 
Once she gained some popularity, she would then tackle reliable but lower-difficulty roles in reputable productions, gradually building her career. This was considered one of the most stable and replicable paths to stardom after the rise of instinctive films.
 

 
If she couldn’t act, she could always appear on variety shows.
 

 
Without dramatic life experiences, being cute and charming on variety shows would still win the audience’s favor.
 

 
President Song, aware of the situation at home, advised, “Tong Zhao will definitely mind about the resources you were supposed to give her being given to your sister. Once she finds out, she’ll likely hold a grudge against you even more.”
 

 
“I want her to know that everything she gets is given by me and that I can take it all back anytime. I can give it to anyone I want. Xu Zhu has been raised too pampered by her mother; honestly, I’m not too fond of her either, but she can be used to balance Tong Zhao and make her realize she’s no longer the privileged only child.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming lit a cigarette and spoke slowly.
 

 
His eyes, clouded by indulgence, were filled with a determined confidence rooted in money and power. Those who obeyed would be rewarded, while those who defied him would lose everything—this was the rule of the Tong family.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s multiple life experiences, she understood that the world operated by many rules.
 

 
Big rules overshadow the small ones.
 

 
The pampered little tyrant from a wealthy family found that no one catered to him at school, and school rules didn’t apply in society. Just like when Tong Zhao, transformed into a favored concubine's daughter with a background of extinguishing wives, shone brightly during the selection, captivating the emperor at first sight. She leaped from the domestic struggle to the palace intrigue arena, advancing in status with her acting skills and strategy. Dealing with those scoundrel fathers, stepmothers, and half-sisters later was a piece of cake.
 

 
Tong Zhao's goal was to step out of the Tong family's circle and explore a bigger stage.
 

 
With a week left before the start of filming for *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor*, Tong Zhao focused on three things at home.
 

 
1. Nurturing Her Beauty
 

 
In ancient times and in the world of cultivation, Tong Zhao collected some natural beauty remedies that proved quite effective. As the saying goes, "Eighteen is free from ugly women." She was already beautiful, but after her mother’s death, she had been crying and suffering from insomnia daily, which had damaged her skin and complexion. A few days of proper care quickly restored her radiant appearance.
 

 
The role of the favored concubine in *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor* was that of a stunning beauty. Regardless of her acting skills, her looks needed to be convincing.
 

 
2. Taking Online Courses
 

 
In her original world, with the maturity and near-universal adoption of holographic technology, physical universities had gradually declined in popularity. People preferred the convenience of this technology. Unfortunately, holographic pods were very expensive, and Tong Zhao, who was penniless after leaving her home, could not afford one. She had to rely on a regular computer for learning, with self-discipline being her only aid.
 

 
3. Channeling the Spirit of the Favored Concubine
 

 
Strictly speaking, this referred to her former self.
 

 
After many practice sessions, Tong Zhao had become proficient at switching between personas in reality. However, since she couldn't afford a holographic pod, her practice was still theoretical.
 

 
"When will I ever leave this crappy place…”
 

 
A woman lying on a single bed was doing leg lifts, aiming to make her thigh lines more pronounced and tight. Despite her plain face, the charm and delicacy in her eyes made her seem like she was reclining on a luxurious concubine’s chair. If anything about her attire or lifestyle wasn’t the best, she would sulk and act spoiled.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao herself had always been indifferent to her living conditions.
 

 
It wasn’t a matter of life or death, and she didn’t particularly enjoy seeking favors from men.
 

 
Her nature wasn’t suited for being a pampered and scheming concubine; it was left to the “Empress Consort” from her past experiences in palace intrigues to take on that role.
 

 
A week passed in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The holographic pods used for film shooting were more advanced and required going outside the home to the studio’s specialized pods.
 

 
Tong Zhao did her makeup, wore a simple black outfit, tied her hair into a high ponytail, and added a black bunny-ear headband as an accessory. She looked both cool and cute, making her aura hard to pin down.
 

 
After taking a cab to the film studio, she first registered her personal information at the front desk. As she walked through the building, she saw many attractive faces, mostly people hoping to find audition opportunities, perhaps stumbling upon a role that blended well with their "true self."
 

 
The corridor benches were filled with competitors, and the atmosphere was inevitably tense.
 

 
There was youthful vitality and ambition, but also disappointment and confusion. As Tong Zhao passed through the corridor with her light pink oversized sunglasses, she seemed to stand out in stark contrast.
 

 
Behind the vibrant-colored sunglasses, only her high-bridged nose, slightly upturned and full lips, and the elegant, tight line of her jaw could be seen. Her steps were light and lively, and even without seeing her expression, one could sense her composed and cheerful demeanor.
 

 
Such composure must mean she will perform well in the audition.
 

 
Those who saw her couldn't help but think with envy.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had experienced many grand scenes.
 

 
The last time her expression changed dramatically was when she saw nearly ten thousand zombies surrounding the city from atop a high wall.
 

 
Arriving on the thirty-first floor in the elevator, Tong Zhao was immediately taken by the stage manager to meet the director.
 

 
When the director saw Tong Zhao, both the assistant director and the actors with him had slightly grim expressions.
 

 
There was a reason for this. The last time Tong Zhao came for an audition, she had appeared disheveled and lost. Her “true self” at the audition was also dull and confused—beautiful, indeed, but lacking the aura of a great beauty. It was hard to believe she was truly an affluent young lady. Such a person should have been cut from the audition, but since the director insisted on using this connection, no one else could speak up.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was just a character to drive the plot, so a decent face was enough.
 

 
Young actors who only had looks were something the audience had grown accustomed to.
 

 
“Jian Shu.”
 

 
Before calling out to him, Tong Zhao removed her sunglasses and hung them around her neck, revealing a pair of bright eyes.
 

 
The director acknowledged her and signaled her to follow him to the side.
 

 
After assessing her face and noting her good complexion, he encouraged her, “It seems like you took my advice to heart. Having your own career is most important. Perform well later; don’t put too much pressure on yourself. The empress consort is just a decorative role—it’s quite easy to play well.”
 

 
The director had given similar pep talks to many others.
 

 
Nervousness was inevitable.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled upon hearing this.
 

 
Director Xu Zijiang had wanted to help her in his previous life, but she failed to seize the opportunity and ended up becoming a pitiful figure, much to her enemies' satisfaction. This time, she would not follow the same path. She nodded obediently, “Got it, Jian Shu. I will do my best.”
 

 
“Go ahead.”
 

 
Seeing her obedient, the director felt reassured but also guessed that her performance might not be outstanding.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was a character that had nothing to do with being obedient. In the script, she was a scheming, cunning beauty. However, since the actress was spirited and had a good face, her performance would surely be better than last time, making her suitable for the role of a supporting character.
 

 
“Ah,” the screenwriter sighed, “I’m just afraid that your ‘true self’ won’t attract Emperor Ming.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shrugged nonchalantly, “By the way, does the empress consort meet her end by being given death by Emperor Ming? Maybe you should worry about whether he’ll love me so much that he won’t want to kill me.”
 

 
“...Huh?”
 

 
Under the skeptical and somewhat contemptuous gazes of others, Tong Zhao, along with the other actors, lay down in the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
Just before the equipment was activated, Tong Zhao activated her golden finger.
 

 
In the blink of an eye,
 

 
She transformed back into the palace legend who, in just three short years, rose from a courtesan to the position of empress consort!
# Chapter3
The director and staff monitored the shooting situation from the control room.
 

 
Holographic filming, similar to the quick-transmission themes in web novels, requires main actors to stay at the film studio throughout the shoot to maintain continuity. Unlike traditional films, which can be shot out of sequence, holographic filming must follow the chronological order of the script, with very few retakes. This is to minimize the changes in the performance of the "original self" based on real-life experiences, as closed shooting is designed to reduce these fluctuations.
 

 
Before closed shooting became popular, there was an actor who performed the role of a playboy well in the first half of the month. By mid-month, after being cheated on by his girlfriend, he was deeply affected and turned to Buddhism, refusing to flirt with women during the shoot. This forced a recast and reshoot. The original actor became a monk and occasionally took on roles requiring handsome monks.
 

 
He was known as the "Buddhist Idol," a rare example of a successful career transformation in the entertainment industry.
 

 
"Director, can she handle this? Last time, even Wen Zhuo couldn't bring her into character," the assistant director said with a worried expression.
 

 
Wen Zhuo, who played the male lead as Emperor Ming, was somewhat known for his acting skills. He was strong and well-suited for roles such as emperor and domineering CEO. Having debuted as a lead in idol dramas, he valued the opportunity to star in serious dramas. Although he had some reservations about the relationship with Tong Zhao, he still cooperated with the audition.
 

 
After the audition, his mood had somewhat deteriorated.
 

 
On the original timeline, due to Tong Zhao's poor performance during her first audition, the "original self" had a negative opinion of her, leading to a superficial portrayal of the Emperor's favor towards the concubine. It came across as a plastic relationship, resulting in a subpar effect.
 

 
After Wen Zhuo left the studio and watched the footage, he was deeply disheartened.
 

 
...
 

 
In the scene, the frail Empress was trying to promote her cousin to Emperor Ming during dinner.
 

 
In the story, this cousin was not close to the Empress.
 

 
She was selected from the Chen family by a family decision and promised to outshine the harem with her beauty.
 

 
"Legend of Emperor Ming" has a light-hearted tone, focusing on events not covered in official history, with interactions between the Emperor and two ministers, and the daily life in the harem as a subplot. The concubine, who is introduced later, represents a dark chapter during Emperor Ming's reign—a notorious beauty disaster that became a topic of interest for future generations.
 

 
The Emperor and Empress had a distant and discordant relationship. Emperor Ming disliked the Empress’s power-grabbing ways and showed a frosty demeanor when she tried to promote the new Chen family girl. Only after the girl showcased her gentle charm did the Emperor’s demeanor slowly soften.
 

 
This was the script.
 

 
But on the monitoring screen, after hearing this, Emperor Ming, played by Wen Zhuo, darkened his expression and immediately stood up to leave!
 

 
“What’s going on?” the assistant director asked in surprise.
 

 
“It seems that Wen Zhuo dislikes Tong Zhao too much, which is affecting his 'original self' behavior,” another person whispered.
 

 
So, instinctive films are not easily salvaged by repeated takes.
 

 
An actor's emotions can affect the behavior of their "original self."
 

 
“Should we pause? If the Emperor Ming refuses to even meet the concubine, the entire shoot will be impossible,” the assistant director inquired.
 

 
“Let’s wait a bit…”
 

 
Just as the director was sinking into deep concern, a delicate hand pulled aside the curtain, and Tong Zhao stepped forward to perform a grand bow. She had her hair in an elegant bun, and as she bowed her head, it was lower than usual, deliberately exposing a section of her snowy-white neck. Under the dim candlelight, it created a delicate, silky visual effect.
 

 
Men are visual creatures.
 

 
While the chest, waist, and legs are often associated with sexiness, Tong Zhao believed that the real erogenous zone is the mind. Sexiness is based on imagination; it can be a glimpse of the back of the neck, an exposed ankle, or a delicate silver bell on a slender wrist.
 

 
By exposing vulnerable areas and attracting the gaze of the predator, it evokes affection.
 

 
This is the experience summed up by the long-reigning favorite concubine in the harem.
 

 
Returning to conquer the Emperor with the experience of a top-ranked favored concubine is like using a dragon-slaying sword to deal with the deer in a beginner’s village.
 

 
As everyone inside and outside the scene was nervously waiting, Emperor Ming stopped in his tracks and looked at the young woman kneeling before him.
 

 
“Raise your head,” he commanded.
 

 
The staff outside the scene breathed a sigh of relief, and the director zoomed in to give Tong Zhao a close-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, showing no sign of timidity before the emperor.
 

 
Her snow-white skin and pink dress made her face look like a peach blossom.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes were full of laughter, with a clean and sweet aura. Her bright, full lips were slightly curved, irresistibly alluring.
 

 
Every inch of her was beautiful, with no flaws to be found.
 

 
One couldn't help but wonder, hidden beneath the fabric, was every part was equally flawless?
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
The staff faced with this stunning beauty felt their hearts skip a beat. The young man in charge of monitoring equipment murmured, “Tong Zhao’s original self is more charming than the real person.” The assistant director nodded in surprise, “She was so lost in the first audition in front of the Emperor Ming, and now she performs so well in the second try. No wonder she’s the daughter of the legendary Tong actress.”
 

 
“Of course, I’ve always said Zhao Zhao has talent.” The director loved hearing praise for his star and became even more convinced that he hadn’t made a mistake in choosing her.
 

 
Let’s return to the scene.
 

 
Emperor Ming was so impressed that he helped Tong Zhao to her feet and allowed her to dine with him.
 

 
During the meal, Tong Zhao showed no signs of nervousness. She cast flirtatious glances at Emperor Ming, behaving like a perfect fox spirit. Emperor Ming, in turn, wore a gentle and amused expression, clearly captivated by this bold and beautiful young woman. “Just now, I was very fortunate…” He paused, feeling that this statement might be inappropriate.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not rush him and continued to gaze at him.
 

 
“I almost missed out on such a wonderful young lady.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the monitoring room, the staff had complex expressions.
 

 
The lead actor, Song Wanzhuo, was known for his upright character and had no rumors of scandal. Previously, as a leading man in idol dramas, he had always been portrayed as a seasoned professional, endearing himself to female fans. But now…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor completely entranced by beauty?
 

 
Although he performed his role excellently and the character of Emperor Ming was supposed to be like this, it seemed he had taken it too far!
 

 
“This,” the assistant director revealed the truth, “Wanzhuo has been drawn into the scene by Tong Zhao.”
 

 
……
 

 
The next part of the story shows that even though Emperor Ming knew everything was arranged by the Empress and the Chen family, he couldn’t resist favoring the Chen girl and officially designated her as Chen Mei. Since the scene needed to pass approval, no bed scenes were filmed. Instead, actors would have a brief memory of intimacy inserted by the equipment before switching scenes.
 

 
To enhance the likelihood of the Emperor Ming actor being captivated by the beauty, the scriptwriters cleverly set this vague memory to be extremely pleasurable.
 

 
After being designated as a beauty, Tong Zhao only had four scenes left.
 

 
These four scenes could be summarized in eight words:
 

 
Troublemaking and insatiable.
 

 
The assistant director smiled and said, “Brother Jian, you can finally rest easy.”
 

 
“There's no such thing as resting easy when shooting a primal film. I’m quite worried that Tong Zhao won’t perform well. Although the problematic content has long been written into the character’s mind, based on what I know of Tong Zhao, she’s a sweet and easy-going girl, not at all troublesome, very considerate, and caring about others' feelings…”
 

 
Just as the director finished speaking, the monitoring screen showed Tong Zhao, who had been excused from the next day’s audience with the Empress, comfortably refusing to see the Empress and instead lounging on the dragon bed. A nervous palace maid who had been assigned with her was anxiously discussing the implications, but Tong Zhao was nonchalantly relaxed, saying, “The Empress wants to use me to bear a child, but I won’t fulfill her wish. Once you enter the palace, you belong to the Emperor; let the Chen family face their own flood.”
 

 
The senior palace maid was even more worried after hearing this. However, after the secret guard reported back to the Emperor, Emperor Ming was very pleased.
 

 
Director: “What was the original range of the lines here?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “It was a complaint about how the Chen family treated her poorly and used her; it was meant to be quite tragic. I intended for the audience to sympathize with her, as even despicable people have their pitiable aspects.”
 

 
But Tong Zhao’s performance was not tragic at all.
 

 
She was extremely happy, living much better than she had in the Chen family.
 

 
When actors enter a holographic shoot, they are infused with character settings, memories, and certain behavioral directives. Since the role of the consort is a minor female character with limited detail, the setting is relatively thin, giving the actor a lot of leeway—she is a beauty who brings disaster but without a specific style, so she can be either a delicate green tea or a seductive red tea, as long as it aligns the main storyline in a general sense.
 

 
People noticed that Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the favored consort was, well, how to put it?
 

 
Too cute and naive.
 

 
Her interactions with Emperor Ming, full of coquettishness and cuteness, turned a historical drama into an idol drama with a pink bubble. Even the middle-aged assistant director was starting to believe in love again. It seemed she wasn’t constrained by her background setting at all, showing no fear of the Emperor. Every word and action hit the Emperor’s cute spots perfectly.
 

 
When interacting with the Emperor, Tong Zhao’s portrayal of Consort Chen includes a small gesture.
 

 
She likes to take the Emperor's large hand in hers, nestling her small face into it with a sense of devotion, like a little dog entirely devoted to him. Her bright eyes also look up at him with a moist gaze, making the usually domineering Emperor Ming soften completely.
 

 
This small gesture is memorable and leaves an impression on the audience.
 

 
“It’s troubling; Tong Zhao’s portrayal doesn’t seem bad at all,” said the lighting technician.
 

 
She is very favored, but she lacks the edge of a wicked woman.
 

 
“However, their interactions are quite cute. After the show airs, there might be a new ship.”
 

 
“Ha ha, forget it. How many female viewers don't have their own opinions on our show…”
 

 
The filming went smoothly, and the backstage atmosphere was good. At this moment, one person’s expression changed: “Zhang Meng, who plays the Empress, is planning to deal a deadly blow to Consort Chen. A colorless and tasteless poison has been mixed into today's meal and has already been served to Tong Zhao!”
 

 
How could this happen?
 

 
In the storyline, the Empress’s dissatisfaction with her cousin develops gradually.
 

 
Zhang Meng is also a rather steady actor.
 

 
Screenwriter: “It might be because Tong Zhao’s performance was too arrogant. She didn't even go to pay her respects and acted as if, having slept with the Emperor, she had no intention of doing anything for her family, which might have provoked the already anxious and ill Empress.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “And now she wants to take drastic measures?”
 

 
The screenwriter insisted, “Characters need to be exaggerated to have tension. If they’re ordinary and we don’t exaggerate the setting, the plot becomes bland!”
 

 
…
 

 
At this point, it was indeed quite exaggerated—Consort Chen hadn’t even become a favored consort yet and was about to be done away with.
 

 
The director made a quick decision: “Give the palace maid next to Tong Zhao a direct command to overturn that bowl of soup.”
 

 
A direct command involves controlling a character to perform a specific action. Afterward, the character will be puzzled by their own behavior, making it a tool for urgent situations and not suitable for repeated use as it can be obvious to the audience.
 

 
“There’s no time left!”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao had already picked up the delicate porcelain soup bowl.
 

 
She sniffed the soup with her dainty nose.
 

 
Although she could only smell the rich aroma of chicken soup, her brows furrowed, and her soft lips curled into a mocking smile:
 

 
“Is this it?”
# Chapter4
The "quick transmigration" had given Tong Zhao many abilities beyond the ordinary.
 

 
The cultivation techniques from the immortal world were useless in a plane without spiritual energy, but they were still effective for strengthening the body and enhancing appearance. In the martial arts world, Tong Zhao had come from an assassin family and had been immersed in countless toxins from a young age. She had an inexplicable sensitivity to poisons that could be fatal to the human body. Regardless of how diluted the poison was or how it was mixed into rich food, she could detect it just by smell.
 

 
Her personality had changed, but the knowledge she had acquired remained the same.
 

 
“I don’t want to drink this anymore; take it away,”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao lay down on the couch, her flawless face showing a hint of arrogance. She instructed, “Don’t drink it secretly. If I don’t want something, no one else should touch it, even if it means throwing it away.”
 

 
Accustomed to her capricious behavior, the palace maid dared not disobey and could only regretfully pour the entire bowl of fine chicken soup away.
 

 
…
 

 
The screenwriter was surprised: “Is Tong Zhao just lucky?”
 

 
The director gave him a stern look.
 

 
However, the next development genuinely astonished the staff.
 

 
When the empress failed to gain favor, the younger cousin only became more cherished, gaining unprecedented popularity in the palace. Emperor Ming showed no signs of diminishing his interest in her. Initially intending to watch from the sidelines and let other high-ranking concubines deal with her, they each took turns trying to teach her a lesson. This was part of the script: to have her suffer and then transform from a scheming vixen into a black-hearted fox. However…
 

 
The character played by Tong Zhao, the Chen beauty, had never suffered once.
 

 
When it came to mentioning the Chen beauty's overbearing behavior, the lower-ranked concubines pointed out that she didn’t have the demeanor expected of her rank.
 

 
The emperor, still infatuated with Chen's beauty, decided to ask Tong Zhao for an explanation. Tong Zhao, pouting with a look that made the emperor not tired of her, said angrily, “No one at home treated me well. After entering the palace, only the emperor dotes on me. I’m not trying to show off. I just feel… I’m the one the emperor cherishes. The most distinguished man in the world treats me well; what could I possibly do wrong?”
 

 
She then muttered to herself, “I haven’t done anything wrong.”
 

 
When a man is enamored, everything a woman does seems right.
 

 
Tong Zhao aimed to establish a lasting impression during this period, gradually changing her character, providing continuous novelty, and achieving a sense of accomplishment. She started as a pampered child and then became a charming, confident favorite after her promotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao nestled in Emperor Ming’s embrace, letting him hold her slender waist.
 

 
"Your Majesty, they say my behavior doesn’t match my rank, but I don’t want to change. They think I’m unworthy, but I don’t care. Do you think I am worthy, Your Majesty?"
 

 
She lifted her face to look at Emperor Ming, and the director quickly zoomed in for a close-up.
 

 
The so-called "ironclad" straight man, Song Wanzhuo, saw the beauty's eyes turning red and felt sympathy. He wiped her tears and said something that left the staff stunned: "Why are you crying? I haven’t blamed you. Of course, you’re worthy. There’s no need to change."
 

 
?
 

 
Wanzhuo, you’re this good at handling emotions?
 

 
In the previous idol drama, you hurt the heroine’s feelings with your blunt handling of conflicts, but now you’re spouting sweet words in this palace drama?
 

 
This is actually not Song Wanzhuo’s fault.
 

 
In the previous idol drama, the heroine’s "true self" was a bright and lively little sun. Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" followed the script and fell for her. However, just like a forced situation is never sweet, apart from the plot, he wouldn’t have many sweet details for the heroine.
 

 
Who is the Consort Chen?
 

 
No matter how many emperors there are, she could win their favor just the same.
 

 
In the next day's plot, without Tong Zhao’s scenes, everyone thought her role was over. It was already quite an improvement that Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" could say sweet words to comfort others.
 

 
However, after the morning court session, Emperor Ming ordered that Consort Chen be promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen.
 

 
From Consort to Imperial Concubine—this was not just a promotion but a significant leap.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was known for his decisive action.
 

 
Does the favored consort not want to change her ways?
 

 
Fine, then it must be an issue with her rank. Change the rank, and it’s resolved.
 

 
As for why she became an Imperial Concubine?
 

 
Because the person behind the scenes making sour comments is a respected lady, which is just enough to push her down a rank.
 

 
After a round of analysis by the behind-the-scenes staff, everyone was deeply impressed.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Well, in the script, she was supposed to be promoted to Imperial Concubine in seven episodes."
 

 
Director: "That’s how instinctive movies work!"
 

 
Who could watch this and not say Tong Zhao’s true self is impressive?
 

 
The screenwriter, feeling helpless, just hoped that the following developments wouldn’t be too unexpected. Former writers often said sentimentally that characters in their writing developed their own ideas and that the writer merely put them on paper and couldn’t control them. Little did they know that years later, instinctive movies would make such worries a reality.
 

 
After being promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen, Tong Zhao became even more audacious.
 

 
When she was in a good mood, she would skip the morning greetings and lazily lie on the couch, enjoying a lie-in.
 

 
When she was in a bad mood, she would dress elaborately to go for the morning greetings. The imperial harem had strict dress codes with prohibited colors, but as everything she wore was a gift from the Emperor, accusing her of breaking the rules was tantamount to blaming the Emperor. Thus, the other concubines could only swallow their grievances, resenting her for her petty displays, only knowing how to pile on gold and jewels without any refined elegance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t care about them.
 

 
She wore the largest and finest jade and dared to wear a massive string of rubies. Such fine items would make anyone of lesser beauty look pale in comparison, but under the director’s close-up shots, the dazzlingly dressed Tong Zhao overshadowed the entire harem, truly making the six palaces' makeup appear colorless.
 

 
Although her behavior was inappropriate, she carried a kind of languid indifference in her gestures, as if no one in the world was worth her attention. She was like the faint scent of incense after it had burned out—fleeting, elusive, and ungraspable in its charm.
 

 
As the main plot of *Emperor Ming* developed to the tribute from a vassal state, Emperor Ming rewarded two important ministers. In the Qiang Kingdom, there was a tradition of comparing virtuous talents to pearls, and the largest East Sea pearl became a crucial plot item contested by the male second and third leads.
 

 
However...
 

 
Scene: The Imperial Study
 

 
Characters: Emperor Ming and Chief Steward Hai, who was about to report the list of tributes.
 

 
This was the original script.
 

 
But under the surveillance of the behind-the-scenes staff, Tong Zhao, dressed very plainly, barged in.
 

 
?
 

 
What are you doing here? Quite the scene-stealer.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t like the idea of adding extra charm, but he had specifically allowed Concubine Chen to come in.
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, understanding the situation, lowered his head. He guessed Concubine Chen had come to seek favor and make her presence known, which didn’t concern him.
 

 
The Emperor asked her what she wanted.
 

 
Tong Zhao, not bothering with formalities, didn’t grind ink but rather casually sat on the Emperor’s lap. Clearly acting out of bounds, she tilted her head and rested it on his broad shoulder, making one doubt whether she could walk independently at all. She spoke in a delicate and pretentious manner: “I haven’t been to the morning greetings these past few days.”
 

 
“I heard about it.”
 

 
“Who told you, Your Majesty?”
 

 
The Emperor replied coolly, “I figured it out myself.”
 

 
“It’s actually not my fault,” Tong Zhao, undeterred by his seemingly indifferent attitude, said sullenly. “I ran out of clothes to wear and don’t have new accessories to visit the other ladies.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, who had been pretending to be invisible, was shocked.
 

 
How shameless can Concubine Chen be!
 

 
Since her favor began, a steady stream of rewards flowed into her Yanxi Palace.
 

 
Moreover, saying she wouldn’t go for morning greetings without new accessories—could such a thing be said by a consort? Isn’t she embarrassed?
 

 
Emperor Ming: “This is unreasonable.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Yes, yes, Your Majesty is wise!”
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, her red lips slightly curled, and her eyes moist: “I want to wear new clothes every time I appear before Your Majesty, to give you a pleasant surprise.”
 

 
Emperors come in many types.
 

 
Some prefer spirited young women who aren’t afraid of authority and speak their minds, while Emperor Ming’s preference was very clear: he was a top-notch male chauvinist, not particularly concerned with women's issues as long as they pleased him and acted coquettishly. He was very receptive to that.
 

 
Many women may disdain this, but it’s effective.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t comment on this flimsy excuse but simply looked at Chief Steward Hai and said, “Since she’s here, let’s see what tributes have come this year and choose some favorites.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Just like that? Your Majesty, please reconsider!”
 

 
As a result, the East Sea Pearl, which was a key plot item fought over by the two ministers, was picked by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Of course, she also took many excellent clothes, furs, and accessories, but this pearl was the best. It was listed first on the tribute list by the vassal state’s envoy, indicating it was truly a valuable item.
 

 
Screenwriter: "What?!"
 

 
Screenwriter: "I worked two all-nighters on this script, and now it’s just gone??? Song Wanzhuo, wake up!!"
 

 
Life truly is full of ups and downs.
 

 
He was so angry that he didn’t even call Song Wanzhuo by name anymore.
 

 
In instinctive films, there’s no going back. Although the plot changed, the director didn’t call for a reshoot. Considering the cost of each shoot, the screenwriter could only humbly pat his rapidly thinning hair and mutter, “When Song Wanzhuo comes out, I’m definitely going to grab him by the shoulders and shake him, make him wake up and stop favoring this little enchantress, Chen!”
 

 
The Assistant Director pointed out: “Just yesterday, you wanted Song Wanzhuo to be nicer to Tong Zhao in the film to make the favored consort role more convincing.”
 

 
The screenwriter was even more frustrated.
 

 
He truly didn’t expect Tong Zhao to become so captivating once she got into character.
 

 
……
 

 
After shooting five consecutive episodes, it was already late at night when the actors emerged from the chamber.
 

 
Exhausted, the actors followed medical advice to exercise in the specially provided gym to counteract the negative effects of long hours lying in the chamber. After sweating it out, they showered and went to bed. This was the routine for most actors, as shooting instinctive films was incredibly demanding.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was an exception.
 

 
After finishing his stretching exercises and his usual rigorous workout, he returned to his dorm room and requested a sample of the footage from the director.
 

 
When he left the chamber, the screenwriter had been casting a very subtle gaze at him.
 

 
That gaze was tinged with five parts disappointment, three parts reproach, and two parts sympathy, which made him uneasy, suggesting that there might have been a flaw in the TV show’s performance. The lead actor he was working with was usually reliable; the only potential issue was likely with Tong Zhao, the relationship client.
 

 
Sitting on his bed, Song Wanzhuo answered a concerned call from his manager: "Hmm, I’m still up. I’m watching the sample footage before going to bed."
 

 
The manager advised, "Be careful not to be too tired tomorrow. It’ll be the same whether you watch it or not; you’ll remember it by tomorrow anyway."
 

 
Appearing in instinctive films is like having a long dream. To avoid an overload of memories flooding into his brain upon waking, the long-term memories would gradually be sorted out.
 

 
The amount of memory from five episodes would be restored after a full night’s sleep.
 

 
"It’s fine, one episode is half an hour, so five episodes will be two and a half hours. I’ll watch it at double speed and finish by midnight, then go to bed. I’m worried about Tong Zhao’s performance and afraid I might not hide my opinions about her in the show. The screenwriter's gaze towards me was strange; I’m afraid I’ve lost my touch…"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo calculated it well.
 

 
However, after watching, as he gradually recalled the memories from the show, he was completely unable to sleep.
 

 
No wonder the screenwriter’s gaze was odd…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor? I don’t know him!
 

 
Author's Note:

# Chapter5
The male lead couldn’t sleep, but Tong Zhao slept very well.
 

 
The persona of Consort Chen was not yet satisfied and wanted to continue flirting with men. She had to suppress it forcefully—she feared that if she accidentally let Consort Chen out to play for a few days, she might come back to find a long list of backup admirers on her phone, and even jumping into the Yellow River wouldn’t cleanse her reputation.
 

 
Consort Chen giggled: “What’s to be afraid of? A woman’s success is inseparable from men.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied: “That was your era. The modern world is different.”
 

 
Consort Chen huffed and ignored her.
 

 
In quick transmigration, conquering a world is almost like a lifetime. Personality splitting is a forced and helpless measure to protect oneself.
 

 
These personas are like one-sided and extreme versions of Tong Zhao.
 

 
One who can’t live without men and likes muscular men.
 

 
And another who is annoyed by males in general and can only slightly tolerate young and inexperienced ones.
 

 
Early in the morning, Tong Zhao enjoyed the special gym facilities, did basic muscle exercises, and then returned to her room to meditate and absorb the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy of this era is thin compared to the cultivation era, persistent practice will surely bring great benefits over time. Since it is an intangible wealth accumulated through her own blood and tears, she would make full use of it.
 

 
In the staff canteen, the director immediately spotted Tong Zhao.
 

 
He took his meal and naturally sat down in front of her. After exchanging a few pleasantries and noting that she looked well, he said, “The part you acted in will start airing tomorrow. My suggestion is not to look at the reviews. Both good and bad feedback can easily affect your subsequent performance… Also, try to avoid things that might destabilize your emotions. For instance, during his performance, Song Wanxue would cut off external communication and only let his manager relay important matters.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, looking particularly obedient.
 

 
In truth, she didn’t take it to heart.
 

 
Tong Zhao had long since grown indifferent to others' evaluations.
 

 
As for Consort Chen? She was most accustomed to being criticized and insulted. Whether it was the military officials cursing her during court sessions or the unsuccessful scholars writing sarcastic poetry, it didn’t affect her beauty. The scholars had long deciphered the secret code to gain favor with the emperor—flattering the consort with praise.
 

 
“Got it, thank you, Uncle Jian.”
 

 
“No need to be so polite…”
 

 
Before he could finish, Tong Zhao’s phone rang, with the caller ID flashing brightly: [Tong Zhenming].
 

 
Under the director’s disapproving gaze, Tong Zhao answered the call.
 

 
“Hello, Mr. Tong?”
 

 
The distant address successfully irritated Tong Zhenming, causing him to miss the cheerfulness in his daughter's tone.
 

 
“After all these years of raising you, you don’t even know how to address your father,” he sneered, unable to wait to remind her, “The first episode of *Star Selection Girls* reached platinum level in viewership.”
 

 
Viewership ratings are categorized into unique levels: black iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, emerald, and peak. Achieving the platinum level in the first episode indicates that the investment in pre-promotion has received reasonable market feedback. If the quality is maintained and effective marketing is applied, it might even surpass the diamond level.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Are you making a comeback in midlife?”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhenming was momentarily stumped by his daughter’s thought process: “Zhu Zhu was on that show; in the first episode, she had the most screen time, and the member discussion was also in the top three.”
 

 
He didn’t really understand the entertainment industry but wanted his daughter to know that his investment had paid off.
 

 
Tong Zhenming turned his attention to provoking his eldest daughter.
 

 
He knew that Tong Zhao was shooting an instinctive film and that it was best not to have severe emotional fluctuations during production. He also knew this could significantly unsettle her performance. But so what? Disobedient juniors should lose everything. He wanted his daughter to understand his authority and set some rules.
 

 
“Let me know when you’re in drag. I won’t watch any show you’re in.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was flat but laced with sarcasm.
 

 
The director’s look of disapproval turned to surprise as he watched.
 

 
After ending the call, Tong Zhao immediately blocked her father’s number and explained to the director, “I’ll let him out when I’m in a better mood.”
 

 
Director: “I thought you’d yell at him.”
 

 
“Why should I scold him? Forget it. We're family by blood, and scolding feels too constrained. I know him well; bringing up my mother won't make him feel guilty. It’ll be more distressing for him if he’s caught off guard and has nowhere to vent his anger.”
 

 
As she spoke, Tong Zhao realized that what the director mentioned as “things that might destabilize your emotions” probably referred to *Star Selection Girls*. Uncle Zhi Jian was always meticulous, contrary to his rough exterior, and he cared for her, his junior, especially well. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel touched and allowed the director to comfort her for a while, appearing genuinely appreciative.
 

 
After finishing her meal, Tong Zhao left first.
 

 
The director, slowly savoring his tea, hadn’t enjoyed his quiet tea for long when Song Wanqing joined him.
 

 
“Director, are you very familiar with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Song Wanqing, handsome with a strong jaw and bright eyes, had a very upright and attractive appearance.
 

 
He usually spoke in a particularly sunny and cheerful manner, making him a young star appealing to all ages.
 

 
The director, seeing him unusually hesitant and unsure, felt a bit curious: “An old friend’s daughter wanted to act, so I gave her a chance. It was uncomfortable during the audition, but the actual performance adjusted well, right?”
 

 
“Far more than that.”
 

 
Last night, watching the sample footage, Song Wanqing was so embarrassed he rolled around on the bed, tossing and turning.
 

 
He thought that was the worst of it.
 

 
Little did he know that the real torment was still to come.
 

 
After struggling through just five hours of sleep, he woke up to find himself haunted by memories from the drama, frozen in the pressures of the past dynasty. Each day, he was convinced to execute the rebel’s daughter, which occupied a third of the storyline. Despite the opposition, he not only promoted Chen to a noble consort but also followed her wishes, giving her the title of "Consort Chen," conferring unlimited honor upon her...
 

 
Damn, it's overwhelming!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao from a distance earlier, Song Wanqing almost couldn’t resist walking over to embrace his beloved precious.
 

 
He voiced his troubles.
 

 
“Every time I close my eyes, I see Tong Zhao’s face. She’s my consort, you know? Really. It might not seem like it from just watching the sample footage, but the Emperor is completely captivated by the consort. He even thinks about her during court sessions. So, it’s quite normal for me to think about her during my morning workout, right?”
 

 
It's common for actors in instinctive films to be influenced by their on-screen emotions, so large productions might have professional psychologists on standby. *The Legend of the Emperor* was assessed before filming, and since it didn’t include scenes with major real-world impacts (like crimes or arson), there were no psychologists prepared. Therefore, actors usually seek help from the director when they have concerns.
 

 
Since Song Wanqing was familiar with Director Xu, he confided all his feelings to him.
 

 
Song Wanqing was deeply troubled.
 

 
Yet, when he looked up, he saw Director Xu smiling happily.
 

 
Song Wanqing: “...Is it really okay to build happiness on my suffering?”
 

 
“Sorry,” Director Xu’s smile faded, but the underlying emotion remained cheerful, “Since you both have such great chemistry, the audience will definitely feel it. You’ll also be able to clear the stigma of emotionless performances in romantic dramas.”
 

 
Instinctive films in idol dramas are famously easy to shoot.
 

 
After all, with handsome men and beautiful women, it’s not hard to create some sparks once the character templates are implanted in their minds.
 

 
Moreover, in idol dramas, the characters are often flat, the plot straightforward, and everyone is either a rich second-generation heir or a star. As long as you have a good-looking face, even if the acting is a bit wooden, the audience is willing to accept it.
 

 
But despite the easy nature of the material, Song Wanqing just couldn’t perform well.
 

 
He was too picky about women on a subconscious level.
 

 
After adopting the character template, he could be in a romance within the drama, but his romantic scenes lacked emotion.
 

 
What could be portrayed as a passionate love, at first sight, ended up looking like an arranged marriage.
 

 
But opportunities in the entertainment industry are mysterious.
 

 
Song Wanqing encountered an excellent manager who established an “old guard” persona for him. With many female fans who were drawn to his type, it was easy to win them over. Later, he starred in a commercial drama without any romantic plot, and his performance was outstanding, solidifying his position.
 

 
But with this stigma, Song Wanqing shouldn’t expect to play many romantic roles.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Song Wanqing’s expression brightened a bit.
 

 
However, his pride remained intact: “How can previous mediocre actresses compare to my beloved consort?”
 

 
“You were just complaining about whether you could replace your beloved consort,” the director pointed out, but recalling Tong Zhao’s performance during the initial audition, he gave Song Wanqing an out: “Don’t dwell on that. Her screen time is limited in the future. If you’re genuinely interested, you should get her contact information soon.”
 

 
Though she’s a supporting character, the consort’s role isn’t significant.
 

 
She’ll soon be condemned to death by the Ming Emperor due to family troubles.
 

 
There are many cases of actors developing feelings from their roles in instinctive films. The director, seeing that Song Wanqing is relatively clean and upright in the industry, offered this advice.
 

 
“Let’s see. If you really end up falling for her, I’m afraid I might be reluctant to have her killed off in the show and would just disband the harem directly.”
 

 
Song Wanqing joked.
 

 
He was afraid of genuinely falling for her after a few more looks, which is why he hadn’t dared to approach her earlier.
 

 
The director laughed and changed the subject to discuss the relationship between the male lead and the second male character.
 

 
Meanwhile, after returning to her room, Tong Zhao went online to check the situation with “Star Selection Girls.”
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao lived under the shadow of her stepsister's fame and success for so long that her heart had been tempered to the point where, while she bit into a juicy, sweet apple, she could scroll through Weibo about Xu Zhu with complete composure. She mainly wanted to confirm if everything was developing just as it did before her time travel.
 

 
Xu Zhu now had her own official Weibo account.
 

 
@StarSelectionGirl-XuZhu
 

 
@XuZhuNationalFanClub
 

 
There was also a fan club in the name association, likely organized by the company to give new fans from the first episode a place to gather and gradually develop into true fans.
 

 
#StarSelectionGirlXuZhu#
 

 
#WhiteRichBeautyPrincessXuZhu#
 

 
#XuZhuDangerousXiaohan#
 

 
Tong Zhao clicked on the entries related to the "White Rich Beauty Princess" tag.
 

 
[ZhuZhu the little princess is so sweet and good, mama is a fan!]
 

 
[Wow, look at Xu Zhu's whole set of high-end luxury stuff in her dorm, I’m genuinely envious. Does Princess Xu Zhu still need a little sister?]
 

 
[Arranging Xu Zhu as an extravagant YXH, is the editor’s brain malfunctioning? The girl clearly grew up with the best things and doesn’t take them seriously, totally speechless.]
 

 
Well, just like in her previous life, Xu Zhu’s image was crafted by her agent as the pampered little princess.
 

 
The fact that she grew up with the best things was indeed true.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was little, she had so many good things that she couldn’t use them all, and her close friend Xu Zhu would often take them.
 

 
Her mother knew about this and specially bought a new set for Xu Zhu.
 

 
Both mother and daughter thought nothing of it since they were good friends.
 

 
Now, reflecting on it, Tong Zhao felt a bit nauseous and quickly sat down to recite a calming mantra, which made her feel much better. However, after reciting the mantra so often, it split off a part of her consciousness in the cultivation world. The usually silent personality of Lu Xianzhang rarely came out of hiding and said, “Those who betray me deserve to die.”
 

 
Every word seemed to emit a cold, sword-like aura.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and replied, “Alright, this is a law-abiding society.”
 

 
The Empress Chen Gui fei chuckled, “Let Xu Zhu this bitch be smug for a few days. Once Zhao Zhao’s life is better than hers, it’ll be her turn to suffer.”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, who couldn’t stand her flirtatious ways with men, went silent again.
 

 
Empress Chen Gui fei continued her assault, “I performed so well in the drama, making the Emperor fall head over heels for me, giving Zhao Zhao a big boost in the face. What use are you? If you’re useless, stay out of the way!”
 

 
When Tong Zhao first became Lu Xianzhang, she was being forced into marriage for her path to enlightenment.
 

 
The character’s deep-seated hatred of men meant that she lived a life of loneliness in that world.
 

 
After a moment of silence, Lu Xianzhang finally burst out with a powerful declaration:
 

 
“Give me a sword, and I’ll bloodily wash the Tong family clean!”
# Chapter6
Of course, Tong Zhao couldn’t really kill anyone.
 

 
She pacified Lu Xianzhang, then meditated and practiced for a while, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy in this world was extremely thin and immortality through cultivation was impossible, spending the same time on it was at least more effective than applying a hydrating face mask.
 

 
During this time, the episodes of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao began airing.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* maintained an average viewership rating at the tail end of the Diamond level, and online discussions were consistently high. For a newcomer, even a small guest role would be a coveted opportunity. The problem was that Song Wanxue’s reputation as a rigid, straight-laced man was well-known. Having him play an emperor enthralled by a favorite concubine? No problem; his majestic presence as the "Longevity Lord" was undeniable.
 

 
But having him portray an emperor who was lovesick and dazed by his favored concubine?
 

 
Fans could easily imagine him saying, “This is against the rules,” with his usual stern expression.
 

 
The romance between the Emperor and the Concubine was one of the few emotional storylines in the drama. Those who disliked Song Wanxue had been waiting for him to falter since the premiere, hoping for a glimmer of hope when the Concubine appeared.
 

 
Many were eagerly anticipating Song Wanxue's downfall.
 

 
Marketing accounts quickly joined in to stir the pot, and even Song Wanxue’s agent bought some promotional support to reinforce his image as an emotionless, straight-laced emperor—since he was bound to fail, it was better to extract some residual value from the collapse!
 

 
In the world of instinctive acting, who hasn’t had a failure?
 

 
As long as there’s a hook, there’s hype.
 

 
Indeed, with the buzz around #SongWanxueEmotionalScenes#, the latest episode featuring Tong Zhao performed well in the pre-release.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* aired at 6 PM, and the holographic viewing halls were already packed with people.
 

 
For those who couldn’t afford a holographic helmet or viewing pod, traditional viewing methods were also available. True drama fans subscribed to both options, first enjoying the director's camera work and narrative from a distance, then immersing themselves in a 360-degree experience of the drama. Regardless of the visual method, audiences could watch while sending bullet comments or even tune in to live commentary and critiques from streamers who had set up separate rooms for fans.
 

 
Of course, some of the gifts and tips received had to be shared with the drama and the platform.
 

 
While the audience and onlookers eagerly awaited Song Wanxue's performance, the attention given to Tong Zhao, the newcomer, was relatively low. After all, she lacked fame and had no agent or company backing her, operating purely independently. Her stepsister Xu Zhu would have been delighted to see her fail, so naturally, she wouldn’t help her out. Moreover, it was suspected that the high-spirited Tong Zhao wouldn’t ride on her stepsister's coattails.
 

 
Tong Zhao indeed wasn’t inclined to do so.
 

 
She considered it unlucky.
 

 
Song Wanxue's fans were also in high spirits.
 

 
In this lively atmosphere, the latest episode of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* began.
 

 
The story starts with the impatient Emperor Ming being summoned to the Empress's palace. The Emperor and the Empress, who was obtained through political marriage, had a strained relationship. Viewers humorously claimed that Song Wanxue's performance was true to character, portraying the distant and emotionally detached relationship between the Emperor and Empress so well that everyone believed there was no affection between them. The Emperor was even somewhat annoyed with her, resenting her excessive ambition and focus on securing benefits for her family.
 

 
Sure enough, when the Empress mentioned introducing her younger sister, Emperor Ming slammed his teacup down on the table with a dark face.
 

 
Audience members who had seen the plot summary knew that the Emperor was about to experience a dramatic change of heart.
 

 
[The more he despises her now, the more he will favor her later.]
 

 
[Waiting for Emperor Ming's moment of true affection.]
 

 
[While you're waiting for true affection, remember who’s playing the Emperor—it's Song Wanxue! Does he really have the awareness of "cherishing and valuing" in his mind? Only the director’s forceful intervention will likely make him succeed in this role.]
 

 
This refers to an emergency measure rarely used on main characters because it can create irreparable problems. Some characters might feel like they’re possessed, leading to endless complications. Since it’s not an action genuinely motivated by the character, the scene can appear very awkward.
 

 
As the audience debated, a delicate white hand parted the curtain, and a young woman stepped out gracefully.
 

 
At this moment, she maintained the proper etiquette for a woman presenting herself to the Emperor, with her head bowed.
 

 
Even the audience could not see her face.
 

 
But the camera clearly conveyed the message:
 

 
She was a stunning beauty.
 

 
Moreover, Tong Zhao’s figure was also exceptional, successfully piquing the audience's curiosity.
 

 
[Ahhh, I can’t see, camera, move down a bit!]
 

 
[Someone get the photographer and drag him out for execution!]
 

 
[I’m so frustrated, why can’t I afford a holographic chamber? I really want to bend down to see the beauty QAQ]
 

 
Fortunately, it didn’t take long. With Emperor Ming’s command, “Raise your head,” the audience finally got to see the appearance of the Empress's younger sister.
 

 
She was incredibly beautiful.
 

 
Even under the close-up ultra-clear camera, no flaws could be found. She looked up at Emperor Ming, and guided by the camera, the audience felt as if everyone was being boldly gazed upon and flirted with by her, just like Emperor Ming.
 

 
The audience subconsciously held their breath.
 

 
There are many beautiful people in the entertainment industry, but those who become famous are often those whose beauty can take your breath away. If the first impression doesn’t shock the audience, they’ll have to rely on their talent to slowly build a fanbase. But with just one glance, some industry insiders could tell that this girl was exceptional.
 

 
Gazing at her with her enchanting eyes, hearts softened.
 

 
[………]
 

 
[…………I need all the information on this lady within three seconds!]
 

 
[Everyone shut up, I’m going to give a number now. In three minutes, I want to follow the Empress’s sister’s Weibo!]
 

 
It’s no wonder the audience was moved. For instinctive films, portraying certain character auras cannot rely on traditional acting alone; it requires relevant life experiences and emotional depth. What they were seeing at that moment was the real-life embodiment of Empress Chen, who had once laughed her way through palace intrigues and enjoyed enduring favor.
 

 
Unable to do anything else, but top in charming others.
 

 
The audience was first struck by the new character’s beauty, then quickly immersed themselves back into the story.
 

 
Then they saw the Emperor, who spoke with an unexpectedly gentle tone.
 

 
?
 

 
For a moment, the screen was filled with question marks.
 

 
Humans are creatures of double standards.
 

 
It was normal for the audience to be impressed, but seeing the Emperor’s genuine affection, especially in the scene of Song Wanxue’s transformation, the show’s effect was maximized.
 

 
[When we’re sending question marks, it’s not that we have a problem, but that the Emperor has a problem.]
 

 
[Is this really the serious, old-fashioned Song Wanxue? He’s breaking his character…]
 

 
[Damn, but the brother’s gentle expression is so handsome!]
 

 
Fortunately, instinctive films can't be fake; they're akin to a semi-reality show. Even though the audience was amazed, they knew Song Wanxue’s previous performances weren’t fake. It just seemed that this time, he had somehow surpassed himself and performed even better in the film.
 

 
It might be that having more experience with instinctive films has made him better adapted to his "true self."
 

 
This was a common speculation.
 

 
Regardless, Song Wanxue’s improvement was a positive boost for the overall quality of "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor," and the audience felt more confident in immersing themselves in the story. However, as they continued watching, they started to notice something strange.
 

 
Was it not that Song Wanxue had suddenly become more perceptive, but rather that this newcomer was incredibly charming?
 

 
The audience saw Tong Zhao acting cute and innocent in front of the Ming Emperor, always displaying naive beauty, and managing to make the Ming Emperor look like a lovesick fool.
 

 
Such a sweet girl!
 

 
No wonder the Ming Emperor liked her; who wouldn’t want to be an emperor when faced with such beauty?
 

 
The episode ended with the audience’s admiration.
 

 
The biggest beneficiaries were undoubtedly the actors playing the Ming Emperor and his cousin.
 

 
Riding the wave of Song Wanxue’s major transformation, Tong Zhao gained considerable attention. After this episode aired, her previously ignored actor’s profile suddenly received several signing offers. However, most of these were from small agencies and minor companies trying their luck. She glanced at them, found none of them appealing, and decided to consider her options further without rushing into signing a contract.
 

 
After Tong Zhao opened her verified actor's Weibo account, the director noticed that she had no posts at all. He urged her to quickly post something so that when the official drama account promoted her, some fans might transfer their affection from the character to her.
 

 
This suggestion was also the director’s way of taking care of her.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t immediately think of what to post.
 

 
After all, she was originally quite low-key and didn’t really use social media. Her skills were all developed during her fast-travel experiences and were managed by other personas. Posting on Weibo was something she could leave to Han Zhi, who had become a top celebrity.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Zhi Ge, help me post a selfie on Weibo.]
 

 
[Sure.]
 

 
In no time, a clear and pleasant male voice echoed in her mind.
 

 
Perhaps because the system saw her mission completion rate as too high, ordinary roles were no longer challenging.
 

 
Han Zhi was the only time she had played a male character.
 

 
Han Zhi was exceptionally good at taking selfies. He had practiced it, knowing how to adjust angles and apply filters, and was more skilled than many girls. The results were outstanding. The person was still recognizable, but the appearance naturally looked even better.
 

 
After posting the selfie, Han Zhi went back to being low-profile.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
The one who turned the Emperor into a lovesick fool is me [image]
 

 
The caption adopted the concubine’s persona, but the accompanying selfie was quite different.
 

 
Han Zhi wore a black suspender dress with a matching beret. She was slender, but her lines were not particularly soft. The shot from above highlighted her graceful jawline and collarbone, and the composition was impeccable. With a casual glance angled slightly upward, it electrified the viewers who stumbled upon it.
 

 
Damn.
 

 
In the drama, her eyes were like autumn waters, but off-screen, they were dazzlingly electric?
 

 
Typically, such an outstanding performance in the first role is often due to a genuine portrayal.
 

 
Viewers were prepared to see a sweet little fairy (fairy or enchantress) but instead saw a cool, androgynous beauty. She was beautiful and still the same person, but the feeling was different.
 

 
Fans witnessed the transformation of a small actress from O to A, from 0 to 1, and their curiosity was immediately piqued.
 

 
Unlike Xu Zhu, who flaunted her privileged background and actively promoted herself to fans, Tong Zhao posted her Weibo and then ignored the online buzz. She hadn't signed with a company or had a manager, so the resulting heat and public opinion were entirely generated by the audience.
 

 
Director Xu Zijian was paying attention and increasingly convinced that the goddess's daughter was indeed a promising talent.
 

 
He needed to find her a reliable manager soon...
 

 
At this moment, some were happy, and some were worried.
 

 
Xu Zhu, in her all-weather filming dormitory, decided to ignore her sister’s affairs, fearing that competitors might notice any signs. Since she had already done all she could in terms of mindset, and her sister was very good at pretending in public, she didn’t believe she could keep up the pretense in a role in a reality film.
 

 
She was confident, so she wasn’t the one worried.
 

 
The one worried was the Emperor.
 

 
In the drama, the Emperor only favored Consort Shen, visiting her palace every day, and even wished he could hold her while reviewing official documents.
 

 
Outside the drama, he couldn't even see her, and he really missed her face.
 

 
He was obsessed.
 

 
He thought he was going to fall.
 

 
After all, he did like the type of woman that Consort Shen represented—delicate, graceful, and beautifully dependent on a man.
 

 
If he truly fell for her, he planned to pursue her once filming ended.
 

 
This thought persisted until he saw the actress playing Consort Shen lifting weights in the gym.
 

 
?
 

 
Why did the beloved have a barbell in her hand?
# Chapter7
Song Wanzhuo didn’t come at the best time.
 

 
At the moment, Tong Zhao's primary personality had lent control to Han Zhi, who said he wanted to lift some weights.
 

 
Tong Zhao also disliked the fact that her current body lacked any muscle tone and only appeared slim because she couldn't gain weight. So, she agreed to Han Zhi's small request, as long as he didn't overdo it. She didn't want to be a soft, puffy person, nor did she want to become a muscular, buff woman.
 

 
So, what Song Wanzhuo saw was a consort with an indifferent expression and eyes that, despite their starry brightness, had a cold undertone.
 

 
While exercising, Han Zhi tied her long hair into a neat ponytail.
 

 
In short, nothing about her looked like Consort Shen from *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming*.
 

 
He blurted out, "Tong Zhao, you’re training in the strength area too?"
 

 
Hearing someone call her name, Tong Zhao looked up at Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The face was still the same face.
 

 
Her eyelashes were long and thick, like dark raven feathers, but the eyes beneath were cold, almost electric.
 

 
"Yes, Brother Wanzhuo.”
 

 
In the entertainment industry, seniority is important, and Tong Zhao was also used to calling everyone "brother" or "sister" when she met them, always observing proper etiquette. As soon as she spoke, Song Wanzhuo sensed something different again. "Brother Wanzhuo" and "Your Majesty" were both forms of respect, but in the show, when the consort called out "Your Majesty," it was always with a soft, delicate southern accent, while the actress’s own voice was slightly deeper, with every pronunciation crisp and clear.
 

 
When Song Wanzhuo looked at her now, he didn’t feel the slightest flutter in his heart.
 

 
His sixth sense told him this wasn't his consort!
 

 
But it was indeed the same person.
 

 
Suppressing his strange thoughts, Song Wanzhuo moved to the equipment next to Tong Zhao and started training, chatting with her intermittently.
 

 
“The audience says we have great chemistry together.”
 

 
“Brother Wanzhuo guided me well, so my subconscious easily got into character.”
 

 
“Hehe,” Song Wanzhuo liked being praised, but he also spoke frankly: “Your 'id' is quite distinct and charismatic. Your future on the stage is bright. Trust me, after this airs, when you audition for palace drama roles, even if it’s not the lead, you’ll at least snag a supporting role.”
 

 
Compared to traditional films, there are far fewer instances of unspoken rules or backdoor deals in instinct films now.
 

 
First, instinct films, when done well, are genuinely profitable and have especially high production costs.
 

 
Second, those who need to use backdoor connections generally have weaker “id” traits.
 

 
The roles left for these connected individuals are usually wealthy young ladies or gentlemen and seductively charming green tea characters, allowing them to perform in line with their true selves.
 

 
Or they would be cast in minor roles that, even if performed mediocrely, wouldn’t affect the overall situation.
 

 
Originally, the role of the Empress's cousin was intended to be a mediocre vase character.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s surprising performance brought the character to life.
 

 
"Thanks, brother," Tong Zhao smiled slightly, but her tone remained cool and detached. "But next time, I’d like to try a different type of role. I might not audition for palace dramas for a while."
 

 
Hearing this, Song Wanzhuo’s face was full of disapproval.
 

 
After all, instinct films are different from traditional ones. There's no need to rush to broaden one's acting range. Especially for newcomers, it’s important to stabilize their “id” traits; at least that way, they can thrive within a particular genre. However, after a second thought, he gave her some solid advice: “You could try playing a femme fatale or a player type in a modern drama. That would suit you perfectly.”
 

 
Tong Zhao still smiled lightly. "Brother Wanzhuo really understands."
 

 
This wasn’t Han Zhi pretending; it was because Tong Zhao's different personas were almost arguing with each other in her mind.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I should always be the one on stage."
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I can make Zhao Zhao the most popular star among male fans! No man can resist me!"
 

 
Immortal Master Lu: "Only knowing how to seduce men has no future."
 

 
The personas accumulated from other worlds also wanted their chance to appear and leave a bold mark in instinct films. Naturally, they weren’t willing to see Tong Zhao always acting in palace dramas, which was the domain where Lady Chen, the Noble Consort, could slay the entire field.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "Anyway, Zhao Zhao's first role was played by me. I’ve contributed to Zhao Zhao's success! I’ve flirted with men for Zhao Zhao! I want to see Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"But the role you played wasn’t the female lead."
 

 
The war correspondent sharply hit the sore spot of Lady Chen, the Noble Consort.
 

 
The noble consort, after all, only played a guest role.
 

 
Tong Zhao massaged her buzzing head.
 

 
While she was dealing with the chaos in her mind, Song Wanzhuo finished his workout and left feeling refreshed.
 

 
Half of his happiness came from the endorphins of exercise, and the other half from resolving his inner conflict.
 

 
He called his agent and started rambling: "Old Zeng, I've interacted with Tong Zhao. I realized my little dilemma about falling for her because the role was so superficial. It’s nonexistent. She’s not my beloved consort—she’s my good bro!"
 

 
The agent was utterly bewildered.
 

 
"A good bro? Are you sure?"
 

 
He had watched the show, and the charm the Empress’s cousin displayed was exactly Song Wanzhuo's type.
 

 
"Really, you haven’t met her in person. The more I talk to her, the more I feel like she’s a guy," Song Wanzhuo mused, refining his description. "Not the kind of rough tomboy, but rather, she’s very refined and good-looking. But when we talk and interact, I subconsciously treat her like a bro—a cool, handsome dude."
 

 
Something like this?
 

 
The agent was puzzled. "It's good you didn't develop feelings for her because of the role. Your fans want you to focus on your career and not get a girlfriend too soon."
 

 
...
 

 
Since Tong Zhao's scenes were interspersed within the main storyline, when Song Wanzhuo re-entered the pod, she was on a video call with the agent recommended by the director. The agent was a competent woman aged between 28 and 32, surnamed Chu, whom Tong Zhao respectfully called Sister Chu.
 

 
Sister Chu was quite friendly and didn’t put on airs or lay down strict rules just because Tong Zhao was a newcomer. She was straightforward about the contract. Tong Zhao didn't have many demands; she was willing to fight for resources with her own abilities. She just wanted someone to help her arrange variety show appearances and promotions.
 

 
They discussed the contract details, and after reaching a consensus, they signed it.
 

 
One of the reasons things went so smoothly was that Tong Zhao remembered Sister Chu from her past life as quite capable, personally leading a top-tier male star to fame, without any particularly outrageous scandals. However, Sister Chu was the type who achieved success later in her career; in the original timeline, it would be a few more years before she met her benefactor.
 

 
After signing the contract, Sister Chu assured her that she would guide her well.
 

 
“I trust you,” Tong Zhao replied with a smile.
 

 
She wasn't interested in clinging to powerful connections ahead of time. Instead, she wanted to become someone others would want to cling to.
 

 
For five consecutive episodes, the parts featuring Tong Zhao were particularly popular—this girl was just too interesting.
 

 
At first, people thought she was a master manipulator, a "green tea" expert. Typically, when an ordinary person enters the palace, they would be cautious at first, endure the scolding of seniors, and only take revenge after establishing themselves. But not Chen Pin. Her way of gaining a foothold was to use the other concubines’ bullying against her to cry to the Emperor.
 

 
When ordinary concubines played the victim, it was, "They're so vicious; I’m so pitiful."
 

 
When Chen Pin played the victim, it was, "They’re so vicious; Your Majesty is so pitiful."
 

 
The audience knew her character was set up to be a bad woman, so watching her act cute and play innocent in the male lead's arms was highly entertaining and had a great comedic effect. Some viewers, with time on their hands, clipped her coquettish scenes into GIFs and memes, finding her expressions to be quite theatrical. Even without sound, she was adorably charming, perfect for "cute" reaction memes.
 

 
Discussion threads related to "The Legend of Emperor Ming" sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, drawing in a wave of female viewers who came to learn the art of "green tea."
 

 
However, after she established herself: Chen Pin stopped being "green tea."
 

 
She became "black tea," openly mocking and humiliating other concubines, becoming the little tyrant of the harem. Li Fei, who refused to believe this, relied on her higher rank to cripple a cat that Chen Pin was raising. Ostensibly, it was an accident, and she sent her head maid to deliver the dying, crippled kitten back to Chen Pin’s palace with a fake apology.
 

 
Li Fei wanted to disgust and humiliate her, and she also intended to scare her a bit.
 

 
It's just a cat; what could Chen Pin possibly do?
 

 
Unexpectedly, Chen Pin turned hostile on the spot.
 

 
She immediately ordered the young eunuch, who was skilled in martial arts and bestowed upon her by Emperor Ming, to pin down the two palace maids who admitted to crippling the cat and were arrogant and overbearing. She demanded that they receive the same punishment as the cat—broken legs. Since senior maids represent the dignity of their masters, Li Fei was furious and stormed into Chen Pin's palace to make trouble, only to find Emperor Ming already there.
 

 
Before Li Fei could cry and play the victim, the Dog Emperor provided a solution: "They're just two palace maids. Drag them out and beat them to death to settle it."
 

 
The maids' hearts sank.
 

 
"Beating them to death is such a waste," Chen Pin said, leaning on Emperor Ming's arm in front of Li Fei. She leaned so close that half of her soft body was almost resting on him, making Li Fei inwardly curse her as a vixen. "The two maids said Snowball is just an animal, thinking I wouldn't hold it against them. So, let's let them live and die like animals. When Snowball’s injuries heal, then they can recover too."
 

 
Humans can endure much more than a small cat.
 

 
In other words, even if these two maids had strong enough lives not to die, as long as the cat wasn’t fully healed, they’d be beaten to the same extent as her Snowball.
 

 
Too cruel.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
At the same time, this approach matched the newcomer's "true self" perfectly—strong and fierce. She portrayed the scorpion-like beauty with vivid realism. If her "true self" were more mediocre, one could hardly imagine such a method of retaliation.
 

 
Emperor Ming agreed, ordering others to pick two new palace maids for Li Fei, while leaving the current two for Chen Pin to "play" with.
 

 
Chen Pin still felt it wasn't enough. That night, she whispered in the Emperor’s ear on the pillow, successfully making him view Li Fei in a much worse light. The next day, her status was demoted from Li Fei to Li Pin—oh no, Yu Pin.
 

 
As for whether it was the "Yu" meaning "surplus" or the "Yu" meaning "a fish that’s destined to be eaten by a cat," who could say?
 

 
Yu Pin thanked the Emperor for the decree and then vomited blood in anger.
 

 
...
 

 
[Too ruthless, too ruthless—is this the boldness of a favored concubine?]
 

 
[Was that necessary? It’s just a cat.]
 

 
[To the commenter above, animal cruelty has been a crime for five years now. Also, from a plot perspective, Li Fei's actions were a clear provocation and humiliation of Chen Pin. In the face of imperial power, there really is no difference between a palace maid and a cat. Just enjoy the show and don’t overthink it.]
 

 
[You can only enjoy this kind of thing in movies and shows.]
 

 
[To those overanalyzing, hush! I love watching palace dramas where the villainous female lead crushes everyone! Go, go, go!]
 

 
While this controversial plot stirred debates in the discussion forums, the big data evaluations rated it as quite satisfying.
 

 
Viewers empathized with Tong Zhao’s character. If their pet had been crippled, they would be angry and upset too.
 

 
Slapping back in revenge felt good. Simple as that.
 

 
And when viewers feel satisfied, they will generously reward the show with high ratings and buzz.
 

 
It's so exhilarating!
 

 
They want to keep feeling this thrill!
 

 
※
 

 
*The Chronicles of Emperor Ming* is not a palace intrigue drama, so an antagonist can't survive until the very end.
 

 
When Tong Zhao re-entered the pod, she was filming the scenes where the imperial concubine's fortune takes a downturn.
 

 
As an external relative to the royal family, the Chen family's ambitions had always been high.
 

 
With the Empress unable to bear a legitimate son, they wanted to send another Chen woman into the palace. After the Empress, driven by sheer determination, finally gave birth to a young son, the Chen family even entertained thoughts of rebellion.
 

 
Of course, this rebellion was unsuccessful and served as a major trial for the protagonist, Emperor Ming—one of the main plotlines of the show.
 

 
A major plotline cannot go wrong, so under the tense supervision of the crew, the Chen family embarked on their rebellion with some minor scares but no major mishaps. Predictably, they were lured out and completely taken down by Emperor Ming, who had foreseen the plot all along. The whole family ended up in prison, and the Empress requested to be deposed.
 

 
Being another daughter of the Chen family, Tong Zhao's character became the target of everyone's ire.
 

 
The other concubines in the harem watched with snide comments, eager to see her downfall.
 

 
The crime committed by the Chen family this time was too severe. Her father was one of the main culprits, guilty beyond pardon. The Empress, in the end, was only spared the disgrace by being granted white silk for a dignified end.
 

 
As Tong Zhao's character was nearing her exit, the director was very satisfied: "I'm sure many viewers who watch this show will remember her vividly."
 

 
A distinctive "true self" is very well-received.
 

 
Thinking about fulfilling the wish entrusted by the goddess, the director felt particularly gratified.
 

 
Concubine De, the first to kick someone when they're down, pretended to express regret in front of Emperor Ming, saying that the harem would become lonely without the imperial concubine.
 

 
Emperor Ming frowned:
 

 
"What nonsense are you talking about? I never intended to have her executed."
# Chapter8
Concubine De was dumbfounded.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff were also stunned.
 

 
They hadn't considered the possibility that Emperor Ming might not want to have Tong Zhao killed. When "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" cast Song Wanzhuo, it was because his "true self" was such a perfect fit for the role. Emperor Ming would not be foolish on major issues; the Chen family had committed a grave crime, and how could the public be satisfied if the Chen clan was not punished?
 

 
The Empress received only a white silk, so what could the Imperial Concubine expect?
 

 
Moreover, many of the palace concubines and their factions were hoping for her death to make room for newcomers, and the previous dynasty had put a lot of pressure on Emperor Ming.
 

 
The scriptwriter had written the role of this female character as merely a tool to allow the protagonist to transform once more into a ruthless ruler.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Uh, this..."
 

 
Since, aside from the main character and the major stars who could negotiate a share of the profits, the performance fees were generally agreed upon in advance—paying per episode, with budgets not easily altered—the plot's outcome was set firmly. If the script called for the character to die by the seventh episode, the eighth episode would only show a memorial portrait if she appeared at all.
 

 
Everyone looked at each other in confusion.
 

 
The lighting technician cautiously suggested, "If you can't have her die, maybe add a temporary script change and have Tong Zhao die of illness instead?"
 

 
This was also a solution, though it was somewhat contrived.
 

 
"Let's wait and see for a while," said the director, and the group stopped discussing, secretly hoping no more issues would arise.
 

 
……
 

 
Emperor Ming really didn't want to kill her.
 

 
Since "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" had many serious scenes, Tong Zhao's role was not major. However, if the scenes of their interactions were edited separately, anyone with a bit of experience could see how sweet and affectionate their relationship was. The Imperial Concubine knew exactly how to win Emperor Ming's favor, always managing to calm him down. They had only known each other for a year, still within the honeymoon period, and he was extremely reluctant.
 

 
This was actually something Tong Zhao had anticipated before getting into character.
 

 
She had read the script, knew how her character would die, and expected that the Emperor would be reluctant to kill her.
 

 
After all, "Concubine Chen" was a persona she created with great effort in the ancient palace. If she couldn’t even win over an emperor, she couldn’t claim to be a beloved concubine and might as well find another field to farm.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was confident and calm before stepping into character.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "Concubine Chen's" mission was to become the Emperor's idealized memory after his death, once her favorability reached 100, she would find a suitable way to die. This self-destructive tendency was deeply buried in her memory, like a code waiting to be triggered at the right moment.
 

 
……
 

 
In the palace.
 

 
Concubine Chen not only did not lower her status but instead dressed exquisitely every day, making the other concubines envious of her regal appearance.
 

 
Even with her eyes narrowed like a rabbit's, it was useless; the Emperor loved her regardless.
 

 
"Yuzhi, I've been dreaming lately about the things my sister said to me before her death."
 

 
The senior maid beside Concubine Chen quickly knelt and said reassuringly, "Your Majesty, those were just the ramblings of someone who knew they had no way to deal with you. If she really had any power over you, it wouldn't have ended up like this."
 

 
Concubine Chen's palace was tightly controlled, and her behavior was so arrogant that even her servants who had followed her into the palace had picked up some of her haughty attitude. Even after death, in Yuzhi's words, she was just a blabbering fool who wanted to curse the esteemed Concubine Chen!
 

 
Before the white silk was placed, the Empress cursed Concubine Chen fiercely: "Unfaithful, unfilial, and treacherous seductress, how long can you keep the Emperor's favor with your looks? I’ll be waiting for you down there…" She sneered bitterly, "Waiting for you to fall from favor and into ruin…”
 

 
The Empress resented the rebellious concubine, resented the Emperor's indifference, and also resented the Chen family's ambition and disregard for her situation in the palace.
 

 
"Your Majesty, don’t be afraid. Should I ask the Imperial Physician for a calming remedy?"
 

 
"Afraid of her?" Concubine Chen laughed dismissively. "I’ve never been afraid since entering the palace. If I wasn’t afraid while I was alive, I certainly wouldn’t be afraid after death. As for martial skills, my sister is no match for me."
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
She had originally been just a side branch of the Chen family, unlike her elder sister who was destined to become a consort. She had climbed trees as a child and later learned to dance to win the Emperor's favor. Despite her slender limbs, she was strong, and even in the afterlife, Concubine Chen was confident she could overpower her sister.
 

 
Concubine Chen closed her eyes, and her smile faded slightly. "I had only hoped to fight for a lifetime."
 

 
The afternoon sunlight streamed through the paper windows and fell on her skin, which was as delicate as white jade, making her appear as if she was glowing.
 

 
A subplot was added to the main story: Concubine Chen had someone bring her some poison. The palace maids and eunuchs thought nothing of it. Their mistress had always been known for her pranks, like sprinkling itching powder, and even if she did manage to kill someone, what did it matter? However, they had never seen her cause a miscarriage or the death of a prince.
 

 
It seemed that the Empress's concerns were never about offspring.
 

 
Returning to the previous dynasty.
 

 
The Chen family's rebellion and the threat from an external enemy ran parallel to each other. To gain the support of another prominent clan, the Emperor had to execute the troublemaker. After the Emperor's furious reaction, he realized for the first time that being an Emperor wasn't as free and easy as he had thought. This further solidified his resolve to consolidate all power back into his own hands with the help of his trusted aides, the second and third male leads.
 

 
Although they had never met, the second and third male leads despised Concubine Chen, believing she was the cause of their problems. One scene depicted them discussing Concubine Chen, lamenting that she was indeed just an ignorant woman who refused to die for the greater good.
 

 
The director pondered, "These lines will definitely anger female viewers. Concubine Chen is a genuine scapegoat. She spends her days enjoying herself with palace maids, playing with cats and dogs, and at most, bullying other consorts. Why should she be punished with death?"
 

 
A staff member commented, "Well, that's male subconsciousness for you. It's not too extreme."
 

 
Previously, there had been public outcry over a middle-aged male actor's assertion that cheating was not a crime and that wives should be understanding. Despite the backlash, he garnered loyal support from a segment of male viewers and continued to do well.
 

 
In the study, the Emperor and the male leads were discussing state affairs when the chief steward, trembling, entered to inform the Emperor that Concubine Chen had requested an audience. She claimed that, although she was unworthy of the Emperor's favor, she had practiced a new dance and hoped to see His Majesty smile.
 

 
Concubine Chen's tone was mocking. The implication was that if the Emperor did not attend, it meant she was unworthy, and she would be heartbroken.
 

 
The faces of the two officials immediately darkened.
 

 
Screenwriter: “…”
 

 
Screenwriter: “I spent all night thinking about the plot in the Emperor’s study.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “My condolences.”
 

 
At this point, everyone on the backstage was wondering when Concubine Chen would die.
 

 
The second and third male leads were also thinking the same thing.
 

 
They wished they could personally shove a poisoned meal into her mouth.
 

 
At this moment, the more arrogant second male lead suggested that they should go together, enjoying the dance while discussing affairs, so as not to delay official matters. The third male lead immediately gave him a look, signaling him not to be too excessive. Even though their relationship was like that of close comrades, this was still too disrespectful.
 

 
The Emperor's expression remained calm, showing no sign of joy or anger. He simply asked Steward Hai to check if Concubine Chen would agree to allow the two ministers to enjoy the performance together.
 

 
Concubine Chen agreed.
 

 
The intention to humiliate the troublemaker was clear, but no one expected the woman to be so thick-skinned.
 

 
Since the ministers were going, it was naturally not appropriate to hold the event in Concubine Chen's quarters.
 

 
The palace had many places, so a suitable garden at the boundary was chosen, and a stage was set up.
 

 
“New dance? Where’s the new dance? We didn’t give her a new dance template,” the template designer suddenly realized the key issue. Some roles required unique skills to be demonstrated, and if the actor couldn’t perform them, a template or MOD had to be used. “Does Tong Zhao know how to dance?”
 

 
Everyone turned to the only person who knew Tong Zhao.
 

 
The director hesitated, “I think she studied ballet? I’ve seen her perform Swan Lake before.”
 

 
...
 

 
On-screen, Concubine Chen appeared gracefully in a water-red dance outfit.
 

 
The three men in the audience instinctively straightened their backs.
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
Her face, shaped like an egg, was adorned with vibrant makeup. Her almond-shaped eyes, with a hint of rosy hue at the corners, resembled a celestial maiden descending from the heavens. Unlike a goddess who was aloof and untouchable, she was alluring in a way that made one want to intrude.
 

 
The Emperor showed a hint of regret on his face.
 

 
He shouldn’t have let these two men enjoy the performance to prove how exceptional his beloved concubine was.
 

 
However, there was no time for him to regret it, as Concubine Chen had already begun dancing.
 

 
It was indeed a new dance.
 

 
None of the three had seen it before, nor had the template designer. It was not Swan Lake.
 

 
It was a delicate dance from another realm, performed by Concubine Chen before the Emperor, featuring delicate silver bells on her hands and ankles. The jingling of the bells created a crisp sound that cut through the seductive atmosphere with a tinkle of gold and jade.
 

 
“... If this segment is cut out on its own, Tong Zhao will definitely become popular.”
 

 
Someone muttered in a daze.
 

 
“It’s not a matter of whether she will become popular or not; the Emperor truly won’t have the heart to let her die,” the director sighed. “Let’s arrange for an urgent illness plotline.”
 

 
Concubine Chen had boasted that no man could resist her.
 

 
At that moment, everyone who saw her felt her bewitching charm. She was exquisitely beautiful, evoking a sense of wonder about what she had endured. It was as if she had crushed herself and fiercely burned away the remaining fragrance, yet it still lingered with a bittersweet allure that left hearts entranced.
 

 
After the dance, Concubine Chen deeply bowed, as if about to perform a kneeling ritual.
 

 
The Emperor suddenly stood up, hurried forward to help her, and gently lifted her chin. He saw a pale, exquisitely beautiful face hidden beneath the makeup. She parted her lips and said, "Your Majesty..." before spitting out a small amount of blood.
 

 
The Emperor was both shocked and anxious, immediately sending for the imperial physician.
 

 
"Please, Your Majesty, don’t make things difficult for yourself," Concubine Chen's eyes shone brightly, surpassing even the fireworks at the coronation ceremony: "I want you to always remember me, remember that I am your Wanwan, and love me..."
 

 
Her voice weakened, and upon seeing the Emperor’s face, she showed a pained expression, shaking her head and sighing: "Forget me, just forget me."
 

 
The poison was prepared for her.
 

 
In the parting love, there was no truth. The underlying message of “I don’t want to delay you” was “Don’t delay me, just leave quickly.”
 

 
“Forget me” was actually “You must remember me.”
 

 
She wanted him to never again hear the sound of jingling bells.
 

 
In her life, Concubine Chen had loved only two people.
 

 
One was her sister, the empress, who was a model for all women in the family, and who had urged her to enter the palace to bear children.
 

 
The other was herself.
 

 
...
 

 
The backstage after the shoot was silent.
 

 
The screenwriter trembled, "Um, I need to explain to the audience that this scene with the knife wasn’t written by me. Will they believe it?"
# Chapter9
Huff!
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her eyes, sat up straight in the filming room, and let out a long sigh.
 

 
The other actors were still in the room with their eyes closed.
 

 
Only actors who died in the scene would wake up early. Everything was still going according to her plan; the character of Shen Guifei had died.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at Song Wanzhuo in the adjacent room.
 

 
A line of transparent liquid slowly slid from the corner of his eye.
 

 
Although her memory hadn’t fully returned, it seemed Shen Guifei's death was quite impactful.
 

 
There was a glass window through which she could see the backstage of the shoot. Tong Zhao looked up and waved to the monitoring window, signaling that she was in good condition and would be out soon. The director smiled at her, but the screenwriter’s gaze was rather subtle.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked out and took a moment backstage to thank everyone.
 

 
The filming style of "Instinct" was quite different from before; it didn’t build deep connections with the crew through each scene. After all, the actors spent most of their time in another “world,” and since she was just a guest star with her character’s role done, it was time for her to leave.
 

 
"Let's have a chance to work together next time."
 

 
"You'll remember later, I didn’t expect you to dance so well, Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"Enough with the pleasantries, let’s add each other on WeChat first!"
 

 
The comment jolted everyone awake.
 

 
People quickly pulled out their QR codes to scan, and within minutes, Tong Zhao had added a lot of new contacts, all categorized under [Work] in her list.
 

 
The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
Firstly, there were no conflicts of interest; secondly, they thought she performed exceptionally well and was bound to become popular soon. Even if they couldn’t benefit from her immediately, having a future big star in their contact list was advantageous.
 

 
As she mechanically added new friends, Tong Zhao recalled how she had quietly left the set of "The Tale of Emperor Ming" in her previous life, fading away without making a sound. Only Director Jian Shu sighed and gave her work advice.
 

 
The same place, different treatment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not lament the fickleness of human nature; she was simply satisfied that the changes she made were the right ones.
 

 
---
 

 
"The Tale of Emperor Ming" is still airing.
 

 
But besides the main plot, a mysterious force has quietly emerged and become a striking feature in the viewer comments—Ming Chen and Chen Ming shippers.
 

 
A male and a female, but why is there a sequence?
 

 
Fans of the former shipper are all about the handsome emperor and his delicate consort.
 

 
Fans of the latter are all about the domineering beauty and the befuddled, lovesick emperor she has ensnared.
 

 
Among them, Song Wanzhuo's fans are the most quickly captivated.
 

 
They worry, “Will my brother really fall in love with her?”, while also thinking, “Ah, but the domineering and affectionate brother is so charming!” They found that viewing from the perspective of Consort Chen made the experience so much better, especially delightful!
 

 
What about the main plot?
 

 
This segment of the audience turned on double speed for the main plot and only returned to normal speed when Consort Chen appeared. In the script’s setting, this romantic subplot was just sugary fluff mixed in with the main course. But now, it’s like the audience kicked the whole banquet over and made the pastries the main course—sweet, sweet, sweet.
 

 
[Life is already so bitter; I just want to eat sweets.]
 

 
[It’s not just about the sweetness; I love watching Consort Chen slap faces online. Seeing her flaunt her power is so much fun! Since she’s not the main character, I worried she might suffer, but it seems Tong Zhao’s “true self” is quite domineering.]
 

 
[Not just domineering!]
 

 
---
 

 
This made the audience who were originally focused on the serious plot of **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** feel a bit uneasy.
 

 
The drama was overshadowed by the side plot.
 

 
As a result, apart from discussing the sweet moments and the plot, the comment section of the viewer's bullet chat started to fill with sour comments, especially from female viewers.
 

 
[If you want to enjoy sugary moments, go watch a romance drama! This is a historical drama; some female viewers should just back off and stop making me say unpleasant things.]
 

 
[Actually, I’ve always thought it’s good that the audience gender ratio for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is somewhat skewed, since they don't understand it anyway :D]
 

 
Anyone surfing the internet has some sense of the underlying hostility.
 

 
The targeted groups weren’t going to take it lying down, so they began to retaliate:
 

 
[No way, no way. Could there really be people who think women don’t deserve to watch historical dramas?]
 

 
[It’s quite strange. This year, the gender ratio of viewers for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is almost even. Do you think TV dramas don’t want female viewers because they’re making too much money? Are you trying to sabotage your own show? Does your master know?]
 

 
The argument ironically brought another wave of attention to the drama. Oddly, even though the debate was fierce, the criticism wasn’t directed at Tong Zhao or Consort Chen.
 

 
By the next day, the official data came out and revealed the truth.
 

 
In the era of big data, each viewer's consent before watching a show has already defaulted to data collection. The producers pay close attention to who in the show is the key to retaining viewers. With data analysis, nothing escapes scrutiny—whether a particular plot was frequently fast-forwarded or which scenes were watched repeatedly.
 

 
To get accurate numbers, the official system has a data fraud detection mechanism. Fans' mechanical repeat viewings are not counted, so the released data is the genuine version and cannot be deceived.
 

 
When the data came out, the people who had been arguing were stunned.
 

 
The ratio of male to female viewers repeatedly watching Consort Chen’s scenes was 7:3.
 

 
Male 7, Female 3.
 

 
[Oh wow…]
 

 
[Alright, there’s no difference between the dog emperor and the dog man.]
 

 
[As long as it’s a man’s show, whether in the drama or outside, does Consort Chen’s sister slay the whole scene? I almost vomited from laughing so hard at last night’s leftovers.]
 

 
Right after this, Tong Zhao thought the long-dead system had suddenly come back to life.
 

 
And it came back with two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s passive skill “Favorite Consort Aura”: Male viewers will view your work through a filter because no man can resist the charm of Consort Chen.]
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s active skill “Overwhelming Beauty”: No matter the angle or attire, Consort Chen is always the most stunning! Activation Condition - At least three women present.]
 

 
……
 

 
They were all very useful, making their way to becoming major beauties in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, am I about to undertake another mission? Or is it something else?]
 

 
System: [The host has completed all tasks in the small worlds. The system will no longer require the host to solve any tasks with annihilation as a punishment.]
 

 
After the explanation, the system fell silent.
 

 
Tong Zhao breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
After all, this is her life, and she wants to live it according to her own wishes.
 

 
Consort Chen was delightfully wicked; not only had she kickstarted Zhao Zhao’s entertainment career, but she had also activated useful skills. She was practically the most contributive one at home: [In the past, Zhao Zhao, you should have promoted me.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang coolly responded: [The consort has been promoted as much as possible. Just kill her.]
 

 
※
 

 
"Chronicles of the Ming Emperor" became increasingly popular, with viewership numbers rising.
 

 
Data showed that the character of Consort Chen was exceptionally likable, and the audience wanted to see Tong Zhao!
 

 
However, rumors spread that someone on set saw Tong Zhao leaving in a cab.
 

 
In other words, Consort Chen had met her end.
 

 
How could this be!
 

 
The fans firmly refused to accept it and demanded to see the sweet ending!
 

 
But as the episodes aired day by day, the audience began to sense something was amiss—Chen’s family’s plot to rebel gave Consort Chen a clear reason to meet her end according to ancient standards. Reluctantly, the audience began speculating about how she would die.
 

 
[It’ll probably be death by imperial decree.]
 

 
[Just look at the content of the old lady's substantial bribe to gain entry into the palace. She wanted Consort Chen to die to ensure Chen’s family’s survival, trading death for exile. It seems clear who the Emperor’s favorite truly is.]
 

 
[If it’s really due to family pressure, while it makes sense, Consort Chen’s character would lose its appeal.]
 

 
Despite the speculation, no one really wanted to see Consort Chen die.
 

 
So when the Emperor said he had no intention of granting Consort Chen’s death, the CP fans breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
See, the Emperor couldn’t bear to kill his little darling!
 

 
However, the pressure from the previous dynasty cast a shadow over the harem.
 

 
Attentive viewers noticed that Consort Chen mentioned the Empress more frequently. Since the Empress was given a white silk for her demise, Consort Chen's tone when referring to her sister had softened considerably, carrying a vague sense of regret. Some felt this was because, with the death, the grievances were forgotten, while others thought Consort Chen’s tone not only lacked hatred but also carried a hint of affection...
 

 
Affection?
 

 
How could that be? The woman who was fixated on her own child.
 

 
Distracted by this mysterious sisterly bond, the audience even felt relieved when they saw Consort Chen practicing her dance while asking for poison—see, the Consort still had the energy to harm others, she must be quite lively!
 

 
The audience watched with smiles as Consort Chen performed a dance for Emperor Ming.
 

 
The director, using all his skills, switched camera angles and zoomed in and out, allowing the audience to experience the Emperor’s perspective and become captivated by the beauty’s every move and smile, temporarily forgetting the oppressive storyline of the previous dynasty. Indeed, despite the transient adversity and gloom, Consort Chen would always be tenderly waiting in the harem, and the Emperor was determined to protect both the empire and the Consort...
 

 
As they watched this scene, the audience, in unison, displayed a blissful, drunken-like smile.
 

 
[Wuwuwu, Consort Chen is absolutely stunning!]
 

 
[No matter the floods of the previous dynasty, I just want my Consort Chen to enjoy herself every day!]
 

 
[I wonder what expression the Emperor and the two ministers have now…]
 

 
[To the person above, why don’t you look in the mirror?]
 

 
As the dance concluded, with Emperor Ming catching the fainting Consort Chen and seeing her spitting blood in his arms, the audience’s smiles froze on their faces.
 

 
Seeing Consort Chen’s final words, the audience’s smiles gradually faded.
 

 
Then, Consort Chen took her last breath.
 

 
The character's inner monologue could be extracted, but during filming, it wasn’t directly heard by the director and was only included in post-production and selectively broadcast. And Consort Chen’s final thoughts were broadcasted.
 

 
[In this lifetime, Consort Chen loved only two people.
 

 
One was her elder sister, the model for all women in the family, whom her family wanted her to enter the palace to bear children for.
 

 
The other was herself.]
 

 
......???
 

 
Where is the dog emperor???
 

 
The audience, who had just been left with a bitter taste, was stunned.
 

 
Perhaps anticipating the reaction after this episode aired, the production team quietly posted a "behind-the-scenes" photo on their official Weibo—
 

 
@TVSeriesMingEmperorExtra:
 

 
The Emperor is also crying with you [dog head emoji]
 

 
Attached was a photo of Song Wanzhuo with her eyes closed and tears streaming in the capsule.
# Chapter10
Song Wanzhuo was miserable.
 

 
When he woke up from the holographic pod, the tears in the corner of his eyes had already dried. He didn't even realize that he had been crying; he just felt an emptiness inside. How to describe that feeling...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was quite self-absorbed, with high standards for women, and had entered the entertainment industry early, so he had never been in a serious relationship. All his past flings were light-hearted and didn't leave any scars. He didn’t understand that this feeling was called losing someone he loved. While enduring the subtle gazes of the other staff members and rubbing his chin with one hand, he finally figured out what this feeling was when he returned to his room!
 

 
It was like... finding out that all the jungle monsters were cleared when playing a jungler in a game.
 

 
Or when playing mid-lane, the minion wave was pushed by the support.
 

 
Or shipping the wrong CP (couple pairing) when watching *Naruto* and *Bleach*.
 

 
A sense of melancholy, discomfort, and a feeling of never wanting to love again.
 

 
It wasn’t until the next day, during a rest day, when the memories of the movie "Instinct" came flooding back, that Song Wanzhuo clutched his chest and sat up.
 

 
"Damn!"
 

 
"My beloved consort is dead!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo moved his hand from his chest to his left cheek, let out a sob, and started to cry.
 

 
All the little moments they had shared flooded his mind, as if he had been hit with countless blows, making him see stars. His mind was filled with Consort Chen, and he even had a strange thought—it's all because *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* is a historical drama. If he had met Consort Chen in modern times, he would have resisted all the pressure from fans and married her as his wife!
 

 
"Ugh... What the hell is wrong with me..."
 

 
Overwhelmed.
 

 
Completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo grabbed his phone and dialed his agent's number. "Bro, my wife died!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Woken up at seven in the morning, the agent groggily answered, "When did you get married?"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo briefly explained the situation.
 

 
Oh, so he just couldn't get out of character.
 

 
Recalling the amount of commission Song Wanzhuo earned for him in the first half of the year, the agent's tone became more patient. "So, what do you want to do about it?"
 

 
"I want to time-travel to the modern era and date Consort Chen. I want to give her happiness. She loves me so much, but I can't give her anything..." With a slightly stuffy nose, Song Wanzhuo sounded just like a heartbroken young man. "I'm heartbroken! This is my first time being heartbroken at my age! I can't lose her!"
 

 
Suddenly, the agent was wide awake.
 

 
That evening, when Song Wanzhuo logged onto Weibo and saw that his crying photo had been posted as a behind-the-scenes snippet, his mature mindset completely collapsed.
 

 
Wah, women are all liars!
 

 
And so, the world had one more man heartbroken over Consort Chen.
 

 
※
 

 
The role of Consort Chen received a great response, which indeed gave Tong Zhao a good start.
 

 
Her type of "true self" character is quite rare, and invitations to audition for palace drama roles and female characters with femme fatale personas poured in like snowflakes. Even after Sister Chu filtered out some poorly conceived projects that were completely out of consideration, there were still quite a few options left.
 

 
After all, the demand for these types of dramas was immense.
 

 
However, since Tong Zhao was still a newcomer, there were only two roles where she would have significant screen time.
 

 
"One is the female lead, and the other is the second female lead."
 

 
Tong Zhao took a look.
 

 
The whole "family" in her mind peeked out as well.
 

 
"The Story of Consort Xi" tells the story of an orphan girl who enters the palace as a stand-in for her legitimate sister and climbs her way up to become an imperial consort.
 

 
"Palace Heart as Priority"
 

 
The first and second female leads are sisters. When they first entered the palace, they thought they would rely on each other for survival. However, the second sister was blinded by the overwhelming power and glory, gradually becoming corrupted and advancing her status by harming others. When the elder sister became the empress, the second sister even wanted to kill her and take her place. In the end, evil does not prevail over good. The merciful elder sister spared her from the death penalty and sent her to a temple to spend her days with ancient Buddha statues and oil lamps.
 

 
Consort Chen: "The first one is still passable, but what is the second one? Forget it. If I were playing the role, that Empress sister wouldn't survive past the third episode. I'd send her off joyfully the moment she gains favor."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Have you noticed that these two scripts have something in common?"
 

 
Consort Chen: "What is it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Everyone loves watching you play out sisterly yuri (girl-love) dramas."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Back in the palace... Forget it, let’s not talk about that world. Ever since I met Immortal Master Lu, I knew I would never be interested in women again in this lifetime.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped through the scripts for a while.
 

 
They were clearly targeting her recent popularity with the "empress-consort yuri vibe," but she didn't want to keep repeating herself—having multiple personalities was her advantage, and milking one personality dry would be like crippling her own skills. Although it was a pity to give up such easy opportunities, Tong Zhao still tossed those two scripts aside.
 

 
Why doesn't anyone dare to give her something different?
 

 
※
 

 
Halfway through the filming of the first season of *Star-Selected Girls*...
 

 
The members were given a week off and could return to modern life with internet access.
 

 
Xu Zhu was in a pretty good mood initially.
 

 
During the break, she could go shopping at the mall using the secondary card provided by Father Tong, and return to the Tong residence to enjoy the princess room that Tong Zhao used to live in, without having to squeeze into a dorm with those poor fellow trainees and go online to see how many new fans she had gained...
 

 
Her good mood ended the moment she got online.
 

 
Xu Zhu's WeChat messages exploded, all urging her to watch *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*.
 

 
"OMG, Xu Zhu, your sister's performance as the Consort is amazing! How did she land such a perfect role? Was it thanks to your dad? That's incredible. Other people hit countless walls before landing a role that fits them so well..."
 

 
"Ahhh, please reply to my message!"
 

 
What made Xu Zhu's heart tighten the most was a message from Ning Zhiyi, Tong Zhao's childhood friend and ex-boyfriend—
 

 
"Zhuzhu, have you watched *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*? Is the rumor about her and Song Wanzhuo true?"
 

 
After all her secret efforts, Ning Zhiyi not only broke up with the proud and stubborn Tong Zhao but also became very close to her (Xu Zhu). But now, he was concerned about whether Tong Zhao's rumored romance was true... Wait a minute, Song Wanzhuo? Brother Wanzhuo? How did they end up together? She clearly heard that after the first audition, Brother Wanzhuo was in a bad mood and wanted to replace Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu was furious and opened both Weibo and news about Tong Zhao at the same time.
 

 
Every single headline was so dazzling that it hurt her eyes.
 

 
"The Enchanting Consort Tong Zhao, the first woman to evoke real feelings in Song Wanzhuo, makes her debut."
 

 
"Unfiltered Version: Tong Zhao as Consort Chen - Scene Highlights."
 

 
"Consort Chen's Charming Bell Dance in Ultra HD (For the holographic version, please visit Channel 2 for paid viewing)."
 

 
"Epic Highlight: Consort Chen Slays in the Harem."
 

 
#SongWanzhuoTongZhao#
 

 
As Xu Zhu browsed through the topics related to Tong Zhao, seeing people genuinely discussing and praising her, Xu Zhu's chest rose and fell continuously. Drinking two sips of ice water only made her feel more nauseous. Memories flooded back—the two of them growing up as close as sisters, and in terms of appearance, academics, or talents, Tong Zhao always outshone her.
 

 
Xu Zhu blamed it all on Tong Zhao having a good mother.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother was beautiful, so her skin and features were better.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother married well, so she could live like a little princess.
 

 
Fortunately, Xu Zhu's mother won once and took it all back.
 

 
With Tong Zhenming's support, Xu Zhu felt she could finally surpass Tong Zhao in the entertainment industry!
 

 
However, the harsh reality hit her in the face. Tong Zhao's subconscious wasn't crushed by repeated blows; instead, she stood up, amazed the audience, and made them praise her "true self" for its strength...
 

 
The movie *Instinct* is a vast free market, and a ban is impossible.
 

 
The Tong family couldn't manage it, and Xu Zhu certainly didn't have the power to do so either.
 

 
Xu Zhu racked her brain, desperately thinking of a way to pull Tong Zhao down.
 

 
She couldn't think of anything.
 

 
Finally, when her peripheral vision caught sight of Ning Zhiyi's WeChat message to her, Xu Zhu had a sudden flash of inspiration and realized the key—Tong Zhao could play Consort Chen so well because her true nature was to seduce men. So, why not cast her in a completely opposite role? Dig a pit for her and mislead her.
 

 
#TongZhao#
 

 
#ZhangMengTongZhao#
 

 
Due to Consort Chen's final inner monologue elevating the hidden bond of sisterhood, a new CP (couple pairing) fanbase suddenly emerged, generating some discussion. Actually, the topic of #StarSelectedGirlsXuZhu# wasn't unpopular either, but Xu Zhu knew very well that it was all backed by a marketing company putting in paid efforts…
 

 
With a direction in mind, Xu Zhu's brain calmed down.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn't that stupid.
 

 
But what if it was a great opportunity?
 

 
She could tell the production team that her sister was actually very strong and independent in private; as long as they gave her a template to follow, she could play the role well. She could also promise that the Tong family would help invest in marketing and promotion. Xu Zhu already had this level of authority, given to her by Tong Zhenming...
 

 
At worst, she could offer Tong Zhao a female lead role.
 

 
Thanks to the Tong family’s connections working behind the scenes, Xu Zhu had quite a few scripts to choose from. However, none of them offered the first female lead; nobody dared to give such a crucial role to a newbie who had never starred in an instinct movie. The available roles were all ones that lacked difficulty. Xu Zhu went through all the scripts that the Tong family could influence and finally found an invitation.
 

 
A semi-reality apocalypse movie, *Countdown: 72 Hours*.
 

 
The role offered to Xu Zhu was that of the female lead's younger sister, a sweet and innocent character.
 

 
"This one is good."
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't overestimate herself; she felt that a character who screams for help whenever faced with trouble suited her just fine.
 

 
The female lead in *Countdown: 72 Hours* is a strong, emotionally detached woman who leads her sister to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, with a mission to complete in three days. This type of reality show-style movie became a trend after the rise of holographic consciousness filming. The audience watches the live stream online, and it is the genre where the director has the least ability to interfere.
 

 
Xu Zhu thought through the details carefully; she believed convincing the production team wouldn’t be a problem.
 

 
The problem was—
 

 
"Sigh, that woman probably won’t accept the invitation. She should just keep doing palace dramas."
 

 
Xu Zhu dug a pit with no hope of success.
# Chapter11
Tong Zhao was unaware of her stepsister's covert actions.
 

 
Even if she knew, she couldn't be bothered.
 

 
Since the role of Consort Chen became popular, all the comments on her Weibo were warmly calling her "Consort." Consort Chen was quite pleased, though Han Zhi, who managed her Weibo, was a bit frustrated: "It used to be 'brother' only."
 

 
Female reporter Liang Liang joked: "Not just that; there are also many men in the comments."
 

 
The fans attracted by Consort Chen were mostly boyfriend and husband types. With ambitions of rising to fame and marrying a gentle wife, what man with big aspirations wouldn't want a charming wife like Tong Zhao? Of course, it's just a dream—marrying her is impossible, but enjoying her performances will have to do.
 

 
The problem is, there are no new works.
 

 
They could only revisit existing clips, getting obsessed.
 

 
[Where’s the agent? Where’s the company? Hurry up and get Consort Chen new roles. Even if there are no new dramas, variety shows and interviews would do, right? They don’t even know how to dig up treasure when it’s in their hands. I’m done with this.]
 

 
[I can’t believe no one is offering Consort Chen any palace drama roles. Could it be they are too picky?]
 

 
[I’m going to die if I don’t see Consort Chen! Consort Chen, please post a selfie soon!]
 

 
The empress is anxious, not the emperor, fearing that Tong Zhao might waste her stunning start.
 

 
Tong Zhao's life has been quite fulfilling. Since her return, she has consistently practiced meditation and slow cultivation, finally achieving the effect of cleansing her bones and marrow. Her appearance has subtly improved again—she still looks like herself, but her skin can withstand any external damage. Even after ten hours of wind, rain, and sun, she still looks as smooth and flawless as jade in photos.
 

 
After the role of Consort Chen became popular, some former wealthy friends reached out to her, all celebrating and congratulating her. Tong Zhao found there was a bit of a generation gap between them, so she mostly laughed it off. The only message that caught her attention was from Wei Zekai, the only son of the Wei family.
 

 
"Tong Zhao, are you free to accompany me to the jewelry exhibition on Sunday?"
 

 
"Come on, please reply to my message. I told them that we're good friends and you could be invited, but they don’t believe it."
 

 
The Wei family is indeed very wealthy.
 

 
Wei Zekai is great in many ways, except for being narcissistic and a bit of a smart mouth. He was very loyal and had helped Tong Zhao many times in her difficult moments. However, due to Xu Zhu's manipulations and the resulting misunderstandings between them—one being unwilling to explain and the other being sensitive and fragile—they eventually fell out.
 

 
Tong Zhao is one to remember both grudges and favors.
 

 
Not recognizing good intentions in her youth, she feels the need to repay them now that she has returned.
 

 
"Sure, but I've fallen out with my family, so I don’t have suitable clothes for formal occasions. You'll have to arrange something for me."
 

 
"No problem!"
 

 
After agreeing on the meeting time, Tong Zhao recalled the jewelry exhibition in her mind.
 

 
...
 

 
In her past life, when she had ruined the Consort Chen role and was wallowing in despair in a small apartment, Wei Zekai had come with his cleaning company to help her tidy up and find a solution. However, at that time, Tong Zhao had failed to grasp the helping hand of her friend and didn't remember the invitation. She had never actually attended.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao was doing well, it was understandable why Wei Zekai’s invitation was so flattering.
 

 
He probably wanted to show off.
 

 
—My friend is amazing and has become a big star!
 

 
—I heard many people want to see her but can’t? Only this young master can get her out!
 

 
—Ha, I’m so awesome.
 

 
Tong Zhao could see through his thoughts clearly and smiled.
 

 
On Sunday, Wei Zekai indeed arrived in his Lamborghini to pick up Tong Zhao.
 

 
A seven-figure sports car was parked prominently in front of the residential area, and when the person saw Tong Zhao, he frowned. “Tong Zhao, you live in a place like this? Did your salary get swallowed up and you didn’t tell me?”
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tone was arrogant and mixed with disbelief.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how his relationships never lasted long, likely due to his low emotional intelligence.
 

 
Interpreting his words with some understanding, it meant, “This place is too rundown for you. If your salary has been swallowed up, just say so. I can help.”
 

 
“Ordinary working-class people should live here. How much can I earn from a guest role? Just getting some furniture will do,” Tong Zhao said calmly as she got into the passenger seat, reminding him, “Last time you asked me to remind you to avoid speaking too harshly. Try using a more emotionally intelligent approach.”
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment: “The place you live... it’s quite interesting.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled at him indulgently.
 

 
She thought, sigh, how naïve.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s casual outfit, Wei Zekai asked her, “Where do you get your styling done? Which place do you usually use?”
 

 
Previously, when Tong Zhao had a driver, Wei Zekai was naturally unaware.
 

 
She gave him an address, and Wei Zekai took her to a well-hidden styling salon. The staff here recognized Miss Tong immediately, and a stylist she was familiar with greeted her with a smile. Tong Zhao still had a significant balance on her membership card here, but Wei Zekai, not knowing the details, worried that her balance might run out. To avoid any awkwardness if asked whether she needed a top-up, he directly charged 100,000 yuan to the account: “You’re here to accompany me, so it should be on my account.”
 

 
In reality, among this group of rich second-generation individuals, who haven’t been rebellious and had their card suspended by their family? They all rely on their friends for support. Tong Zhao found it amusing to watch Wei Zekai think he was subtly preserving her pride.
 

 
Tong Zhao lay on a massage chair, closing her eyes to relax while the makeup artist worked on her.
 

 
The makeup artist understood her intention and left the eye makeup for last.
 

 
During the waiting period, Wei Zekai went to the men’s lounge to play video games.
 

 
Just as he was about to finish a level, the revolving door behind him was pushed open: “Mr. Wei, Miss Tong is ready.”
 

 
Originally, Wei Zekai intended to just glance over and then turn back to finish the game level first.
 

 
But when he looked over, he couldn’t take his eyes off her.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was already tall, looked even taller in her champagne-colored high heels, which made her legs appear exceptionally long and her aura extraordinary. Since she was only attending an exhibition and an evening event, she had dressed in a more modest pearl-white gown. Her hair, styled in soft waves cascading down her back, was dark and smooth.
 

 
Wei Zekai set down the game controller and quickly walked over to her, wanting to touch the ends of her hair to see if it felt as soft as he imagined.
 

 
“Don’t, big brother,” Tong Zhao said, stopping his hand: “It’s been set with hairspray.”
 

 
“Isn’t it naturally like this?”
 

 
“Who is born with such a perfect hairstyle? Straight men always say nonsense.”
 

 
Wei Zekai clicked his tongue in amazement, looking at Tong Zhao with the same awe as if he had discovered a new continent.
 

 
The gaze didn’t seem to be directed at a beautiful woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao was familiar with this kind of look. Wei Zekai usually had the same expression when seeing a brand-new figure model. If he stared too long, he would likely make a comment. She was curious to hear what Wei Zekai would say next, and a simple “beautiful” would probably exhaust his vocabulary.
 

 
Wei Zekai straightened up and gave a thumbs-up: “Impressive.”
 

 
……
 

 
She underestimated him; Tong Zhao realized.
 

 
The jewelry exhibition was hosted by a well-known domestic jewelry brand. It wasn’t very large, was not open to the public, and required an invitation to enter. Reporters were not allowed in, but Tong Zhao had still informed Chu Jie about it—she wanted to maintain control over her private life but also didn’t want her agent to be the last to know about the news.
 

 
Tong Zhao was accustomed to such events and saw some familiar faces.
 

 
In the past, when she attended similar events, she was the daughter of the Tong family.
 

 
People looked at her, but what they were really looking at was the Tong family; they had no curiosity about a rich young lady who was essentially a blank slate because everything was straightforward and apparent.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was sure that the attention she received was due to her as an individual.
 

 
“Come on, let’s go over and say hello.”
 

 
Wei Zekai accurately pinpointed where the group of rich second-generation people had gathered.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly found it amusing and graciously activated the empress consort’s special skill, “Overwhelm the Crowd with Glamour.”
 

 
Once the buff was activated, Tong Zhao didn’t feel any different.
 

 
Wei Zekai naturally led her in front of his former acquaintances. Tong Zhao knew these people, and they knew her, but the way they looked at her now was as if they had never seen her before!
 

 
Her graceful figure and the lighting at the jewelry exhibition, seemingly designed just for her, illuminated her with an otherworldly aura; she was beautiful from head to toe. Tong Zhao smiled politely at them, and the group of second-generation rich kids instantly softened.
 

 
Even though he had denied any romantic rumors, Wei Zekai still felt very proud.
 

 
His gaze at Tong Zhao now resembled Zhang Fei looking at Guan Yu—
 

 
“What a good buddy!”
 

 
At this moment, a male voice with a hint of anger came from behind them: “Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to see Ning Zhiyi, who was with Xu Zhu.
 

 
He looked at Tong Zhao with disapproval, as if being with someone like Wei Zekai was a very degenerate act. However, his disapproving gaze lasted less than three seconds before turning into a look of astonishment—
 

 
Had Tong Zhao always been this beautiful?
 

 
Xu Zhu nervously tugged at Ning Zhiyi’s sleeve and then timidly addressed them: “Wei Shao, Sister, what are you doing here…?”
 

 
The outward timidity belied the deep jealousy inside.
 

 
Sister was like a cunning fox; despite not having an invitation from their father, she still managed to cling to Wei Shao’s arm and show up boldly!
 

 
Tong Zhao now looked at Ning Zhiyi as if he were a stranger, focusing instead on her stepsister.
 

 
Seeing the confusion on Tong Zhao's beautiful face, the others turned to look at them and Tong Zhao asked, "Do we look like we’re related by blood?" She then frowned slightly, showing some discomfort as if she had been offended.
 

 
The contrast between their faces was like night and day.
 

 
After stepping into the entertainment industry, Xu Zhu’s appearance improved, upgrading from a plain neighborhood girl to a small beauty. However, she was still not on the same level as Tong Zhao. Especially with the aura of her current appearance, not even the expensive jewelry on display could rival her in prominence.
 

 
In comparison...
 

 
The two didn’t look like sisters at all.
 

 
The second-generation rich kids were very straightforward and didn’t see the need to care about Xu Zhu's feelings as an illegitimate daughter: “Not at all. Tong Zhao is much better looking.”
 

 
“I also think they don’t look alike.”
 

 
Hearing the consensus, Xu Zhu’s face showed panic. She frowned in distress, lacking the previous assertiveness she had shown when she came to confront Tong Zhao. She now played the victim. Wei Zekai was even more displeased: “Ning Zhiyi, manage your girlfriend. How did she get here? I drove her here myself.”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu became even more convinced that Tong Zhao, like the Consort, relied on men to succeed.
 

 
Tong Zhao had also said the same thing to Ning Zhiyi.
 

 
It seemed that in their mutual childhood friend’s eyes, Tong Zhao had already fallen from grace!
 

 
Ning Zhiyi looked at Tong Zhao with disappointment: "The way you appear in instinct films can’t deceive anyone. Your true nature is exactly like the Consort’s. I used to think you were different, a very independent girl.”
 

 
Well said.
 

 
If it weren’t inappropriate, Xu Zhu would have really liked to applaud him and ask him to increase the dosage.
 

 
Since the stepsister liked Ning Zhiyi, she would definitely want to prove herself after his provocation and might be more likely to take on the role in the apocalyptic film that didn’t suit her!
 

 
However, in an instant, the charming and graceful Tong Zhao changed.
 

 
While the second-generation rich kids behind her were oblivious, Ning Zhiyi, facing Tong Zhao directly, felt an overwhelming sense of hostility!
 

 
It was like an invisible sword, slicing through the air and pressing against his forehead.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao returned, she has been diligently practicing. Although she hadn’t succeeded in establishing a foundation, she had reached a state of surrounding spiritual energy. Ning Zhiyi’s words had directly awakened the dormant Lu Xianzhang within her, even making the enraged Lu Xianzhang take over her primary personality for half a minute.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, caught off guard, was so startled by the spiritual energy that he collapsed to the ground, his knees buckling.
 

 
[Let me strike him! This person’s words are just like my ex-husband’s!]
# Chapter12
[Lu Xianzhang, calm down!]
 

 
[Zhao Zhao is in a lawful society; she can’t kill people.]
 

 
Everyone tried to persuade her. Unlike usual, the Consort, who often competed with Lu Xianzhang, was now smiling happily and encouraging her: [Yes, increase the intensity. Let him underestimate this palace. So what if he relies on men? I’m a professional at relying on men. I can make the world’s supreme ruler my lapdog. Someone like him doesn’t even deserve to carry Zhao Zhao’s shoes.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, still seething with anger, used invisible sword energy to strike Ning Zhiyi’s knee before returning control to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew Ning Zhiyi wouldn’t be able to stand up for at least a cup of tea.
 

 
“Brother Zhiyi, hey, get up quickly…”
 

 
The scene of Ning Zhiyi collapsing on the spot immediately became the center of attention in the exhibition hall. Xu Zhu anxiously tried to help him up but found she didn’t have the strength. Fortunately, security guards came forward immediately. After confirming that he couldn’t stand up on his own, they had to carry him to the lounge like eagles picking up a chick.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, puzzled, asked, “What’s wrong with him?”
 

 
From the perspective of onlookers, it looked like Ning Zhiyi, who had been boasting, suddenly collapsed onto the floor and couldn’t get up.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Could he have a hidden illness?”
 

 
Second-Generation B: “Ah, we should have recorded that. We missed a great chance to get likes on social media.”
 

 
Second-Generation C: “Xu Zhu is impressive. She and Ning Zhiyi have only been seeing each other for a short time, and already Ning Zhiyi is weak in the knees in broad daylight.”
 

 
?
 

 
Everyone turned their heads in unison to look at the driver.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded in the tone of Young Master Wei: “Didn’t he say I’m the Consort? He should kneel when he sees me.”
 

 
The second-generation people hadn’t expected her to play along so well despite her delicate and otherworldly appearance. But thinking about it, since she gets along so well with Young Master Wei, how could her way of thinking be ordinary? It made sense and was quite amusing.
 

 
Tong Zhao said this while still radiating the aura of the Consort, her almond-shaped eyes holding a faint smile, subtly outlining an expensive kind of allure. Ning Zhiyi was right; a Consort fighting in the harem could only rely on men, but not everyone was worthy of her reliance. Most men who saw her subconsciously felt they only deserved to flatter the Consort.
 

 
“To pay such respect, prostration and all, what about me beside you?” Young Master Wei turned to her and asked.
 

 
This rascal has even learned how to flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao asked in return, “What do you think?”
 

 
Wei Zekai responded with caution, “I’d better keep my distance from you, or I might end up as a eunuch.”
 

 
…Well, what a talent.
 

 
In her previous life, after being heavily impacted, Tong Zhao had withdrawn into her shell like a snail, while Xu Zhu had used her thick skin and social skills to break into the circles of wealthy second-generation elites. Now that she had lived through it again, Tong Zhao thought there would be a generational gap with these second-generation elites. However, after Young Master Wei showed her off around, she found it wasn’t the case. They got along well, and after seeing the confrontation between the two, Young Master Wei assured her that he would never bring Xu Zhu into their circle in the future.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t aiming to hit her stepsister over such trivial matters, but she inadvertently closed the door on Xu Zhu’s entry into the second-generation elite circle.
 

 
After strolling for a while, Wei Zekai noticed her bare hands and asked, “Before you ran away from home, did your dad even take off the jewelry you were wearing?”
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t aware of the severity of his friend’s family issues.
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her emotional undertone cold: “I didn’t want his things. I’m not interested.”
 

 
“Well said,” Wei Zekai casually stopped at a counter selling gemstone watches. “You should appreciate what I give you. I haven’t given you a congratulatory gift for your debut success yet. How about this one?”
 

 
He picked up a starry sky watch.
 

 
The gemstones on the watch face were more striking than time itself, dazzling and attractive, and the price was equally impressive.
 

 
Even among second-generation elites, not many are so casually willing to buy a seven-figure watch for a friend, essentially wearing a car on their wrist. Wei Zekai lamented, “Watches should never be cheap. The more expensive, the better.”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked, “Any insights?”
 

 
Wei Zekai had his own harsh perspective: “When dealing with someone like Ning Zhiyi, you can tell him, ‘My time is worth a million for a full rotation. Our sense of time is very different, and you don’t deserve to have me waste it on you.’”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, but she still didn’t accept the watch.
 

 
Wei Zekai insisted on giving her a debut gift, reasoning that when he first performed in a class play in elementary school, she had also bought him a gift. Since that was a long time ago and Tong Zhao didn’t remember it, she finally relented and accepted a relatively cheaper diamond-studded bracelet watch. It looked quite nice on her slender, delicate wrist.
 

 
The friends also rallied to pool funds to buy her gifts—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, from now on, you’re the only star among us!”
 

 
“Yeah, if we want to invest in movies, it’s better to have an acquaintance than to be a naïve investor.”
 

 
“I say we should get that starry sky watch! Or just buy it; after all, Zhao Zhao has two hands, just right for the left Blue Dragon and the right White Tiger.”
 

 
“I think you’re really the Tiger.”
 

 
Finally, they settled for a sapphire necklace as a congratulatory gift.
 

 
Turning the jewelry exhibition into a shopping spree for friends was a privilege for these second-generation elites. They enjoyed the fun of choosing gifts together, and as soon as the necklace arrived, they urged Tong Zhao to put it on. Her neck was slender and elongated, and her shoulder line was impeccable. The gemstone pendant fell between her collarbones, blue like a tear from her heart.
 

 
With the aura activated, Tong Zhao exuded an ethereal grace.
 

 
However, her slightly shallow eyes, like a cat's, conveyed just the right amount of aloofness. Even if someone had watched *The Emperor Ming's Legend* and was overwhelmed by the impulse to pile all the world’s treasures in front of her, they still wouldn’t dare pursue her.
 

 
The Consort Shen felt puzzled: *“I have this strange feeling that ministers from the previous dynasty are partnering to send gifts to me…”*
 

 
Tong Zhao was both amused and touched. She didn’t just accept gifts without reciprocation; she promised that once she became familiar with the entertainment industry, she would definitely bring everyone along to earn money together.
 

 
When Wei Zekai was taking her home, he casually emphasized, “You must wear the award while wearing the gift I gave you. Otherwise, it won’t do for others to have it and you not. You’re now the representative of our little circle, the face of it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao finally recalled some memories.
 

 
She had been too young and narrow-minded back then. Even though friends had tried to help her when she was self-pitying, she hadn’t seized the opportunity. After experiencing countless worlds in fast-wear scenarios, she could now rise on her own without others' help.
 

 
But…
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
“Thank you? Saying thanks makes it seem distant between good brothers.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, the spokesperson for brotherhood like Liu, Guan, and Zhang, laughed heartily.
 

 
※
 

 
Xu Zhu and Ning Zhiyi, the troubled couple, were furious.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi lay in the medical room for a while, his legs still feeling weak. The pampered young master was terrified he might be disabled for life and urgently called his private doctor. The doctor arrived a bit late, but by the time he showed up, the residual spiritual energy on Ning Zhiyi’s knees had dissipated, and he could stand up.
 

 
Xu Zhu had never seen her refined and elegant brother in such a disheveled state.
 

 
They placed the blame squarely on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Thinking about this, Xu Zhu felt a bit better, as she had always feared that Ning Zhiyi might be taken away by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Now that she had witnessed Tong Zhao’s true nature, it was time to wake up!
 

 
Xu Zhu pleaded softly, “Brother Zhiyi, don’t blame me; she might be so cold to you because she cares about Young Master Wei.”
 

 
In reality, Xu Zhu thought Tong Zhao was simply venting her jealousy.
 

 
Tong Zhao definitely disliked her and was cold to Ning Zhiyi because of it.
 

 
This was something Ning Zhiyi shouldn’t have figured out.
 

 
Sure enough, hearing Wei’s surname made Ning Zhiyi’s expression even darker.
 

 
However, despite moving in the direction she wanted, Xu Zhu felt unexpectedly unhappy. She realized that the ambiguous object of her desire was still thinking about her more attractive stepsister. Her heart felt tightly clenched, and her meticulously made-up face showed a fierce frustration.
 

 
Why does she have to play the role of the Empress so well?
 

 
Why does Tong Zhao get everything she wants?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt unbalanced.
 

 
She became even more determined to trip Tong Zhao up. After Ning Zhiyi dropped her off at home, she immediately used her connections—provided by her father—to send the script for *Countdown 72 Hours* to Tong Zhao. She even forced herself to praise her stepsister in front of the director, convincing him that Tong Zhao was just that good and suitable.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* is a live-streamed show, so if the performance is particularly poor, there will be an audience who will pay just to watch the train wreck and have a laugh, minimizing the loss for the production team.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn’t want to offend anyone; she just wanted Tong Zhao’s reputation to be ruined.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was comfortably soaking in a bath.
 

 
Her manager, Chu Jie, was attentive to her needs. After receiving the invitation for the leading female role, she quickly got in touch to discuss it: “I’m not sure why they invited you. Let me put it this way: I remember you don’t like cilantro, right? Well, the script they sent us is like a pie filled with cilantro—extremely fragrant, but not suitable for you.”
 

 
“What’s the content? Is it really that bad?”
 

 
Tong Zhao found the analogy quite harsh.
 

 
"’ Countdown 72 Hours’ is a live-streamed apocalypse reality show. The role they offered you is that of Feng Yanqi, a decisive and individualistic heroine, which means action scenes are inevitable. And since it’s a live format, even if you’re cast as the lead, if your performance falls short compared to other characters, you might end up overshadowed, making it a risky endeavor.”
 

 
Chu Jie’s analysis was thorough: “It’s better to stick to the style of the Empress and take on similar roles that help build a stable fan base. In the future, people will think of you first for roles with that kind of positioning.”
 

 
This is the mainstream thinking for actors in the era of instinctual films.
 

 
Empress: “Oh, those who fight and kill just don’t fit in.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Indeed, if you took the role, it would be the people fighting over you rather than vaccines in the apocalypse.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Lu Xianzhang or Duan Ge would fit the role better.”
 

 
Duan Ge happens to be a persona that grew from Tong Zhao’s time in the apocalypse side story, similar to Lu Xianzhang in being taciturn.
 

 
“Lu doesn’t work,” the Empress insisted, “Sci-fi would turn into fantasy. Let’s go with Xiao Ge.”
 

 
While Lu Xianzhang disliked men, he also disdained relying on them. Although he had helped many lonely women on their cultivation journey, he mostly did so coldly and with a “give a fish, not a fishing rod” attitude, which strained his relationship with the Empress.
 

 
However, Duan Ge had a nurturing, caring attitude towards women and was well-liked by the Empress.
 

 
After drying herself off, Tong Zhao applied body lotion to her arms and thighs. "It's perfect. The role of Feng Yanqi seems like it was made just for me."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"………???"
 

 
Her manager began to question whether her ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
At that moment, as Tong Zhao was filling the bathtub, the sound of the water in her manager's ears sounded just like the water getting into their artist's head.
# Chapter13
The agent tried to persuade Tong Zhao for a while but couldn’t change her mind.
 

 
Coincidentally, the assistant director from the crew of *Countdown 72 Hours*, who was a friend of hers, was contacted to find out why the invitation was extended to Tong Zhao. The assistant director explained straightforwardly that the team felt Tong Zhao was particularly suited for the role, especially since Xu Zhu, who plays the younger sister in the female lead's role, strongly recommended her!
 

 
Well, it seemed like the whole world had lost its mind.
 

 
Sister Chu felt like she was the only sane person in the world, surrounded by confusion.
 

 
Sister Chu had no choice but to call Tong Zhao again: “It’s strange, the assistant director from *Countdown 72 Hours* said they thought you were perfect for the role, and it seems that Xu Zhu, who plays the second female lead, strongly recommended you. Do you know her?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Yes, I know her. We have a grudge.”
 

 
“Oh, a grudge? No wonder… huh????”
 

 
As Sister Chu was surprised, Tong Zhao had already figured it out—
 

 
Xu Zhu was plotting something.
 

 
A good lead role opportunity is something a newcomer would dream of. Moreover, Feng Yanqi’s character is outstanding, and if performed well, it could overshadow everyone else. Xu Zhu personally endorsing it likely means she wants to use this opportunity to undermine Tong Zhao.
 

 
But can Tong Zhao really perform well?
 

 
Xu Zhu doesn’t think so.
 

 
On the other end, the agent’s displeasure was evident: “It’s a good thing I asked; otherwise, we would have stepped into a pitfall. I’ll decline the invitation now. We won’t work with Xu Zhu or any of her associated projects in the future.” Sister Chu didn’t delve into the details of their grudge, as such situations are too common in the entertainment industry. She always respects the artists' wishes, and being forced into roles is the worst thing.
 

 
“There’s no need to decline. I’m taking this role.”
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s understanding of Xu Zhu, she isn’t someone who would rely on underhanded tactics.
 

 
Using such a direct approach means her options for covert actions are limited.
 

 
That’s a good thing.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the bed, applying transparent nail polish while discussing the details with her agent over the phone.
 

 
Consort Chen was displeased: "Red isn't pretty at all. It's like not wearing any at all."
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think it looks quite good."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Who’s playing the role this time? Is it the Lu surname or Xiao Ge?"
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Tong Zhao finally had time to join the meeting: "Originally, Lu Xianchang would have been fine, but now that I know it's my cheap stepsister playing the lead role’s younger sister... It can only be Duan Ge."
 

 
A female reporter commented wryly: "If Old Lu were in the role, Xu Zhu wouldn't last five minutes. She definitely wouldn’t be able to handle the protective sister scenes."
 

 
Lu Xianchang had no way to refute this.
 

 
She hated being betrayed by acquaintances the most and probably couldn’t stand Xu Zhu bouncing around in front of her for even a second in the indulgent movie. The drama would be too severe, though the entertainment value would be high...
 

 
"Duan Ge, is that alright?"
 

 
From the depths of her subconscious, a gentle, slightly hoarse voice surfaced:
 

 
"Of course, I’m very willing to serve Zhao Zhao.”
 

 
Duan Ge.
 

 
Her voice had become slightly fragmented due to a mild infection from the zombie virus.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mission in the post-apocalyptic scenario was not to pursue anyone but to save three key characters. She also managed to establish a settlement in the apocalypse and, as a side note, caused the heroine who was supposed to be happily paired with the male lead to fall for her instead... but that's another story. In any case, among her many derived personalities, this one had the strongest protective instinct toward women.
 

 
"Alright, thank you."
 

 
In the dead of night, only her sea of consciousness was lively.
 

 
Tong Zhao hugged her knees and let the nail polish on her hands dry, as if embracing herself.
 

 
※
 

 
@Countdown72HoursV:
 

 
The last piece of the fugitive team puzzle has been found [heart][heart]
 

 
[Give me three minutes. I need to know the details of this actor in three minutes.]
 

 
[How can you discuss things if you don’t finish talking, big brother? Don't you want the water that’s coming to you?]
 

 
[“It’s rare to find an actor who can portray Feng Yanqi well! Lin Shu and Chen Yijie are both quite capable, but weren't their schedules mismatched?”]
 

 
[Look, the official account just followed a new actress!]
 

 
One word wakes people from their dreams. The name in the latest follow on the official account dazzled netizens—
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV
 

 
Is it actually her?
 

 
Since she had just debuted, many people didn’t even remember her name, only her face. As soon as they saw that delicate face, they knew it was the Consort. She had a high approval rating from the public.
 

 
High approval rating aside, the image of Consort Chen and the character Feng Yanqi just doesn’t match!
 

 
In a semi-reality show film like "Countdown 72 Hours," each actor gets a corresponding character template but no specific action instructions, only general guidance.
 

 
In contrast, in "The Chronicle of Emperor Ming," actors know exactly what to do at certain times and places.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," actors have a lot of freedom within a set framework, so some predecessors have delivered particularly impressive performances. For example, in "The Court of Storms," the high degree of freedom allowed for intense rivalries that escalated to the level of six great kingdoms, which is still fondly discussed by drama fans today.
 

 
[Oh, this?]
 

 
[No, you can’t just pick someone based on recent popularity; it’s a recipe for disaster!]
 

 
[You need to think carefully. Feng Yanqi has the heaviest workload in the drama. If the lead actress can’t handle it, the whole group could face a disastrous ending.]
 

 
[Consort’s agent, please be more thoughtful. Don’t just grab at the first opportunity; you need to use your brain.]
 

 
[Agent: Use my brain? What does that mean?]
 

 
……
 

 
Seeing these doubts about the agent’s choices, Chu Jie’s mood deteriorated slightly.
 

 
She had put a lot of thought into it, but the artist has her own ideas.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that this role was tailor-made for her, so what could she do?
 

 
With the Tong family's connections backing her, Chu Jie inexplicably found herself on this fast track, and the production team quickly confirmed Tong Zhao's leading role. The promotion followed swiftly, making everything feel like the joy of "having influential people making things happen." Xu Zhu’s plan to tarnish Tong Zhao’s reputation and make her untouchable was to boost her fame before the shoot began.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," besides the lead character, there are also two other female roles.
 

 
If Tong Zhao doesn’t perform well, the spotlight will shift to Xu Zhu, so the current promotion is definitely not a waste, but rather a significant gain. Xu Zhu knew Tong Zhao too well. Even if Tong Zhao was indeed quite stubborn, her stubbornness was of the high-born kind.
 

 
Just like a delicate and fragile violin, even if it produces a powerful melody, it’s still not the same thing.
 

 
In Xu Zhu’s eyes, Tong Zhao was still the same as before—unable to handle provocations.
 

 
A little agitation or provocation would make her stubbornly accept a challenge with slim chances of success.
 

 
She simply wouldn't be able to perform well in "Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
...
 

 
The comments on that Weibo post were chaotic, with the majority expressing disapproval of Tong Zhao's casting.
 

 
As a newcomer, Tong Zhao was discussed with a somewhat condescending tone. Most people mocked her for overestimating herself, daring to take on any role, and being overjoyed at landing a leading role without considering if she was capable of handling the type of character.
 

 
[Trying to plant trees in the Empress’s heart, growing some pressure trees.]
 

 
[Not interested in watching anymore. Does anyone want the movie tickets I won from the lottery?]
 

 
[I want them! Why would anyone not want to watch? I’m curious to see how the Empress performs in an apocalyptic survival film. Isn’t the appeal of a live-streamed, instinctual movie in the unpredictable excitement of what might go wrong next?]
 

 
The forums were abuzz with heated discussions.
 

 
The director didn’t hire any trolls, but Xu Zhu did invest a bit to stir things up, adding fuel to the fire. The criticism was incessant.
 

 
"Let’s open the discussion: what kind of plot twists do you expect from this apocalyptic film?"
 

 
"Laughing my head off, wasn’t Sister Tang still hyping up this role a few days ago? The choice of the lead actress is just ridiculous."
 

 
Tang Jingjie, the male lead of "Countdown 72 Hours," was making his debut as the main character. Fans had been excited for days, only to be met with this shocking turn of events—
 

 
From a highly anticipated Valentine's Day release to what looks like a guaranteed flop.
 

 
Which fanbase can tolerate this?
 

 
Sister Tang couldn't take it and had to rush to the production team, privately messaging the director to reconsider.
 

 
The director, an old-school type, felt that today’s star-chasing young girls were naive and preferred to listen to familiar opinions. Since the familiar source was one who had received benefits from Xu Zhu—using Tong Zhao meant the entire promotion was taken care of by capital—it seemed like a good deal. The director shut down his Weibo and stopped paying attention.
 

 
With nowhere else to turn, Sister Tang and her team didn’t give up and desperately sought out a final option.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao opened Weibo and found that both her private messages and comments were flooded.
 

 
They were all pleas for her not to take the role.
# Chapter14
Tong Zhao was added to the production team’s WeChat group.
 

 
It happened suddenly, and someone clueless posted a screenshot of the comments on Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The screenshot was posted after she joined the group.
 

 
The props master, realizing the blunder, quickly retracted the message.
 

 
But as someone with excellent dynamic vision from her training, Tong Zhao had already seen the content. Under Han Zhi’s guidance, she responded: "It’s a good way to create buzz. Anyway, I’ll perform well. We can let the netizens fuss for a couple of days without responding, and we get the heat for free. Curiosity will bring viewers."
 

 
The lead’s nonchalant response embarrassed Tang Jingjie.
 

 
After all, it was his fans who were pleading for her not to act.
 

 
Tang Jingjie: “I’ll go post on Weibo and manage this.”
 

 
His words didn’t have much effect on his fans. Having just debuted, he had mostly been in supporting roles, and his "true self" was too gentle, attracting a group of "mommy fans." In other words, he felt AAA wouldn’t help, while fans thought BBB. No mother lets her son make decisions; they follow their mom’s advice.
 

 
As a result, it made others want to exclaim, "Damn it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need, just wait for the release.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can't back out now; I've signed the contract.]
 

 
It seemed Xu Zhu was afraid Tong Zhao might come to her senses and drop the project, so she urged the production team to finalize the contract quickly to reduce uncertainty. Xu Zhu was also in the WeChat group, and seeing her stepsister’s calm demeanor, a pang of unease surfaced.
 

 
What if she really performs well?
 

 
…
 

 
It's impossible.
 

 
Even if Tong Zhao's subconscious drive is strong, she might at best avoid a complete disaster, but she won’t excel. As netizens have said, there are two more suitable actresses in the industry, but their schedules don’t align. They and the Concubine Shen aren’t of the same type, and Xu Zhu doesn’t see any good qualities for the role of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Having thought this through, Xu Zhu relaxed and continued to feign sympathy in the WeChat group.
 

 
Xu Zhu: [Everyone, keep up the good work! ^^]
 

 
Tong Zhao did not respond.
 

 
Because she turned off her phone and began meditating and cultivating.
 

 
For several days, fans of Tang Jingjie and netizens stirred up trouble without any official response. They only received a set of costume photos, indicating that the production team was adamant about using Tong Zhao. However, there were also rumors in forums that the contract had long been signed, and the list of actors had been submitted to the Instinct Film Association, leaving no room for change.
 

 
@Countdown72Hoursv
 

 
The entire escape team is assembled!
 

 
As the female lead, Tong Zhao was unquestionably placed in the first spot. Since it’s an escape film, she wasn’t given an elaborate makeup, but her looks still outshone the remaining female supporting characters. Her beautifully shaped eyes coldly stared at the camera...
 

 
The face was still the same, but there was a subtle difference from when she played the Concubine.
 

 
That difference made her seem like a different person.
 

 
Being gazed at by the Concubine felt like being subtly teased by an invisible force.
 

 
In this costume photo, Tong Zhao’s glance at anyone felt like an electric shock—painful and deeply unsettling, yet unrelated to romantic matters.
 

 
People are visual creatures, and the moment they saw this costume photo, their confidence that Tong Zhao was unsuitable for *Countdown 72 Hours* wavered.
 

 
However, the trending comments helped them reaffirm their stance.
 

 
[If it were a traditional film, I'd be more at ease / dog head]
 

 
[Makeup can change a person's demeanor, but it can't change the "true self" in a short time.]
 

 
[If I hadn't seen Tong Zhao play the Concubine, I'd be looking forward to this film, but now...]
 

 
[And the difference in appearance between the sisters in the film is so big, it doesn’t look like they are sisters.]
 

 
This perfectly captured the sense of incongruity.
 

 
If there’s any flaw in Tong Zhao’s costume photo, it’s that she’s too beautiful.
 

 
The light makeup actually accentuates the sharp contours of her features even more. Beauty cannot be hidden or covered up.
 

 
Alright, the window of opportunity has been shattered. As soon as the costume photo was released, Xu Zhu's freshly enthusiastic fanbase exploded. The post quickly turned into a battleground between fans and haters—despite both groups being relatively small at this stage, the constant bickering caused the comments and shares to surge exponentially, achieving the level of heated discussion the production team wanted.
 

 
The day of the shoot arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
Since this was Tong Zhao’s first time participating in a live-stream format film, her manager, Chu Jie, drove her to the location while explaining the key points to pay attention to.
 

 
There is a roughly five-minute delay between the shooting and the viewing to allow the AI to automatically skip parts that cannot be broadcast, such as wardrobe malfunctions during battles. Before the film ends, the actors remain connected to the cabin, and the AI filters out unnecessary time.
 

 
For instance, when sleeping.
 

 
In the film, if an actor finds a safe place to rest beforehand, and the AI scans the area for any threats, it will skip over this part of the time, making sleep seem instantaneous. However, if an actor carelessly sleeps in a location with potential threats, random events may be triggered.
 

 
"Live shooting is the most different from traditional films; it’s more like a reality show format."
 

 
Chu Jie concluded, and Tong Zhao nodded in agreement.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "The fact that this type of thing can be popular just shows that people still have too much free time."
 

 
As she spoke, the two arrived at the venue.
 

 
When Tong Zhao walked into the shooting area, the conversation momentarily ceased, and countless eyes turned toward her, focusing intently on Tong Zhao while her manager was overlooked.
 

 
Chu Jie wasn’t annoyed; in fact, she was pleased. This was a good sign.
 

 
A promising star naturally commands attention and draws others' gazes.
 

 
Since it was a major event, Tong Zhao confidently embraced the aura of being the center of attention. Her already outstanding presence became almost dreamlike. While the female attendees could resist, the male attendees were dazzled and their hearts raced.
 

 
Aside from the director and core members who had been brainwashed by the Tong family and Xu Zhu, most of the gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism.
 

 
She is indeed beautiful.
 

 
But why should she be able to play Feng Yanqi?
 

 
This is the least beauty-focused female role of the year.
 

 
Seeing everyone's attention fully focused on her stepsister, Xu Zhu's expression fell. She felt uncomfortable, with loathing and hatred filling her chest. But then she remembered that no matter how beautiful Tong Zhao was, she was still not suitable for this role, which made her feel a bit better.
 

 
Xu Zhu's tone held a hint of disdain: "Isn't she just craving attention?"
 

 
"She is the female lead."
 

 
Unfortunately, the third female role was a straightforward girl who didn't catch onto Xu Zhu's shared animosity.
 

 
Shortly after Tong Zhao's appearance, Tang Jingjie hurried over to apologize for the issues caused by fans. Tong Zhao saw his sincere attitude, his weak demeanor, and his puppy-dog look that inspired maternal affection, so she didn't bother to argue and accepted his apology.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This kid is clearly being tightly controlled by his manager.]
 

 
Empress Chen agreed: "Not bad, has potential, might survive for three days."
 

 
Han Zhi: "He is the male lead; theoretically, he should last until the end."
 

 
Empress Chen: "What I mean is, that Xiao Ge prefers soft approaches over hard ones. He’ll do well working under her if he’s this obedient."
 

 
Despite being inexplicably labeled as the head of the family, Duan Ge didn’t refute this.
 

 
Not hearing her voice, Tong Zhao only sensed that she was smiling.
 

 
The gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism, contemplation, or curiosity, but she lay down in the shooting chamber as if she didn’t notice, showing no signs of a shaken mindset.
 

 
"Please ensure all actors have their connection devices properly fitted. The instinctive filming will begin in one minute."
 

 
Unlike ordinary people, Tong Zhao’s mind felt like a shared rental apartment.
 

 
A female reporter commented: "Duan Ge is great at everything except that he talks too much while taking action. If it weren’t for the need to protect someone, it would have been better if Lu Xianchang had come instead.”
 

 
When the device came to take away her "true self," the other personalities tacitly closed the door, leaving Duan Ge in the living room to welcome guests. Overcome by a strong drowsiness, she fell into a deep sleep, as if sinking into a warm, profound ocean...

[That day was the day the conspiracy was set in motion.
 

 
The virus spread through the groundwater. People, unaware of the danger, continued to drink as usual. The mutated undead and the virus spread throughout the city, causing countless deaths in despair. What’s even more perplexing is that the mastermind behind it had no demands—he didn't seek to revolt, seize power, or gain money. He simply wanted—
 

 
All skyscrapers, TV screens, and even fallen mobile phone screens reflected a young, pale face, facing the camera and recounting his achievements: “By the time you see this video, the infection rate will have reached 99%. I intend to personally end this stupid and tedious world, but…”]
 

 
"At any time, I will always leave a window open for the smart ones," the doctor smiled. "The antidote is at the top of the Tower of Wisdom. If you haven’t directly consumed contaminated water, well... you have about three days? You can come and find your Noah’s Ark, but after I die, the tower will automatically enter a defensive state..."
 

 
Thinking about the survivors who narrowly escaped the first wave of the virus, crying in despair outside the tower and slowly dying from the virus’s torment, the doctor’s smile grew more sincere, and his eyes gradually lost focus.
 

 
Feng Yanjie and his group were stranded in a mountain cabin during a weekend outing due to a heavy rainstorm, narrowly avoiding the first wave of the virus spread and becoming some of the few sober people left in K City. Upon returning to the city center and learning about the events and causes, they realized that even a simple escape was impossible!
 

 
The first wave of the virus spread through water. After the storm, the sunny weather filled the air with diluted second-wave toxins.
 

 
In 72 hours, they would be completely assimilated into the undead.
 

 
To survive, they must go to the research institute and find the antidote.
 

 
Since this is a live-action film, the plot background cannot be too complicated to avoid losing control, so the main quest for the protagonist group is clear: survive in the zombie-infested K City and head to the research institute to obtain the antidote. Completing this mission will mean passing the game.
 

 
The main antagonist, the doctor, couldn’t find an actor to achieve a similar effect, so the film was shot using traditional methods, with data directly loaded by a template specialist. This was a clever workaround by the production team.
 

 
When the protagonist’s "true self" woke up in the film, it coincided with Tang Jingjie driving into the city. The car reconnected to the network and started playing the doctor’s speech. Initially thought to be a prank, the seriousness of the situation became apparent when they couldn’t find any employees at the gas station, and upon seeing the first zombie, they realized the gravity of the situation.
 

 
The women in the car were horrified, while only Tang Jingjie was at a convenience store some distance from the car.
 

 
[High-energy opening, bullet screens for protection]
 

 
[Ahhh, Jie, run!]
 

 
[Mommy’s heart aches, seeing how scared the child is…]
 

 
As the zombie lunged ferociously at Tang Jingjie, fans watching the holographic film also felt the rush of danger!
 

 
In an instant, a heavy thud sounded as the zombie fell.
 

 
Seeing the zombie, Tong Zhao had already gotten out of the car, holding a wrench.
 

 
The wrench was stained with dark blood, clearly the tool used to crush the zombies’ heads.
 

 
She raised an eyebrow at the male lead:
 

 
“As a physical education teacher, it’s quite reasonable for me to carry a wrench, don’t you think?”
# Chapter15
[...]
 

 
"......"
 

 
At this moment, both inside and outside the scene, the reactions of the characters and the audience were in sync.
 

 
Tong Zhao nudged the zombie lying on the ground with the tip of her shoe. After confirming that it had indeed met its end, she crouched down and reached for its waist...
 

 
"Yan Qi, what are you doing?"
 

 
Tang Jingjie, horrified by her actions, covered his mouth, trying to suppress both his urge to stop her and his urge to vomit.
 

 
The audience was also curious about what she was doing.
 

 
Even though Concubine Chen liked men, there was no way she'd go after a zombie!
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out a set of keys from the zombie's pocket. "I just noticed that the fuel dispenser over there is locked and needs a key to open it. There might also be supplies we need in the convenience store. It's always a good idea to grab the keys first."
 

 
"Oh, you really think things through."
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao headed towards the convenience store.
 

 
Tang Jingjie's legs were still weak, so he could only stand in place, awkwardly locking eyes with the zombie.
 

 
Even though this was a horror movie, this scene inexplicably had a comedic vibe.
 

 
In the car, Feng Sisi carefully got out after confirming there was no danger. She tiptoed over to Tang Jingjie and tugged at his sleeve, "Kaiyu-ge, are you okay?"
 

 
According to the plot, Song Kaiyu and Feng Yanqi were a couple.
 

 
One taught language arts, the other taught physical education.
 

 
"Countdown: 72 Hours" is a story about a couple escaping with their pampered little sister.
 

 
Due to needing to pass censorship, the setting was an imaginary foreign country, which was a bit different from the domestic environment.
 

 
[...Wait, how could the male lead be in trouble? As soon as the zombie appeared, it got its head blown off by the female lead.]
 

 
[Zombie: I'm the one who's in trouble here.]
 

 
[True, the zombie's fate is tragic. Feeling sorry for it.]
 

 
[Feeling sorry +1]
 

 
The screen was filled with sympathetic comments.
 

 
"I'm fine; Yanqi protected me."
 

 
Song Kaiyu glanced toward the convenience store, just as Tong Zhao came back carrying bags full of stuff. Her beautiful, ethereal face was calm as if she had just come back from a pleasant shopping spree at a designer store rather than having just blown a zombie's head off. Meeting their gazes, she raised an eyebrow and said, "I did leave some money behind."
 

 
If a real zombie apocalypse broke out, cash would become nothing more than waste paper.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao's reasonable action somewhat reassured the two.
 

 
The director then cuts to a shot inside the convenience store.
 

 
Sure enough, a few bills were pressed down on the cashier counter.
 

 
Tong Zhao stuffed the supplies she bought into the car, filling it to the brim. After filling up the gas tank, she also took two large barrels of extra fuel. Once everything was done, she looked back at the two who were still standing dumbfounded next to the zombie. "What’s wrong? Is this your first time seeing a zombie? Are you too reluctant to leave it? Do you want to take a picture with it before we go?"
 

 
[...Hahaha, a photo with the zombie, really?!]
 

 
[I took a screenshot. Mom will make sure Jiezai gets his dream photo!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is unbelievably cool. Her "id" is truly formidable. Thank goodness Emperor Ming dotes on her; otherwise, I suspect she'd be blowing other people's heads off in the harem.]
 

 
[The Noble Consort herself administering justice!]
 

 
These words snapped the two iron-headed fools out of their daze, and they hurriedly got back in the car.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the front passenger seat. She rolled down the window to let in some fresh air and pulled out a pack of soft Zhonghua cigarettes. She flicked the lighter in her hand, turning the act of lighting a cigarette into a display akin to playing with a small knife. With a crisp click, the cigarette lit up. She took a deep drag, finally feeling like her soul had settled back into place.
 

 
Among her many personalities, only a few were addicted to smoking—Duan Ge was one of them.
 

 
After all, the mental stress of surviving the apocalypse was overwhelming.
 

 
As Song Kaiyu's car drove into a tunnel, the surroundings darkened, leaving only the flickering flame between Tong Zhao's fingers. The light and shadow pulled her pale face into an oil-painting-like beauty, so stunning that the audience held their breath, once again reminded of how impossibly gorgeous this talented newcomer was.
 

 
However...
 

 
[Someone, give the boss a Huazi cigarette. .jpg]
 

 
[The boss smokes Zhonghua. .gif]
 

 
[Damn it, it's the member-exclusive privilege of posting animated gifs that won!]
 

 
This scene was truly stunning, prompting a popular influencer with over a million followers to casually share a Weibo post showcasing this breathtaking beauty.
 

 
@DramaLovingBoboRabbitv:
 

 
Give Brother Tong Zhao a Huazi cigarette /dog head emoji
 

 
[GIF]
 

 
Beauty is a universal currency, and with the production team riding the wave and buying some bot traffic, this GIF managed to latch onto the tail end of the trending list, stirring up some minor buzz and attracting more netizens to pay for the live viewing privileges.
 

 
Back to the car interior.
 

 
Sitting in the back seat, Feng Sisi looked deeply worried. Song Kaiyu, who was driving, also had a pale face after seeing the tragic scenes along the way. Only Tong Zhao, after finishing her cigarette, kept gazing out the window, lost in thought. The streets were eerily quiet, with scattered remains of bodies that had been devoured, and the smell of blood lingering in the air. With Tong Zhao's consent, Song Kaiyu closed all the windows.
 

 
"If I smell that stench any longer, I’m going to throw up," Song Kaiyu said with a wry smile.
 

 
The three of them headed back together, only to find that the residential apartment complex had already become a playground for rampaging zombies.
 

 
Tong Zhao quietly observed outside the apartment for a while and then made her judgment: "If water is the primary source of contamination, then Dad and Mom wouldn't have escaped the first wave. With our current combat ability, barging in would only add three more casualties. The priority now is to find the antidote that person mentioned. If Mom and Dad are still alive, as long as they stay indoors, the food at home should last for three days."
 

 
From the omniscient perspective, the audience felt that Tong Zhao made a lot of sense.
 

 
[Seems like the director wasn't wrong—Tong Zhao is quite clever.]
 

 
[The one who laughs last in palace intrigues can't possibly be a fool. The emperor is scarier than zombies, after all.]
 

 
[This is so strange. Tong Zhao's 'id' doesn't seem to plan on relying on the male lead at all. Oh, and isn't Tang Jingjie kind of just playing a background role here...]
 

 
While Sister Tang was anxiously explaining, another person also grew agitated.
 

 
Feng Sisi's eyes were red like a rabbit's, filled with tears as she shook her head, "I won't feel at ease if I can't see Mom. Sis, can't you just try? How can you say Mom is gone without even trying? How can you leave her behind?"
 

 
Xu Zhu grew up relying on her mother since she was little, and subconsciously, she cared about her mother the most.
 

 
Tong Zhao cared too.
 

 
At any given time, Duan Ge would always make the most rational decision that maximizes benefits, ensuring the survival group could go further. Even now, as she fits into the character template, she is no exception. She said, "We will come back to check on Mom's safety once we find the antidote. If she managed to avoid the first wave of the virus, she will probably need the antidote just like us."
 

 
These clear and logical words naturally calmed the viewers' minds.
 

 
From a god's-eye view, the audience is often quite demanding of the characters.
 

 
They want to see them stay composed in crises and make the right decisions with limited information.
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at Tong Zhao in disbelief but didn't refute her. She asked quietly, "Should we leave now?"
 

 
"Yes."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded her chin toward Song Kaiyu, "First, we need to find the location of the research lab, then head to the nearest gun store."
 

 
Hearing "gun store," Feng Sisi flinched a little.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't question her decision; he just asked while driving, "Yanqi, do you have a gun license? How come I didn't know?”
 

 
"I don't have one. Once we get some, I'll practice my aim. As long as I don't shoot at living people, it should be fine," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
While the internet was still working, Song Kaiyu downloaded a map of the entire city and drove to the nearest gun store. The store's door was wide open, and it was eerily silent. Feng Sisi refused to get out of the car no matter what. Tong Zhao didn't force her, nor did she ask Song Kaiyu to join her, as if she intended to act alone.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated for a moment but decided to follow her.
 

 
"If anything happens, call us on the phone," he reminded Feng Sisi, who was staying in the car.
 

 
"Can't someone stay with me?" she asked, feeling a bit abandoned.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
It was already dangerous enough for Tong Zhao to go alone. Just as Song Kaiyu was about to refuse, Tong Zhao spoke first:
 

 
"Sure, whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao had her hands in her pockets, looking indifferent.
 

 
With that, she turned around and walked into the gun store. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth, showing a look of suppressed fear, and followed her inside.
 

 
Rows of guns covered an entire wall. The two moved quietly, one in front of the other, but Song Kaiyu noticed that no matter how careful he was, he couldn't move as silently as Tong Zhao.
 

 
After making a round in the store and confirming there were no living people or zombies, they relaxed and began to search for usable weapons. Tong Zhao advised, "Don't get too greedy; you can't chew what you can't swallow. Ever played PUBG? Pick something simple and easy to use... And put down that sniper rifle. I don't want to see you using a sniper to go face-to-face with zombies."
 

 
Song Kaiyu awkwardly put down the sniper rifle he had taken a liking to.
 

 
Tong Zhao was feeling a SCAR rifle, her expression thoughtful. "I don't know why, but when I touch these guns, they feel strangely familiar. I feel like I could use them right away."
 

 
Song Kaiyu asked, "Huh? Why?"
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Maybe it's because I'm a gym teacher."
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't quite get the logic behind that, but he took advantage of the lighter mood to quickly thank his girlfriend. "Thanks for saving me back at the gas station. Otherwise, I’d probably be dead by now."
 

 
"No need to thank me; just don’t take up my PE class time anymore."
 

 
"..."
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
As Tong Zhao was loading bullets, a door was gently pushed open. Song Kaiyu, alert, aimed his gun toward the source of the sound.
 

 
In the dimly lit gun shop, his sharp silhouette made the barrage of comments explode with excitement—finally, the male lead from all those PUBG fanfics had a face.
 

 
But his coolness lasted less than three seconds. The gun in his hand sank as Tong Zhao grabbed the barrel, pushing it downward. "You haven’t loaded any bullets yet; no need to aim. That's a living person. Are you the shopkeeper? The door was locked just now. We mean no harm. Can we talk?"
 

 
Out of the storage room came a small round face wearing glasses.
 

 
The three of them kept a safe distance from each other as they began their negotiation—
 

 
Well, it was less a negotiation and more of Tong Zhao's one-sided questioning.
 

 
The round-faced girl introduced herself as Anna. She claimed to be a janitor who had escaped from the research institute. While slacking off at work, she overheard information about the dangers of drug research and decided to run away. Because she usually drank only bottled water and had boxes of Evian stockpiled at home, she assumed she would be safe as long as she hadn’t touched tap water. However, after seeing a video posted by the doctor, she panicked and hid in her cousin’s shop.
 

 
She had been hiding in the storage room earlier and only dared to come out when she saw another young woman was traveling with the man.
 

 
“The city is already in chaos. Zombies are dangerous, and living people aren’t safe either,” Anna said. “You want to go find the antidote? That's impossible. The research institute has a fully enclosed security system and laser corridors. Anyway, the doctor was right. We won't get far even if we try to escape…”
 

 
Saying this, Anna began to sob softly.
 

 
“Since you worked at the research institute, you should be very familiar with its layout. You’ll guide us when the time comes,” Tong Zhao said, naturally patting her head. “I’ll handle everything.”
 

 
“Miss Feng…”
 

 
Anna looked at the slender and tall Oriental woman with gratitude.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “At worst, we’ll die.”
 

 
Her words extinguished the sentiment like a gust of wind scattering ashes.
# Chapter16
Tong Zhao gained Anna's trust with just a few words.
 

 
Firstly, women who are often seen as sexual resources in extreme environments tend to trust other women more.
 

 
Secondly, it was Tong Zhao's body language.
 

 
She exuded a calm confidence, whether she was scavenging for weapons or interrogating Anna. The other Oriental man also seemed to follow her instructions readily. Anna had no hesitation in positioning herself as a subordinate, and after being patted on the head, her sense of security skyrocketed.
 

 
At the same time, Feng Sisi wasn’t as fortunate.
 

 
A zombie had stumbled over, seemingly noticing the commotion inside the vehicle. The wobbly zombie pressed its half-decayed face against the car window, rubbing it inquisitively. Feng Sisi was terrified, her hands trembling as she held her phone, unable to stabilize her attempt to call her sister for help. Her panicked noise only drew the zombie’s attention further, causing it to bang more aggressively on the window.
 

 
Just as Feng Sisi was on the verge of losing control, the zombie pressing against the window suddenly jerked backward.
 

 
Upon closer inspection—
 

 
It turned out that Tong Zhao had grabbed the zombie by the hair, slammed it to the ground, and then used a crowbar to smash its head.
 

 
[Victimized Zombie +1]
 

 
[Damn, the Empress's fight scenes are so cool! I want to see her in physical palace battles!]
 

 
[So Tong Zhao also knows the wonders of physical combat! Overjoyed and dancing >////<]
 

 
Audience members who watch apocalyptic survival movies generally seek visual thrills and exploration of human nature and strategic thinking in extreme environments, and Tong Zhao delivers on this visual spectacle. She is like a beautiful and graceful berserker, with every move displaying an aesthetic of precision and efficiency. Her actions, though not choreographed, feel more genuine and thrilling!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao, Feng Sisi, with red eyes, cried out:
 

 
"Why did you only just arrive? I almost died!"
 

 
Before exposing the truth and tearing her face, Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao attended middle and high school together. If anyone bullied her, as long as she sought Tong Zhao’s help, she would always rescue her from dire straits. Even the ungrateful Tong Father once remarked that the bond between them, mother and daughter, was exceptionally loyal and caring toward friends.
 

 
In contrast, after experiencing multiple worlds in quick succession and going through several reincarnations, Tong Zhao’s perspective is different. From Xu Zhu's point of view, they had only fallen out less than a year ago. Before that, whenever she sought Tong Zhao’s help, it was always with the expectation of being rescued.
 

 
Thus, the audience witnessed her authoritative demeanor in action.
 

 
“The zombies' strength is only slightly greater than that of ordinary people, but a barehanded one can't break a car window. You weren't in immediate danger, and I didn't receive your call for help; I was just handling some business. This staff member who escaped from the research institute can provide us with information on the routes inside.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s expression was indifferent as if she were dealing with a younger sister’s unreasonable tantrum.
 

 
The person involved, Anna, cowered behind Tong Zhao and weakly raised her hand: “Sorry, it’s my fault for delaying things…”
 

 
“You didn’t do anything wrong. No need to apologize.”
 

 
Tong Zhao cut off her apology, her tone still cold.
 

 
Feng Sisi, already on edge, was even more upset. She glanced at Anna and then stared in disbelief at Tong Zhao. Seeing that Tong Zhao had no intention of comforting her, she shouted, “Yes, she’s not at fault. It’s my fault for not getting killed by the zombies just now!” After yelling, she turned her head away and refused to engage.
 

 
After getting back in the car, Anna, unable to contain her curiosity, asked quietly, “Miss Feng, you were so cool when you took down the zombies earlier. Is that what Chinese martial arts look like? Are you a master at a martial arts school?”
 

 
……
 

 
[Indeed, the foreigner's “true self” is very on point.]
 

 
[No, no, no, not every Chinese person is as skilled as the empress. She’s just a master of palace intrigue.]
 

 
[Which school of palace intrigue is this? You, Empress Liyang from Yanxi Palace; me, Ip Man of Wing Chun.]
 

 
Tong Zhao waved her hand: “No, I’m just an ordinary physical education teacher.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu recalled something: “But it seems like you’ve been teaching Tai Chi recently?”
 

 
[No, shut up, Kaiyu. The misunderstanding with the foreign friend is really hard to clear up!]
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a cold look: “Yes, but my class time was taken up by too many other things. Since the school year started, I've only taught up to ‘White Crane Spreads Its Wings.’”
 

 
Hearing the familiar pronunciation of “Tai Chi” from kung fu movies, Anna's eyes lit up, increasingly convinced that Tong Zhao was a hidden expert in Chinese martial arts. She leaned in secretly and asked softly if she was a student of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment: “If I had to say, my style is more like Chen Haonan’s.”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Two traditional film actors suffer from reputation damage!]
 

 
[All I can say is, you’re both brave enough to ask and answer.]
 

 
The audience was laughing uncontrollably, not expecting an apocalypse movie to have such humor, and even more surprised that Tong Zhao’s subconscious could be such a deadpan comedian—
 

 
Her comedic effect in *The Emperor Ming's Story* was not this good!
 

 
It was strange.
 

 
How had she become so witty and sharp-tongued in such a short time?
 

 
The segment titled "The Confusing Exchange Between Chinese and Foreign Friends' True Selves" was cut out by the overjoyed publicity team and prepared for promotion by several paid marketing accounts. They didn’t expect that collaborating with Tong Zhao would be so enjoyable, with promotional material practically handed to them, leaving them with no worries.
 

 
Compared to the unreasonable and troublesome second female lead, Feng Sisi, the audience surprisingly liked the blonde, round-faced Anna more and looked forward to seeing her interactions with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Outside the show, the director sighed: “Xu Zhu didn’t grasp the cute aspects of her character, but Anna’s natural performance was very charming.”
 

 
“It was an accidental bonus. Anna was originally just a supporting role,” said the screenwriter.
 

 
To ensure the plot stayed on track and smoothly reached its conclusion, the screenwriter avoided creating impossible situations.
 

 
Anna, who escaped from the research institute, served as a tool to provide information on the institute’s layout, greatly reducing the difficulty of the high-risk strategy. Otherwise, with an average person’s capabilities, it would be extremely difficult to tackle the stringent and dangerous security systems of the research institute.
 

 
While chatting, a change occurred within the scene.
 

 
On the way to the research institute, they passed by a public restroom. Feng Sisi, who had been trying to maintain her aloof demeanor, couldn't hold it anymore and repeatedly said she needed to use the restroom: “Sister, you have to come with me this time.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her.
 

 
Anna timidly raised her hand: “Sorry, I also need to go…”
 

 
“Let’s go together.”
 

 
Tong Zhao got out of the car, intending to check it out first. The two girls, who had been holding it in under high pressure, rushed in as if granted amnesty. They had been holding it in for so long that as soon as they saw the restroom, they couldn’t hold it any longer.
 

 
Typically, at such times, smart AI would only provide a distant shot of the public restroom and footage of hand-washing. However, this time the camera followed them in and experienced viewers immediately sensed an imminent crisis.
 

 
Sure enough, when Feng Sisi pushed open the door to the last stall, a zombie that had been roused by the noise turned around and lunged at her—
 

 
Feng Sisi screamed, but her first reaction wasn’t to step back or dodge.
 

 
Instinctively, she pulled Anna, who was about to enter the adjacent stall, in front of herself!
 

 
“Sister, help me, sister!”
 

 
“Ah—”
 

 
The blonde, round-faced Anna was thrown into the zombie’s mouth, screaming in pain as a large wound was gnawed into her delicate white neck.
 

 
……
 

 
[What is this?]
 

 
[Feng Sisi is crazy! How could she be so selfish? She’s lost her mind!]
 

 
[Is there still a chance? Without Anna, how will we get into the research institute to find the antidote?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the filming set.
 

 
Director: “Props team, who put that zombie there for the door-kill scene!?”
 

 
The props team, feeling aggrieved, explained: “I lowered the zombie’s movement speed data. She just needed to dodge it. Who would have thought she’d pull Anna in front of it? Should I air-drop a map of the research institute now?”
 

 
“I want to air-drop you right now!”
 

 
The director was furious.
 

 
The situation was serious.
 

 
With the key supporting character dead, how would the main characters get into the research institute?
# Chapter17
At the moment the scream rang out, Tong Zhao charged in.
 

 
She moved swiftly, delivering a precise high kick that sent the zombie crashing against the wall. Then, using a crowbar, she smashed the zombie's head to bits, ensuring it could no longer pose any threat. Only then did she turn to embrace the falling Anna. Blood gushed from Anna’s neck wound, which had been bitten, and she tried to speak, but her shattered throat could only produce incoherent sounds.
 

 
Feng Sisi, originally worried that she might be exposed, felt a vague sense of relief upon seeing this scene.
 

 
"Sis, I-I didn’t expect there to be a zombie inside, and Anna was attacked..."
 

 
Feng Sisi, feeling both guilty and frightened, weakly showed her fear to her sister, her mind still reeling.
 

 
They were real sisters, after all; her sister surely wouldn’t turn against her over someone she had only recently met!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't respond but simply stared fixedly at Feng Sisi.
 

 
The director used the eye-tracking system to switch the camera angles, allowing the audience to see where Tong Zhao's gaze was focused at that moment:
 

 
First on Feng Sisi's eyes, then on the location where the zombie had fallen, and finally on Anna's expression, which was beginning to freeze.
 

 
Through this sequence of camera shots, most of the audience understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Anna's death had some hidden aspects.
 

 
[On one side is protecting her sister, and on the other side is a stranger she has just met—she would probably see through it but choose to keep quiet.]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Xu Zhu’s true self is so selfish. However, I’m quite interested. Such a cruel and selfish person should be very intriguing on a talent show. I want to catch up on "Star Selection Girls" now.]
 

 
[I came from "Star Selection Girls," where I was into her sweet and soft princess persona. I can't accept this change... I'm unfollowing. Compared to her, Tong Zhao and this foreign actor are much more likable and charming.]
 

 
[Speechless!! I was into the sisterly Yuri dynamic based on the plot setup, but with the younger sister being so toxic, I can’t keep up with it.]
 

 
How Tong Zhao will handle this unexpected development has become a major dilemma.
 

 
Killing someone demands a price, but Feng Sisi's crime is rather subtle.
 

 
Moreover, it would be strange for the sister to actually kill her.
 

 
If she lets her off lightly, the audience's perception of Tong Zhao will also become subtle.
 

 
The key point is—
 

 
It’s inherently inappropriate for Tong Zhao to act as a judge.
 

 
Why should she?
 

 
Yet, she’s the only one who can make this judgment. Given her previous demeanor and actions, pretending not to notice would only lead to the audience, who stand on moral high ground and love to make cold comments, steering the narrative. In this era of instinct-driven cinema, even villains and shameless people can have fan appeal. The worst is a muddled, indecisive, and mediocre personality.
 

 
It wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, but she had to take the fall.
 

 
Tong Zhao pushed away the zombie, closed the toilet lid, placed the nearly dead Anna on top, and adjusted Anna’s head to face the right way.
 

 
As the audience wondered what Tong Zhao was going to do, she cast a cold glance at Feng Sisi.
 

 
“There’s not much time left.”
 

 
In the next moment, things took an unexpected turn.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Feng Sisi’s knee with precise force, making her collapse to the ground, her knee striking the dirty, cold floor. As Feng Sisi cried out in pain, Tong Zhao grabbed her by the back of the head and forcefully pressed it down.
 

 
“Sis, what are you doing... Sis... don’t kill me…”
 

 
“Who said I’m going to kill you? I’m not like you. Murder is a grave crime.”
 

 
The director zoomed in for a close-up of Feng Sisi and then cut to a medium shot of the whole scene. Tong Zhao was pressing Feng Sisi’s head to make her bow in front of Anna. Tong Zhao had also positioned Anna’s face to ensure she could see this moment clearly: “Apologize to her.”
 

 
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. I saw the zombie as soon as I opened the door. I was scared too!"
 

 
Feng Sisi sobbed uncontrollably.
 

 
"You were scared, you could have run away, you could have asked me for help. It's really hard to believe how you’ve changed. Feng Sisi, if you truly felt guilty, you wouldn’t have lied to me just now."
 

 
With her face pressed to the floor, Feng Sisi, her dignity shattered, shouted back, "I'm your sister! You want me to apologize to a stranger and even hit me! Who is the real sister here?"
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored her and continued to press her head down until Anna, having lost too much blood, finally passed away. Then, she pulled Feng Sisi off the floor and said, "Clean yourself up and get in the car."
 

 
Feng Sisi, quietly crying, used a tissue to wipe off the dirt. With the city's water supply contaminated, she dared not turn on the faucet to wash her face, fearing contamination through her mucous membranes. Her once-white forehead was now marked with red bruises, looking pitifully tragic and forlorn.
 

 
"You’re so frightening. I really didn’t do it on purpose..."
 

 
The close-up shot clearly captured Feng Sisi’s guilty expression.
 

 
"Alright, let's say it wasn't intentional,"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around, sweeping her bangs back to reveal her smooth, full forehead. Her pale skin was almost translucent, accentuating her short, jet-black hair. Her cold, exquisite beauty momentarily made one forget their surroundings: "Someone died for you. Is it too much to ask for you to bow dozens of times in apology? Or do you want to die here like her?"
 

 
"With the blood supply to the retina being compromised from massive blood loss, Anna would soon experience dizziness and blindness. What did she feel seeing me before she died? Was she scared and helpless? My actions may seem extreme, but they were the only way to make her feel a little better in that moment."
 

 
In "The Story of Ming Emperor," Tong Zhao’s voice was soft and sweet, capable of infusing even the simplest phrases with a tender, lingering tone that stirred listeners’ hearts. On some male-dominated forums, quotes from Concubine Chen were even edited into standalone audio clips, with high download numbers.
 

 
But in "Countdown 72 Hours," the same voice was cold and sharp, with a slight rasp.
 

 
This time, female viewers found it quite satisfying.
 

 
Previously, while the audience enjoyed watching Tong Zhao's head-bowing actions, they also found it a bit strange.
 

 
After all, the female lead, Feng Yanqi, shouldn’t have such a personality.
 

 
People admire strength but also fear extreme violence.
 

 
But after Tong Zhao’s explanation, the emotional logic made sense. It highlighted her strength while still showing her softer, human side. A paranoid madman can be captivating in certain situations, but a warm, positive personality is the mainstream choice.
 

 
[Despite how brutal Tong Zhao was earlier, why do I feel she’s so warm?]
 

 
[I’ve become her fan! She’s so cool, absolutely amazing!]
 

 
[As an M, I really envy Feng Sisi...]
 

 
[I’ve already edited out the clip of Feng Sisi being forced to bow. I’m declaring it the most stress-relieving video of the year. Selfish people like her should be made to bow to Anna—bow hard and bow fiercely!]
 

 
Men are quick to solve their business in the restroom. Song Kaiyu, who was waiting in the car listening to music, was surprised to see only two people return when three had left. His girlfriend remained her usual calm self, while Feng Sisi looked particularly disheveled. Her eyes were as red as a rabbit's, clearly from crying, and her forehead was also bruised.
 

 
"What happened?"
 

 
Song Kaiyu, puzzled, took out iodine from the car's first aid kit and a bottle of mineral water, asking Feng Sisi to clean the wound on her forehead.
 

 
Feng Sisi gratefully accepted the items.
 

 
In response to Song Kaiyu’s questions, she shook her head, tears welling up at the corners of her eyes. She glanced at her sister with immense grievance, her feelings left unspoken.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t pay much attention to her performance and simply said, “Anna was attacked by a zombie in the restroom, and we couldn’t save her in time.”
 

 
Internal conflicts are detrimental to the whole team.
 

 
Under the pressing time and harsh conditions, Tong Zhao had no intention of delving further into the matter before finding the antidote.
 

 
Seeing that her sister didn’t expose her, Feng Sisi let out a quiet sigh of relief.
 

 
“Well, it can’t be helped. If I had known, I would have gone in with you. Let’s make sure we stick together next time, no matter what.” Song Kaiyu, who was unaware of the full truth, was deeply troubled. It was hard for him to accept that someone who had been with them moments ago was now dead. The sense of despair from the zombie outbreak overwhelmed him.
 

 
“Okay, Kaiyu, I’m really scared…”
 

 
The comfort she couldn’t find from her sister, she fully sought from Kaiyu.
 

 
Feng Sisi looked at him brightly.
 

 
Unfortunately, he was too preoccupied with mourning the loss of a teammate to notice her subtle advances.
 

 
He didn’t realize it, but the onlooking audience saw it all clearly.
 

 
[No way, is someone really trying to hit on the sister’s boyfriend? Did I misread the character setting? Is this really the timid and sweet younger sister? This is quite eye-opening.]
 

 
[It’s probably a case of desperation leading to a hasty solution. Is Tong Zhao’s “true self” really this bad at comforting people?]
 

 
[Huh? Are you kidding me? Tong Zhao wasn’t good enough? Every time a zombie appeared, she was the first to protect her teammates. If I were in a ranked game and encountered such a pro, I’d be scrambling to hug their leg and call them 'daddy.' Noobs who win by luck need someone to comfort them? Do they think they’re a princess or something?]
 

 
[Coming from "Star Selection Girls," I’m really disgusted...]
 

 
[This might be just instinct-driven cinema.]
 

 
Ordinary viewers were reflecting on human nature, while fans of Tang Jingjie were becoming agitated: [Monsters and demons stay away from my baby, Mama doesn’t approve of this marriage!]
 

 
[It’s normal to have a CP in acting, and being with the female lead is quite good—she can protect and take care of the baby.]
 

 
...
 

 
From similar comments, it’s clear that the proportion of Tang Jingjie’s fans who are his "mama fans" is extraordinarily high.
 

 
Back to the show.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s calm analysis of the street, zombies are light-sensitive and will only be active indoors during the day. She instructed Song Kaiyu to avoid shaded areas while driving. Sure enough, when they passed under a bridge, they spotted a zombie lying on the road, asleep.
 

 
Just as the audience was praising the female lead for her intelligence and bravery, an off-road vehicle appeared, blocking their path.
 

 
“There are other survivors in the city!”
 

 
Song Kaiyu’s eyes lit up, and Feng Sisi also became alert.
 

 
She didn’t want to continue living under her sister’s control.
 

 
After causing the woman’s death, she felt her sister wouldn’t protect her unconditionally as she used to…
 

 
“Be careful, hold your gun steady,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had previously maintained a neutral expression, showed a slight change in her demeanor, without any joy at encountering other survivors.
 

 
Deep down, Tong Zhao’s intuition warned her that, in extreme conditions, living humans could be more dangerous than zombies…
 

 
Outside the show, the entire directing team was suddenly energized.
 

 
"Alright, alright, the plot is finally getting back on track."
 

 
The somewhat irrelevant screenwriter was deeply moved: "Is the conflict I designed finally going to be put to use?"
 

 
In the setting, even if people come into contact with contaminated sources, some individuals with unique genes or constitutions don’t die immediately but instead gradually turn into zombies, becoming increasingly malevolent in the last three days.
 

 
The main characters encounter a small group of villains.
 

 
In the face of the conflict, the male lead, Song Kaiyu, showed courage and responsibility, while Feng Sisi, as an intern nurse, treated their wounds afterward, demonstrating the "every member is useful, each with their own shining qualities" trope of typical mainstream drama...
 

 
An off-road vehicle aggressively stopped their car, and a muscular Black man got out with a hockey stick:
 

 
"Hand over your supplies and women!"
 

 
He keenly spotted the Asian girl in the passenger seat, his eyes lighting up.
 

 
A woman?
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow: "Is he calling me?”
 

 
The three had been living abroad for some time and had encountered people of various qualities. They naturally did not judge others by skin color, but it was clear that the newcomer was hostile. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth and said, "I will protect you..."
 

 
"I understand English. He’s asking the women to get out of the car."
 

 
Tong Zhao expertly chambered her gun and opened the car door. "Wait for me in the car.”
# Chapter18
"Yes, get out of the car, just like that..."
 

 
Seeing that the only man was staying in the car, Tong Zhao got out alone, and the thief showed a satisfied, sinister smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao exited the car slowly, so slowly that it should have attracted the attention of a professional.
 

 
Unfortunately...
 

 
The thief in front of her wasn’t a trained police officer or a seasoned gang member but just a thug who had survived a little longer in the virus outbreak. Since the main characters lacked special abilities, the screenwriter and template team wouldn’t set up overly harsh scenarios to force their death.
 

 
In reality, if the confrontation became too dire, the director would find ways to introduce some last-minute adjustments to turn the situation around.
 

 
The thief only saw half of Tong Zhao’s body.
 

 
As she was about to fully exit the car, she suddenly drew her gun and fired multiple shots aimed at his legs, turning them into a bloody mess in an instant!
 

 
"Oh, damn it, how dare this bitch, where did she get a gun…”
 

 
The thief cried out in pain and collapsed to the ground.
 

 
Seeing that he had lost his ability to move, Tong Zhao didn’t fire another shot at him but instead aimed at the remaining people in the off-road vehicle.
 

 
...
 

 
[Damn, the princess is so fierce.]
 

 
[I actually worried about Zhao for a moment there, sorry. Here’s a virtual cigarette for Zhao.]
 

 
[Victim 1, finally taking action against living people!]
 

 
A gust of wind blew, lifting Tong Zhao’s jet-black short hair and revealing her delicate, porcelain-like white face. In stark contrast to her earlier cold demeanor in the car, she now wore a triumphant smile: “If a hockey stick and a knife are your strongest weapons, then it's time for me to set the rules of the game. Everyone get out of the car!”
 

 
The thieves were stunned.
 

 
Feng Sisi was also frightened. She grabbed Song Kaiyu's arm, nearly in tears: “Oh my God, how could my sister anger those people? Couldn’t we have just given away some of our supplies? We already left a lot at the gas station... Did she really shoot at them?”
 

 
She still hoped for a peaceful resolution through negotiation.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated but disagreed with her logic: “These people clearly aren’t good. It wouldn’t be solved just by giving up some supplies. Even if we gave everything, they might not spare us, and did you hear? They also want women.”
 

 
Feng Sisi was disheartened by his scolding.
 

 
Song Kaiyu kept his eyes fixed on the off-road vehicle, gripping his small gun tightly: “I need to find a way to help Yanqi…”
 

 
The ideal situation would be cooperation among multiple people.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the attacker, with two teammates in the car providing fire support. Unfortunately, their shooting skills were poor; they could barely manage blind shooting at zombies. It was unrealistic to expect them to accurately hit enemies during close combat. Tong Zhao didn’t want to risk being shot by her teammates, so she gave up on relying on them.
 

 
But she still handed the gun to her boyfriend, investing in a potential asset.
 

 
“Bitch!”
 

 
The accomplices in the car cursed, and a dark hole appeared. Tong Zhao shouted for everyone to get down, using the car as cover, and clenched her teeth: “Get out of the car, we have to fight them!”
 

 
Their vehicle had gasoline, and if it exploded, everyone inside would be done for.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t immediately think of this and, believing his girlfriend needed help, got out of the car without hesitation. Only Feng Sisi stayed inside the car, hiding from the bullets and refusing to come out.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her, but squeezed next to Tong Zhao: “Is there anything I can do?”
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled a cigarette from her pocket: “Light this for me.”
 

 
...
 

 
Song Kaiyu quickly used a lighter to ignite the cigarette in her mouth.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll rush out and kill them all. Don’t shoot randomly. If I get restrained, you start shooting. I’ll try to turn his body towards you... Got it?”
 

 
“Understood.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu nodded quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao examined him for a moment more, making sure he truly understood, before giving a slight nod.
 

 
The thieves continued to threaten, but upon seeing that the Asians were armed, they dared not rush in easily, resulting in a standoff.
 

 
Then, Tong Zhao heard the sound of an engine starting.
 

 
Her pupils contracted—
 

 
In a situation where they had inferior firepower, using the off-road vehicle to try and ram Song Kaiyu's ordinary car was a viable strategy. She indeed had no time left; how could she physically confront a vehicle? She wasn't a superhero.
 

 
She had to rely on the thieves' poor shooting skills, and their lack of ruthlessness compared to hers.
 

 
When the narrow path meets, the brave prevail!
 

 
"I'm going.”
 

 
Tong Zhao darted out, crouching to minimize her target area.
 

 
She didn't just rush out; she also fired her gun continuously to cover her advance. The situation unfolded as she had expected. In their panic, even though the robbers emptied their bullets, their accuracy was atrocious. By the time Tong Zhao charged into the vehicle, they had only managed to hit her thigh...
 

 
[Tong Zhao went all out!]
 

 
[Damn, slow-motion, slow-motion, I need to see this in slow-mo!]
 

 
[Give up… Slow-motion can only be watched with a purchase, oh my god, Tong Zhao's real self is so brave… Did the director implant combat skills into her memory? But such life-or-death courage can't be simulated by a template… I'm starting to get curious about the actor herself.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is amazing!!! (Very loud)]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s Superman-like performance completely conquered the audience.
 

 
“Damn…”
 

 
Even Superman can bleed and feel pain. She furrowed her brow and let out the first curse word spoken by the protagonist in the series. The remaining robbers, barely clinging to life, stared at this Eastern girl with a face younger than most white high school students with confusion and suspicion: “Who exactly are you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave them a cold glance.
 

 
With severe injuries and blood loss, the robbers' vision began to blur, and they could only see a flickering flame.
 

 
She exhaled a smoke ring and smiled: “Wing Chun.”
 

 
……
 

 
[……Hey!]
 

 
[The stereotype that all Chinese people know martial arts is hard to shake.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s teasing made me really happy :D]
 

 
“I’m just kidding; I’m actually a high school PE teacher,” Tong Zhao said, patting one of the big men’s faces, ash falling onto his nose. “You ended up in this situation because you didn’t study hard enough back in the day. Now, let me give you your last lesson.”
 

 
“Damn, the thing I hate most in life is teachers… How could a teacher possibly have such good marksmanship…”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because I had extra time after being forced to take English, math, physics, and chemistry classes, so I used that time to practice shooting.”
 

 
This was a made-up story.
 

 
There was no such plot setting.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually stubbed out the cigarette on his arm: “We Chinese believe in reincarnation. Remember to be a good person in your next life, attend classes properly, and respect women.”
 

 
She poked her head out and waved to her teammates: “Come over here.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu hurried over.
 

 
“Move the bodies from the car and bring over the supplies. We’re switching to this vehicle; it’s more durable.”
 

 
The headlights were smashed when the SUV forced them to stop earlier, and Tong Zhao didn’t want to leave any safety hazards. Plus, the SUV was better at resisting zombie attacks. Song Kaiyu was dazed by the first sentence, but since he had just said he would find a way to help his girlfriend, he gritted his teeth and carried on.
 

 
He asked quietly, “Yanqi, aren’t you scared?”
 

 
[It’s likely that our boss, Zhao, isn’t afraid of mere mortal emotions.]
 

 
[One cigarette, boundless magical power.]
 

 
[555555 The little one must be very scared. Hugs to our little hero.]
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the passenger seat of the SUV, the car’s dim light casting a glow on her nose and lips. In an instant, she looked cold and beautiful, almost unearthly, like a knife quietly shining in the dark. How could a knife have fearful emotions?
 

 
“I’m afraid. Why wouldn’t I be?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze to him, her eyes having been tested under close-up scrutiny:
 

 
“I’m afraid of death, afraid of pain, and of course, afraid of zombies. I fear everything a normal person would fear, but my emotions can be separated from my actions. I want to survive, and ideally, I want everyone to survive with me.”
 

 
For some reason, when she said the last sentence, Tong Zhao sounded unusually resolute.
 

 
One reason is that Duan Ge’s mission in the apocalypse scenario was to save specific characters. The second reason is that Duan Ge is one of the kinder personalities in Tong Zhao.
 

 
Because Duan Ge had witnessed cruelty and misfortune in the apocalypse scenario, she deeply understood the bright, warm, and soft aspects of human nature. That’s why Tong Zhao was confident in having her play the role in the film. Duan Ge would neither be an annoying saint nor a terrifying villain.
 

 
She could be ruthless in combat, but her underlying personality is gentle.
 

 
After hearing this, Song Kaiyu was speechless.
 

 
He was overwhelmed with regret.
 

 
How could he have asked such a rude question, “Aren’t you afraid?” just because his girlfriend seemed strong? Yan Qi, like him, was a human who feared pain and death, but she endured her fear to protect him and to survive.
 

 
The audience shared his thoughts.
 

 
From the start of the broadcast, Tong Zhao's portrayal had been that of a tough, no-nonsense heroine, who shows no fear. While they enjoyed the thrill and felt the show was worth the price, there was a sense of distance. After all, gods and humans are different, and the killing god was impressive.
 

 
When Tong Zhao admitted her fear, she transformed from a deity into a human.
 

 
It wasn’t that she was no longer impressive, but rather that the audience could now empathize with her.
 

 
On the barrage, fewer people were calling her "Empress," and more were starting to refer to her as "Zhao-ge," with some even calling her "Wife" and "Zhao-cub"—
 

 
Song Kaiyu gave her a long look, his eyes reddened as he awkwardly turned away. “I’ll go get our stuff.”
 

 
“Okay, bring me the makeup bag from the car.”
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
[Makeup bag 23333 It’s true that wanting to look good is a woman’s nature.]
 

 
[The empress who wouldn't step out without new clothes is back!]
 

 
Song Kaiyu thought, just like the barrage, that Tong Zhao wanted to do her makeup and found her cute, so he smiled slightly. He worried that the items in her bag might not be enough, so he asked Feng Sisi, who had been hiding in the backseat pretending to be dead, “Can I borrow the makeup bag? Your sister needs it.”
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at him in disbelief. “What time is it, and she’s still thinking about makeup?”
 

 
After speaking, she remembered that she should also touch up her makeup and mumbled, “No, I need to use mine. Just use hers.”
 

 
The audience was used to this selfish behavior from the younger sister.
 

 
Some even noted her lines as the most classic example of a petty “true self” for the second half of the year.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her and hurriedly handed the makeup bag to Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
She lit another cigarette, still holding it between her lips.
 

 
Can a woman do her makeup while smoking? The audience grew a bit curious.
 

 
At this point, Song Kaiyu had already started to reluctantly move the bodies from the car. He deserved some screen time, but Tong Zhao’s next action immediately drew the attention of the AI, and the director couldn’t bear to cut away the shot—
 

 
Tong Zhao cut open a section of her shorts, revealing the area where she had been shot.
 

 
That piece of snow-white skin had already turned into an ugly, bright red.
# Chapter19
Inside the off-road vehicle’s cargo area.
 

 
Tong Zhao, with a blank expression, took the eyebrow tweezers from the makeup bag and used a lighter to sterilize them before using them on her wound…
 

 
In instinctual films, some memories can be erased and not brought into reality.
 

 
Certain memories of torture and bed scenes, after being reviewed by professionals, are selectively erased to prevent psychological trauma for the actors. Conversely, when actors need to perform difficult action scenes, they might be given a certain level of pain exemption to boost their courage.
 

 
In instinctual films, characters only perceive it as “adrenaline kicking in” or “the pain isn’t as bad as expected.” However, *Countdown 72 Hours* doesn’t involve such high difficulty levels, so pain exemptions were never applied to the actors.
 

 
When pain exemptions are granted, the percentage is also displayed in the film.
 

 
This can be seen as a form of recognition for particularly resilient actors. Some tough male actors take pride in this, and those who endure pain above level III without exemptions often form their own small circles in WeChat groups, sharing resources and recommendations.
 

 
Mature actresses scoffed at this, saying who hasn’t experienced level IV pain?
 

 
In any case, there are currently no female actresses in this small group.
 

 
“How much of a pain exemption should be granted to Tong Zhao?”
 

 
The staff asked.
 

 
The director, focusing intently on the screen, had access to an actor’s various status indicators in an area unseen by the audience. This allows the director to detect and prevent any potential breakdowns before the actor does.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal status panel…
 

 
Was surprisingly normal.
 

 
“Don’t rush to apply the exemption. Let’s observe for now,” the director said.
 

 
The wound did not contain a complete bullet; Tong Zhao removed all the metal fragments without even furrowing her brow. The only sign of her true pain was the sweat covering her forehead and the fact that she smoked two more cigarettes.
 

 
Close up, sweat beads fell from Tong Zhao’s high-bridged nose, creating a beautiful arc that made one’s heart tremble.
 

 
The director gave her many close-ups, and she handled the intense camera work well. Despite her immense pain, her light-colored eyes occasionally lost focus and her breathing became labored. In stark contrast, her hands moved with an emotional detachment, meticulously removing each metal shard from her flesh and tossing them aside with frustration before applying a simple bandage from the off-road vehicle's first aid kit.
 

 
During this process, Song Kaiyu, who was transporting supplies, noticed her treating her own wound. Shocked and heartbroken, he hesitated to speak, afraid of disturbing her. Timing it carefully, he handed her a bottle of opened mineral water, a small packet of bread, and a small pack of sugar to replenish her energy after she finished bandaging her wound.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the mineral water and chugged it down.
 

 
“Drink slowly, be careful not to choke.”
 

 
Seeing her drink hurriedly, Song Kaiyu attentively handed her a tissue and opened the small packet of bread for her.
 

 
This scene…
 

 
He looked just like a gentle and virtuous girlfriend!
 

 
“What’s there to thank me for?” Song Kaiyu chuckled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, accepted his logic, and smiled at him, saying, “I was wrong.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile was very gentle. In this film, she smiled rarely, and when she did, it was often in a wild, over-the-top way during fight scenes, as if she was about to say ‘Why so serious?’ This tender smile was like a refreshing spring, so sweet it melted the audience’s hearts.
 

 
[Wow, wow, I finally feel the chemistry between the male and female leads after all this time!]
 

 
[The female lead looks so adorable when she smiles!]
 

 
[I’m officially a fan of Zhao Bao now!!]
 

 
[Guys can admire too.]
 

 
Song Kaiyu was momentarily stunned by her smile.
 

 
In their character relationship set up, they were a couple. Tang Jingjie had no ill feelings toward her personally and had been treating her as his girlfriend since getting into character. Now, moved by her smile, he straightforwardly held her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse but looked at the hand being held with some confusion.
 

 
In the apocalypse scenario, there were no male characters to pursue. Apart from protecting specific female characters, Duan Ge had never been in a romantic relationship, leading to a near-innocent clumsiness in handling romantic matters. To put it simply…
 

 
“Are you scared?”
 

 
Tong Zhao clasped his hand in return: “Don’t be afraid; I’m here.”
 

 
??
 

 
??
 

 
The audience was filled with question marks.
 

 
What are you talking about?
 

 
Although you’re very brave, isn’t that the male lead’s line?
 

 
It’s enough; everyone already knows you’re super brave. Let the male lead have a break!
 

 
And because Tang Jingjie’s personality is gentle, without the big-man ego of Wan Zhuo, his portrayal of Song Kaiyu smoothly accepted this setting and bumped heads with her: “It’s really reassuring to have you by my side.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite pleased.
 

 
It felt great to be trusted by a companion.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was also happy; his girlfriend was so strong and gave him a strong sense of security.
 

 
Only the scriptwriter was unhappy.
 

 
The scriptwriter repeatedly banged his head against the director's tropical fish tank: “Reverse CP! Reverse CP!”
 

 
The innocent tropical fish, clueless about what was happening, scattered in fear.

Feng Sisi noticed that no one came to persuade her to change cars and saw that the supplies had been moved. Fearing that her sister would abandon her, she walked over with a look of grievance. When she climbed into the SUV, she found the two of them cuddling together, and the warm atmosphere made her feel a pang of sadness.
 

 
It's not that she likes her brother-in-law that much.
 

 
It’s just that, seeing her sister so wronged and distressed, how can others be happy while leaving her out?
 

 
"Brother Kaiyu, are you hurt?"
 

 
Feng Sisi, noticing the bloodstains on the ground and the bandages in the trash can, rushed over anxiously: “Sis, let me see. I didn’t waste my time interning at the hospital; I do know a bit of first aid…”
 

 
“Uh,” Song Kaiyu stopped her outstretched hand and continued speaking: “I’m not hurt. By the time we got in the car, those robbers were already dead. It’s your sister who got shot in the thigh. She just used tweezers to extract the bullet fragments.”
 

 
……
 

 
This was quite awkward.
 

 
[Let the injured person take a look, Feng Sisi, you’re really something.]
 

 
[Help, my embarrassment is acting up. I really want to skip the parts with her and just watch the female lead solo.]
 

 
[To be honest, Feng Sisi is just like a useless accessory and even got Miss Anna killed.]
 

 
In all artistic works, people naturally dislike those who hold them back.
 

 
Moreover, Feng Sisi’s performance not only shows her lack of insight and usefulness but also lacks the traits of kindness and gentleness. She isn't a major villain but reveals selfish details in the finer points.
 

 
The sense of immersion is too strong.
 

 
We don’t get to see villains who are ruthless in real life, but who hasn’t encountered self-righteous and selfish people in everyday life?
 

 
However, it’s not entirely a negative evaluation.
 

 
A comment [I won't watch face-slapping dramas without Xu Zhu as the villain; that bowing scene was so relieving] received 99 likes, indicating that sometimes, the most seemingly insignificant roles can stand out and be appreciated.
 

 
"Sis, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were hurt.”
 

 
Feng Sisi, knowing she was in the wrong, apologized hesitantly.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even glance at her, opening the window and lighting a cigarette: “Let’s head to the research institute. Don’t waste time.”
 

 
Seeing that her sister was ignoring her, Feng Sisi finally panicked.
 

 
In the current situation, she had no one else to rely on besides her sister. Her previous words had a hint of living off her sister’s kindness, but since she accidentally caused Anna’s death, she felt her sister’s attitude had completely changed.
 

 
She tried to boost her favorability: “Sis, you should smoke less; it’s bad for your health.”
 

 
“Not smoking hurts.”
 

 
The camera captured Tong Zhao’s cold and refined features as if sculpted by wind and snow, immaculate and noble.
 

 
Feng Sisi was taken aback: “Huh?”
 

 
“Not smoking will hurt your mouth,” Tong Zhao clarified.
 

 
Feng Sisi fell silent, finally realizing, just a little, how selfish she had been and that she had never truly paid attention to the suffering her sister had endured.
 

 
She secretly felt relieved that her sister was always there to protect her from such physical suffering.
 

 
As nightfall approached, Tong Zhao insisted on finding a place to hide and stay as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the zombies’ attention.
 

 
Although Feng Sisi was eager to obtain the antidote as soon as possible, she dared not oppose her sister's wishes.
 

 
Soon, the changing environment confirmed that Tong Zhao’s approach was correct.
 

 
After night fell, the city became a playground for zombies. Even the slightest sound would draw their attention. The three of them hid in the car, remaining so quiet that not a single word was spoken. Feng Sisi, terrified by the sight of zombies roaming outside the car window, quietly edged closer to Tong Zhao in the darkness.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t sleep well.
 

 
With Feng Sisi on her right and Song Kaiyu on her left, how could she possibly get any rest?
 

 
This cozy scene gave the behind-the-scenes staff a sense of satisfaction as if the plot had finally gotten back on track.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Don’t get too excited. How will you get into the research institute without Anna’s fingerprint?"
 

 
Screenwriter: "And there’s a whole series of deadly traps inside. The female lead is injured... Do you think these two are useful? Maybe it's better to take the chance now to lower the difficulty inside the research institute and just have them walk straight into a ‘Grand Opening Free Antidote Giveaway’ event?"
 

 
The others glanced at him, concluding that he was rambling due to the chaos caused by the altered plot.
 

 
"No need to lower the difficulty just yet. I want to see how far the female lead can go in this apocalypse live show."
 

 
A male voice cut in, and everyone in the backstage immediately put down their work and turned to the source of the voice, including the director, who gave a respectful look: “Supervisor.”
 

 
The man referred to as the supervisor was about twenty-five years old, strikingly handsome, with tea-colored eyes that gave him a slightly stern appearance. He wore a long black trench coat, jeans, and combat boots, moving as if he had his own background music and wind.
 

 
"She’s very interesting."
 

 
The supervisor’s gaze fell on the screen, where Tong Zhao’s face, flushed with fever, was visible.
 

 
The female lead had a fever.
# Chapter20
Tong Zhao's sleeping face captured the audience’s attention.
 

 
The girl, who had been resolute and formidable like a war deity since the broadcast began, suddenly showed signs of vulnerability, making people feel even more pity and sympathy for her. One of the advantages of live broadcasts in instinct films is that both your strengths and weaknesses are visible to the audience. If you have the talent, it will shine.
 

 
With each cough, her long eyelashes fluttered lightly—
 

 
With such beauty, why endure such suffering?
 

 
Many viewers felt a pang of sorrow upon seeing this scene, and even the backstage staff were no exception. Only the cold-hearted screenwriter proudly revealed the truth: "The faster the heartbeat, the quicker the virus spreads in the blood. Combined with her injury and lowered immunity, her blood virus concentration should be higher than others."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Everyone turned to look at him.
 

 
"These are things Anna would have originally reminded them about, but now the strategy is gone..."
 

 
The screenwriter shrugged and put on an innocent expression.
 

 
Clearly, it’s not his fault!
 

 
It’s all Xuzhu’s "true self" being too selfish!
 

 
His CP was reversed and the plot was altered, which was already quite tragic!
 

 
The director pulled up Tong Zhao’s personal data, and her temperature had risen to 65%, showing signs of fever: “Besides the fever, what else is there?”
 

 
“Well, if you want to talk about this, there’s plenty more,” the screenwriter listed off: “Though she feels hot to the touch, the infected person will experience cold hands and feet, a sense of mental confusion, occasional random body pains, and an increasingly strong desire to suck blood… If Anna were still alive, or if they had cooperated every time they faced difficulties, the average value should have been around 60% by the time they reached the final level, with these symptoms being quite mild.”
 

 
But now?
 

 
The assistant director pulled up the personal data of the other two actors. Song Kaiyu was at 50%, while Feng Sisi’s was shockingly low at only 43%. This proved that playing dead and doing nothing was indeed very effective. Considering her performance every time they encountered a challenge, even knowing it was just a movie, people couldn’t help but question Xuzhu’s character.
 

 
How can we pass the final level with a patient, a bystander, and a selfish person?
 

 
Everyone's expressions changed.
 

 
Only the supervisor showed interest: “This background setting can be shown to the audience. Also, make sure to synchronize and publicly release the personal data.”
 

 
“This…”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Isn’t it what everyone loves to watch in live movies?”
 

 
The supervisor was very amiable, lacking the domineering CEO vibe, and his fox-like eyes were smiling.
 

 
But once he spoke, no one dared to contradict him. The director immediately had people act according to his instructions.
 

 
The supervisor found this little actor interesting and wanted to give her a helping hand, a favor in passing. The stubborn “true self” would suffer in silence when unnoticed, but if handled correctly, it could quickly attract fans. After all, the most loyal fans are those who have been through hardship.
 

 
Sure enough, once this newly introduced data-checking feature became familiar to the audience, the discussion heat skyrocketed exponentially.
 

 
The official sources didn’t directly indicate the relationship between infection levels and fever, but based on previous clues from the official blog about the story’s background, it was easy to deduce. Observant viewers made inferences, while those less inclined to think later received educational content, leading to the understanding of one fact—
 

 
Tong Zhao is the one who put in the most effort, so she’s the most severely infected.
 

 
Then there’s the guy who’s useless at everything, but still alive with a 43% infection rate.
 

 
[Can I say I envy Feng Sisi a lot? If I had an older sister like that, I could win just by lying down.]
 

 
[Seeing her dragging behind is so annoying.]
 

 
[My heart aches for the sister…]
 

 
In instinctive movies, the suffering of actors is the most real, leading to the emergence of a specific audience group.
 

 
They were originally reality show viewers, interested in seeing how far others could push their limits, dissatisfied with traditional movies for lacking authenticity and failing to engage the audience’s emotions. Instinctive movies perfectly cater to this hidden preference.
 

 
When this audience learned about the shooting mishaps in "Countdown 72 Hours," they flocked to watch the live stream.
 

 
Especially the video of Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove bullet fragments from her flesh.
 

 
So exciting!
 

 
Even if paying to enter now means only experiencing one-third of the content, it’s still worth it.
 

 
In instinctive movies, viruses are not just about adding a poisoning debuff.
 

 
Humans enter the holographic system with their consciousness, and the virus is another string of code. The effects of different codes vary. Because it involves human nerves, the difficulty of creating these codes is quite high. The production team usually prefers to purchase existing virus code rights because it is much cheaper and safer than creating a new virus code.
 

 
The virus code used in "Countdown 72 Hours" is codenamed [Desire].
 

 
It’s quite well-known.
 

 
Because it’s cost-effective and fits the general public's imagination of zombie viruses, it’s popular.
 

 
At a 65% infection rate, movement difficulties begin to appear.
 

 
Every virus has a ranking chart showing how long actors' “selves” were able to continue performing after reaching a certain infection level.
 

 
Some viruses that cause immediate breakdown are rarely purchased by production teams.
 

 
After all, the show must go on.
 

 
[Desire] is a more moderate choice. At the top of the ranking chart is Darren, a foreign actor from "Glacial Survival." In the freezing cold, with a 70% infection rate, he lasted 20 minutes until the rescue team arrived. It was said that the director was most worried he might attack the female lead, but fortunately, the couple was married in real life, and the female lead had just given birth to their baby. Their strong relationship helped Darren suppress his instincts.
 

 
Tong Zhao is currently at 65%.
 

 
But her challenge is not just to endure the desire to attack the living.
 

 
It’s about moving, using both mind and body to find the antidote.
 

 
[Feels like this movie might end badly, the female lead has already come a long way.]
 

 
[Not easy, and if she doesn’t find the antidote, don’t mock her.]
 

 
[Admiring how the female lead has persisted until now with a sidekick who only tags along and drags on her progress.]
 

 
[Female lead’s Weibo handle @Tongzhao, come join us in supporting the fierce and cool Empress!]
 

 
"Cough, cough..."
 

 
The Empress was awakened by the coughing.
 

 
Just after a few coughs, Song Kaiyu next to her quickly covered her mouth.
 

 
It wasn't fully dawn yet, so they couldn't cough too loudly and attract the zombies' attention.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him gratefully.
 

 
"You're running a fever...?" Song Kaiyu asked in a very low voice, leaning close to her ear.
 

 
"A little," Tong Zhao said as she touched her forehead, hesitating, "It feels different from the usual cold and fever, maybe it's a change due to the virus. Do you feel uncomfortable?"
 

 
"My throat seems a bit inflamed.”
 

 
The two of them conversed softly.
 

 
With an infection level of 50%, Song Kaiyu began to feel slight discomfort. He sympathetically held Tong Zhao's hand and said, "Even though my stamina isn't great, you can rely on me. Whatever you think I can handle, just let me do it."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Get some more sleep; it's not dawn yet."
 

 
Song Kaiyu shifted slightly, allowing Tong Zhao to lean against him.
 

 
The director captured this moment between the two with a separate shot, excluding Feng Sisi from the frame.
 

 
So what if the female is strong and the male is weak?
 

 
It can still be heartwarming and sweet.
 

 
At this moment, most of the audience sensed the chemistry between the two and began to cheer for them in the comments, hoping they could overcome the challenges together.
 

 
※
 

 
When Tong Zhao woke up, she looked much better.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was quite pleased. "Rest is indeed very important."
 

 
However, the audience with the god's-eye view knew that Tong Zhao hadn’t improved at all. Even though she was just sitting and resting, her infection level had risen by another percentage point—she looked better only because she was well-rested and had the energy to suppress her physical discomfort.
 

 
The image of a beautiful, strong, and tragic character was fully on display.
 

 
By the time Song Kaiyu drove the car to the front of the research institute, Tong Zhao’s infection level had reached 68%.
 

 
The research institute was a building about twenty stories high.
 

 
From the outside, it looked like any other office building in the city, but according to Anna, it was equipped with many security measures unfriendly to intruders. The primary challenge was how to enter the building without Anna’s fingerprint.
 

 
The building's doors were completely shut.
 

 
It wasn’t just an ordinary glass door but also a solidly closed metal door.
 

 
Neither manpower nor firearms could break it; blasting methods would be needed.
 

 
[Where’s the demolition team?]
 

 
[There’s no blasting team. It would have been great if the female lead had awakened some special power from her fever last night.]
 

 
[I’m too lazy to comment. This isn’t a supernatural theme… but I really want to see Tong Zhao in an action-packed supernatural movie. She’d be amazing! What was she doing before entering the entertainment industry? She looks like a top soldier!]
 

 
[There were rumors she was a high-end escort during the filming of "The Ming Emperor's Legend." No need to guess anymore; this woman is hard to figure out.]
 

 
Facing the challenge, Feng Sisi looked towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was a very familiar action.
 

 
Many large trucks were parked near the research institute.
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly turned her gaze to the vehicles parked nearby, focusing on one particularly long truck with an open cargo door containing steel bars.
 

 
"I have an idea."
 

 
?
 

 
What have you thought of now?
 

 
Amidst a flurry of question marks in the comments, Tong Zhao smashed all the glass windows of the truck with a wrench. She then reached inside to open the truck door, violently broke open the control panel, and, after studying the wiring for a while, called over Song Kaiyu to help bind several steel bars to the front of the driver’s seat and the passenger seat.
 

 
What was originally an unremarkable truck now had steel bars protruding from its front.
 

 
Tong Zhao then drove the off-road vehicle and forcefully maneuvered the truck, which was originally angled away from the research institute’s main gate, to face directly toward the gate.
 

 
[Hey, I have a bold idea…]
 

 
[Don’t even think about it. No one here has the guts of Zhao Ge.]
 

 
"Step back a bit. The scene might get a bit explosive soon," Tong Zhao instructed.
 

 
Due to the virus affecting her vocal cords, her once melodious voice had become faintly hoarse.
 

 
The two complied obediently and drove the off-road vehicle to the end of the street.
 

 
Next, Tong Zhao crouched down, and found the ignition wire among a tangle of wires, and after several attempts by short-circuiting the positive terminal, she finally heard the engine start! This was a vulnerability of older cars, and since the steering wheel couldn’t be unlocked, Tong Zhao had to adjust the direction in advance…
 

 
With the throttle set to maximum, the truck barreled towards the research institute’s main gate at an unstoppable, suicidal speed.
 

 
At the critical moment, Tong Zhao leaped out of the moving truck through the open door!
 

 
The steel bars acted like an ancient battering ram, smashing through the research institute’s first line of defense. The explosion door and its frame were shattered into pieces. The loud noise stirred the zombies in the city, causing a faint disturbance.
 

 
She rolled on the road and finally came to a stop, with blood slowly seeping through the bandages on her thigh.
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s infection level: 70%]
 

 
She only slightly furrowed her brows.
# Chapter21
“Yan Qi!”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao being thrown out of the truck, both the audience and Song Kaiyu felt their hearts tighten.
 

 
Song Kaiyu rushed over and helped her up.
 

 
The fall was severe, and Tong Zhao, feeling dizzy and disoriented, allowed him to hold her for a moment. The close-up that the audience saw showed her gazing at the male lead’s neck with a look of hunger as they embraced.
 

 
Was she going to bite him?
 

 
Before the tension could fully build, Tong Zhao pushed away from Song Kaiyu's embrace: “I can stand on my own.”
 

 
Tong Zhao stood still, her slender frame upright like a sword with its edge bared—something that could only be observed from a distance and not touched. Just a touch would cut, and a sword didn’t need to be embraced by anyone.
 

 
The three of them climbed through the open cargo container into the driver’s seat and then entered the research institute’s lobby through the window that had been smashed open.
 

 
Like many office buildings, the first floor had a reception desk and elevators.
 

 
The interior decoration was in disarray due to the crash. Since there might be zombies inside, Tong Zhao turned to the group and signaled for silence, and the two immediately shut up, swallowing all their questions.
 

 
The office building was too tall for Tong Zhao to search alone; she might end up poisoned or worse before finding anything. The intelligent AI, detecting the importance of the scene to the plot, broadcasted Tong Zhao's inner monologue at this moment:
 

 
[My physical condition is getting worse. It’s definitely more than just a fever or a cold; the virus must be starting to take effect... Ha, it seems like we don’t have much time left. Or maybe I inadvertently did something that accelerated the virus activation? Forget it, I’ll put that aside for now.]
 

 
The protagonist is truly intelligent!
 

 
Watching a resourceful and capable hero navigate challenges is quite enjoyable.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the injured beauty face these trials makes the audience feel closer to her, evoking a sense of sympathy and hope that fate will be kinder to her.
 

 
With the guide, Anna, having fallen earlier, the director added a schematic map code at the research institute’s reception, essentially providing a map. Tong Zhao looked up at the plastic board nailed to the wall.
 

 
The doctor’s laboratory was on the top floor, the 23rd.
 

 
The elevator was still operational, sparing the three from the grueling climb up the stairs and accelerating their infection.
 

 
In the original script, they were supposed to climb, but the props team estimated that Tong Zhao might become so aggressive during the climb that she could potentially kill the other two. Therefore, the script was changed to allow the use of the elevator.
 

 
However, the elevator only went up to the 20th floor, so they would have to walk the remaining three floors.
 

 
The 21st and 22nd floors were designated as staff dormitories and patient wards respectively. After the virus outbreak, those who hadn’t escaped would likely have become hungry zombies, and they would need to pass through these two floors to reach the 23rd.
 

 
Tong Zhao informed the others of her conclusions.
 

 
“After reaching the 20th floor, we’ll definitely have to fight zombies,”
 

 
Her light-colored eyes were filled with coldness, and her grip on the gun was tight. Only the audience with the God’s-eye view knew that she was barely holding back the murderous urges caused by the virus and had no time to act kindly: “If you’re scared or want to stay back and wait for me to protect you, you can stay here and wait for me to bring back the antidote.”
 

 
“I’ll stay here, so I won’t be a burden to my sister.”
 

 
Feng Sisi quickly made her choice.
 

 
Song Kaiyu pressed his lips together, showing the resolute demeanor expected of a man: “There’s no way I’m letting you go alone. I’ll follow you. Even if it’s just firing at zombies, having an extra person means more firepower. I won’t back down in the face of danger.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, slightly moved.
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Feng Sisi tugged at her sister’s sleeve with a pleading expression: “Don’t leave me alone again. It might not be safe here; there could be zombies sneaking in... What if you don’t get the antidote? Am I just supposed to wait here to die?”
 

 
She was genuinely anxious.
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Help, Feng Sisi is so selfish! Even the screenwriter couldn’t come up with this level of selfishness. Is she only thinking about herself?]
 

 
[How many good deeds did she do in her past life to be reborn as the female lead’s sister?]
 

 
[I accept that her values are skewed, but I really want to see Tong Zhao give her a couple of shots! Autumn pear syrup!]
 

 
Tong Zhao looked down at her, her expressive almond-shaped eyes showing no emotion.
 

 
“Yeah, wait here to die, what else?”
 

 
She spoke with a hint of curiosity, her voice even more hoarse: “Do you think I’m guaranteed to find the antidote? That I’m certain to survive? Stop dreaming. We should have died a long time ago. Right now, we’re just fighting for a sliver of hope in the hands of death. Don’t expect me to rely on you. Just stay put and wait.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice was no longer pleasant to hear.
 

 
It was used for mockery, giving it a different flavor.
 

 
“I don’t mind if you’re useless or foolish, but you’d better obey.”
 

 
She suddenly frowned, biting her lower lip until it cracked and bled.
 

 
“I, I…”
 

 
Feng Sisi was left speechless, her face pale and filled with grievance as she looked at her, silently accusing her of cruelty. Tong Zhao, however, had no interest in watching her performance and asked, “Last chance—will you come with me or stay here?”
 

 
Feng Sisi opened her mouth and then shut it again, finally whispering with tears in her eyes, “I’m too scared to go up…”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t waste any more words with her. She grabbed her by the hair and dragged her onto the truck, then hoisted her up and shoved her head-first into the cargo area. “Stay here. If you don’t want to die, don’t make any noise.”
 

 
This kind of rough, trash-like behavior was unanimously approved by the audience.
 

 
Feng Sisi’s character had gone from being the group’s favorite to a much-despised “green tea sister.” If Tong Zhao were too kind to her, she’d be criticized as a saint.
 

 
Besides, Tong Zhao was right.
 

 
In a life-or-death escape, who has time for such pretentiousness?
 

 
Also, it was the older sister’s protection that had shielded her from hardship, but live-action films have no time for gradual character development. The stronger get stronger, and the foolish remain foolish—an unchanging rule.
 

 
The sun blazed, and everything was laid bare.
 

 
The two of them entered the elevator.
 

 
“Yan Qi, your voice is really hoarse,” Song Kaiyu noticed something.
 

 
“The virus is starting to take effect,” Tong Zhao smiled, recognizing that his voice hadn’t changed yet. “I’m experiencing it worse than you. If I completely lose control and attack you, just…”
 

 
“Then let’s die together.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu interrupted her.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised her eyebrows.
 

 
“I have to admit I’m a rather weak man. I don’t have the resolve to shoot my girlfriend. If one of us is going to survive, it should definitely be you.”
 

 
The elevator was rising quickly, so quickly that she was starting to get a bit of ear pressure.
 

 
Their situations were the same, and Song Kaiyu reached out to touch her ear. “If eating me when the virus takes over makes you feel a bit better, then I’m happy to finally be of some use in this escape journey.”
 

 
With this joking remark, the elevator arrived at the 20th floor.
 

 
The elevator doors slowly opened.
 

 
They had already heard many heavy, dense footsteps, but none of the steps were hesitant.
 

 
[I think, Feng Sisi will never know what she missed.]
 

 
[Can the romance of a strong woman and a weak man be this touching? I’m teary-eyed.]
 

 
[The writer is amazing!!]
 

 
The writer, feeling a mix of emotions and not daring to claim credit, posted a tweet:
 

 
@DailyScriptwriterQiao:
 

 
“The current plot of ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ compared to my script…
 

 
I can’t say it’s identical, but I can say it’s entirely unrelated.”
 

 
*
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, the 21st and 22nd floors were like scenes from hell.
 

 
Fortunately, the two were well-prepared with ample firepower, unloading magazine after magazine. As Song Kaiyu’s hands began to tremble from firing so much, Tong Zhao's infection level visibly soared, peaking from 70% to 80%. In the grand scene, every close-up shot was given to Tong Zhao, while the male lead didn’t get any close-ups.
 

 
Because she was in immense pain.
 

 
Her lower lip was bitten raw, and her beautiful eyes were half-stained gray.
 

 
The zombie horde wouldn’t give them a chance for close combat. The small knife Tong Zhao had prepared was used to cut herself, on her arms, thighs, and shoulders, inflicting pain where it was needed to maintain a minimal level of awareness. By the time they reached the stairway from the 22nd to the 23rd floor, Tong Zhao could no longer move and had to collapse in the stairwell, signaling Song Kaiyu to go up to the 23rd floor to find the antidote.
 

 
Since Song Kaiyu had been relatively unaffected, his lower infection level allowed him to search through all the bottles and jars on the top floor and find the antidote for 【Desire】. This was the margin Tong Zhao had fought to secure for him, and he seized it, grasping the faint glimmer of hope offered by death. Returning to the unconscious Tong Zhao, he personally administered the antidote to her...
 

 
As if fate had already made its arrangements.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, who had been a background character throughout the entire film, ended up having his moment of glory in the end.
 

 
Yet, not a single Tong Zhao fan felt this was undeserved.
 

 
In fact, many thought this scene was even more touching than the previous solo performances of Tong Zhao and were glad that Tong Zhao's trust in him had not been misplaced.
 

 
The two of them relied on each other and fell into an exhausted sleep, waiting for the antidote to take effect.
 

 
There was no strength left to return to the first floor to deliver the antidote to Feng Sisi, who had hoped to lay low until the end.
 

 
And she never mustered the courage to come up and find them before the end of the show.
 

 
[It’s a relief!]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, can I say I cried watching this? It’s over. I’m a fan of Jie Zai’s girlfriend, but I support this marriage now. It’s so sweet. I also want to be the female warrior protecting Jie Zai!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, forever a god!]
 

 
At the end of the show, the actors opened their eyes simultaneously.
 

 
It felt like waking up from a long dream, still disoriented.
 

 
When Tong Zhao opened her eyes, Duan Ge was still in control of her primary persona. However, the memories of everyone in the drama had not yet returned, so no one knew how they performed or what had happened in the drama. As soon as Tong Zhao stepped out of the cabin, a blonde-haired, round-faced figure and Tang Jingjie rushed over, hugging her from both sides.
 

 
?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Duan Ge was a bit confused and habitually patted their heads, one hand on each: “Be good, be good.”
 

 
“Wuwuwu, I don’t even know why, I just really want to hug you…” Tang Jingjie, being a soft-hearted boy, couldn’t help but blurt out: “I’m doomed, my manager is definitely going to kill me. We won’t be rumored, right? Oh my God, what happened in the drama, I don’t want to let you go…”
 

 
“It’s normal to not want to let go, you should hold on!”
 

 
Anna, who had watched the second half of the drama due to leaving early, was also crying.
 

 
Everyone was quite moved, but Xu Zhu, who had been left aside, awkwardly looked towards the director's team. She guessed that Tong Zhao must have had a particularly tragic end because they were all so upset, and she gave Tong Zhao some comforting words:
 

 
“It’s normal for a post-apocalyptic survival film to be very challenging. It’s okay if you didn’t perform perfectly. Tong Zhao, don’t be too hard on yourself.”
# Chapter22
As soon as she finished speaking, Xu Zhu felt countless gazes turning toward her.
 

 
It was as if she had said something hilariously foolish.
 

 
She wasn’t unfamiliar with this kind of attention.
 

 
Before entering the holographic filming chamber, she had always been the focus of such looks, usually directed at her stepsister.
 

 
Was there a problem with the filming?
 

 
Xu Zhu grew anxious and quickly tried to make amends: “My memory hasn’t fully returned yet. If I said something wrong, I’m sorry. I still hope the filming went well!” She then flashed a compliant smile to everyone.
 

 
She was a bit smarter than her character Feng Sisi, knowing how to shift the narrative.
 

 
After all, they had returned to a peaceful world. Unless faced with life-or-death situations, people’s darker sides are hidden beneath their polished exteriors, and once the lights are on, everyone appears dignified.
 

 
“The filming was very successful. I believe the box office will reach an ideal number!” The director stepped in to smooth things over.
 

 
With the director’s words, the other staff members also gracefully shifted the topic.
 

 
Xu Zhu's intentions for bringing Tong Zhao into the group were not entirely pure, but that was only known to her.
 

 
In the eyes of the director and some core members, Xu Zhu was seen as the final piece of the puzzle for "Countdown 72 Hours," a key contributor to the funding and promotion!
 

 
If she spoke negatively about Tong Zhao here, what would that imply?
 

 
It would imply that she was being modest!
 

 
Before filming, she praised Tong Zhao excessively, boosting their confidence, and after filming, she did not seek credit for herself, truly a generous person.
 

 
Xu Zhu, feeling uneasy, joined the conversation. Due to her blank memory and uncertainty about the developments, she could only engage in conversation with Anna, the third female lead whom she had chatted with pleasantly before filming. However, Anna politely avoided her.
 

 
Since Anna's role was brief and she died early in the story, her in-film memory had already recovered.
 

 
How should one put it?
 

 
Although she knew it was all acting, being used as a scapegoat still wasn’t pleasant.
 

 
Hatred is too strong a word; being close friends is unnecessary.
 

 
If she had this time, why not get to know Miss Tong better?
 

 
Anna, in high spirits, went off to find her Eastern beauty.
 

 
Only the screenwriter walked over, patted Xu Zhu's shoulder, and gave a wry smile: “Xu Zhu, you really caused me a big trouble!”
 

 
His private messages and comments on Weibo had exploded.
 

 
The movie was good, but the key was that it had nothing to do with him; he was just a gatekeeper, with the highlights all coming from the actors themselves. The downside of instinctive films is that they test the editor's ability to create new worlds, and often, the outstanding performance is credited to the actors.
 

 
Especially actors like Tong Zhao, who have a very strong personal presence.
 

 
Oh well!
 

 
He could only think about the bonuses and fame that would come if the movie became a hit.
 

 
The screenwriter’s worried frown was partly genuine, while Xu Zhu, with a pleased expression, apologized to him on behalf of Tong Zhao.
 

 
The two of them comforted each other across channels; although they weren't talking about the same thing, they both had a mutual understanding and unspoken sentiments of regret and happiness.
 

 
After adding a long list of new contacts on WeChat, Tong Zhao was allowed to rest before attending the celebration banquet the next day. According to the stage crew, the unedited and raw footage had already been sent to their personal email, while the polished movie would be available for viewing rights online a week later.
 

 
She took a shower and was about to go to bed when the door was knocked.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit surprised, and even more so when she saw a golden head through the peephole.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Xiao Ge, are you awake?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m here.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Anna came; she’s probably here to find you.]
 

 
Duan Ge responded, and Tong Zhao then handed over the position of the main personality to her.
 

 
At their core, they were the same person and had never competed for the main role.
 

 
Staying in the memory palace to sleep was quite comfortable; as long as "she" was doing well, that was enough.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door to find Anna standing outside with a snow-white pillow, looking quite embarrassed.
 

 
"Is there something you need?" she asked gently.
 

 
"The feeling from the scene hasn’t faded. I keep feeling like zombies might break into my room at any moment. I'm scared alone and can’t sleep by myself..." Anna continued, "Could I sleep with you tonight? I can just sleep on the sofa."
 

 
The actors’ rooms on set were spacious, with a long sofa available for resting.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, "Come in. You can sleep with me."
 

 
Anna tiptoed inside and stole a glance at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Unlike her stylish short hair in the film, Tong Zhao outside of the scene had long, jet-black hair that looked like seaweed. She probably had just showered, as her hair was still damp. Her almond-shaped eyes, black and white under the light, had a poetic and picturesque quality unique to Eastern beauties. Anna stared, fascinated, and asked, "Can I help you dry your hair?"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze slightly, surprised.
 

 
Anna quickly added, "Consider it as a thank you for letting me stay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded with no objection.
 

 
After receiving permission, Anna happily went to get the hair dryer.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat down, and Anna placed her damp hair on her hands. As she dried it, she said enviously, “Your hair quality is really amazing. Do you have any special maintenance tips? I’ve heard that many Chinese actresses drink traditional Chinese medicine to stay looking so young.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pondered for a moment and replied, “Go to bed early, get up early, and exercise more to boost your metabolism.”
 

 
“That’s it?”
 

 
“That’s all.”
 

 
Anna marveled once again at Tong Zhao’s beauty, which seemed to have been kissed by the gods.
 

 
If the so-called "system" claiming to be the main deity can be considered a god, then this statement does hold some truth.
 

 
Once the hair was half-dried, Tong Zhao held Anna’s hand and said, “I plan to watch some of the rough cuts before bed. I’m going to start now; would you like to join me? If not, I’ll just use headphones and watch alone.”
 

 
Anna agreed happily, so the two young women sat side by side on the sofa, turned off the lights, and watched the rough cuts of their own performance.
 

 
In the neighboring room, separated by just a wall, Xu Zhu was doing the same thing.
 

 
The movie started, but Tong Zhao didn’t immediately switch to double speed. Instead, she stayed with Anna, watching the scene where she was dragged off as a substitute. Anna was still deeply affected by this scene, angrily hitting the pillow: “She’s so annoying, just a bitch. I really… I can’t face this face anymore! She only needed to avoid it! I didn’t do anything wrong, and I’m so useful!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Continue.”
 

 
Anna, with a confused look on her freckled face: “Huh?”
 

 
“If you can talk, say more.”
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, the scene switched to where Tong Zhao was pressing Xu Zhu’s head down onto a public restroom floor, making her bow.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t recall this memory at the moment, so she had to replay it repeatedly to savor it.
 

 
Anna, witnessing this personal grudge: “…”
 

 
After that scene passed, Tong Zhao switched to double speed to save time.
 

 
Anna was shocked and asked, “Do you hate her that much?”
 

 
“Not really. Don’t you think this part is quite satisfying?”
 

 
“You switched to double speed right after making her bow…”
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her lips slightly, the blue light from the TV screen casting a cold outline around her: “Don’t you have scenes coming up? Since you want to watch, I won’t fast-forward.”
 

 
With that, she became fully engrossed in the plot.
 

 
Anna, however, couldn’t focus on the screen anymore. Her heart was pounding as she watched Tong Zhao intently. Taking advantage of Tong Zhao’s concentration, she quietly moved closer and snuggled up to her. Tong Zhao didn’t mind at all. Noticing the added weight on her shoulder, she glanced at Anna, assuming the air conditioning was too low and that Anna was cold. She grabbed a thin blanket from beside her and draped it over Anna’s shoulders, pulling it closer around herself as well: “Still cold?”
 

 
……
 

 
The intimidating Eastern beauty knows how to flirt too well!
 

 
Apart from the part where she taught Xu Zhu a lesson, Tong Zhao mainly reviewed the crisis management aspects of the film, identifying many areas for improvement. In case of another apocalypse, she……
 

 
After finishing the sample footage, Duan Ge returned control of the body to Tong Zhao and also triggered two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s passive skill “Best in Show”: Physical fitness greatly enhanced, allowing the host to enjoy the physical strength developed by Duan Ge during the apocalyptic scenarios without any pain.]
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s active skill “Ultimate Moment”: The host can exceed human limits for ten minutes each day, performing theoretically impossible actions.]
 

 
Notably, the system also provided conditions for upgrading the skill.
 

 
For the Empress Shen-related skills, receiving a confession from an S-rank man grants one upgrade opportunity, while confessions from ranks below S (ABC) increase experience points accordingly. What surprised Tong Zhao was that a confession from an E-rank man actually decreases experience points.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Experience points can be deducted?]
 

 
Empress Shen: [It's reasonable. If a low-quality man has the courage to confess to me, it’s a disgrace. You must not have appeared noble or aloof enough; it’s time for reflection.]
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
A woman favored by the emperor indeed has the right to be so demanding.
 

 
In comparison, the conditions for upgrading Duan Ge’s skills are more reasonable and positive.
 

 
Saving a man grants half an upgrade opportunity.
 

 
For women, it grants a full upgrade.
 

 
Female Reporter: [Duan Ge’s true nature confirmed.]
 

 
[It’s not me, I didn’t do it,] Duan Ge denied, scratching her face. [I just care more for women. If women don’t pity women, should we wait for men to save us?]
 

 
Lu Xianchang silently gave a thumbs up.
 

 
Given this trend, Tong Zhao really feared that one day after acting in a fantasy drama, Lu Xianchang’s skill upgrade condition might be to personally eliminate scumbag men—killing one would grant a level-up. But that’s a long way off, so she tried not to think too much about it.
 

 
After the movie ended, Anna was once again moved to tears by the ending.
 

 
Tong Zhao handed her a tissue and acted as a comforting, secure pillow all night until the golden-haired round-face fell asleep in her arms.
 

 
They slept soundly, but someone in the neighboring room couldn’t sleep.
 

 
After watching the sample, Xu Zhu finally understood why the other staff members looked at her oddly.
 

 
It turned out, it wasn’t because Tong Zhao had ruined the performance…
 

 
On the contrary, she had performed exceptionally well.
 

 
It was Xu Zhu who had messed up!
 

 
Xu Zhu twisted her fingers until they were white, too afraid to check Weibo on her phone.
 

 
Her mind was filled with images of Feng Sisi from the movie—
 

 
How could she be like this?
 

 
Recognizing oneself is an eternal challenge in life. Those often called brave might flee when faced with true danger, while the most ordinary and unremarkable individuals might sacrifice themselves to save others during an earthquake... Xu Zhu knew she wasn't particularly kind, but she never imagined she could be so outrageous.
 

 
What puzzled Xu Zhu even more was how she might have messed up, but how could Tong Zhao perform so well?
 

 
Wasn’t she just someone who flattered men?
 

 
It was all Tong Zhao’s fault. If Tong Zhao hadn’t performed so well, Xu Zhu wouldn’t have looked so selfish and conspicuous.
 

 
While Xu Zhu was anxious and confused, a message from a special contact on WeChat arrived:
 

 
Dad: [How was your performance in the first film?]
 

 
Dad: [I have high hopes for you. In my heart, you're actually better than Tong Zhao. Don’t let me down.]
 

 
She had longed for such words for many years.
 

 
At that moment, her heart rate suddenly quickened, and she felt her hands and feet turn cold with panic.
# Chapter23
The bright phone screen hurt Xu Zhu's eyes.
 

 
But she couldn't ignore her father's message, so she hesitantly replied: [It was okay.]
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhenming replied with a voice message.
 

 
“What do you mean by ‘okay’? You are now the rightful young lady of the Tong family, my daughter, and you need to be confident. I don't like the way you speak; you need to change that. Don’t embarrass me and make me regret choosing you.”
 

 
Judging by the slightly tipsy tone, it seemed he had remembered to ask after leaving a drinking session.
 

 
In the dimly lit room, Xu Zhu clutched her phone tightly, her face showing a look of defeat.
 

 
She wanted her father to comfort her…
 

 
Clearly, she had hinted at her unhappiness and was nearly choking up, but what her father cared about was something else—
 

 
He didn’t like her tone and was concerned about her causing him embarrassment.
 

 
If we’re talking about confidence, Tong Zhao certainly had plenty of it.
 

 
Whether at school or at home, even if her father abandoned her, Tong Zhao always appeared as if she were the chosen one, calm and graceful, exuding an air of elegance.
 

 
Xu Zhu, infuriated, threw her phone onto the bed and took out a Polaroid photo from her wallet.
 

 
It was a photo of her and Tong Zhao together.
 

 
Xu Zhu traced over Tong Zhao's face with her glittering nails in the photo, leaving scratches on that impeccably beautiful face. This action somewhat cooled her anger—envy is truly the most burning emotion, and she resented Tong Zhao so much. Tong Zhenming was also a despicable man—didn't she want to have that kind of long-term, ingrained confidence? Why didn’t she? Just because she grew up alongside the Tong family's daughter!?
 

 
If only Tong Zhenming had married her mother back then.
 

 
Why didn’t her mother act sooner?
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched and flattened the photo, feeling heartbroken and on the verge of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao was her obsession.
 

 
Only by defeating her and proving she was better could Xu Zhu hope to resolve this knot.
 

 
---
 

 
After filming *Countdown 72 Hours*, Xu Zhu had to return to shoot the second half of *Star Selection Girls*.
 

 
The girls in the group all knew that Xu Zhu had connections. Except for a few contestants with backgrounds who had some conflicts with her, the other contestants were all polite. The director even arranged a short-haired roommate for Xu Zhu, who was kind and willing to play a supporting role.
 

 
Before Xu Zhu left, she was full of confidence.
 

 
Everyone knew she had film resources even before officially debuting.
 

 
However, upon returning, Xu Zhu was very low-key. Only when her roommate came back from dance practice and found an extra person in the room did she excitedly ask, "Xu Zhu, you finished filming the movie? When can we see it? I will definitely buy a ticket to support you."
 

 
"Yes, it's done," Xu Zhu replied.
 

 
Mentioning the movie made Xu Zhu's eyes redden a bit. "Don't watch it. It feels strange for people I know to see me in a movie."
 

 
She really wished the film would never be released.
 

 
It would be best if it failed to pass review and stayed forever in the vault.
 

 
The short-haired roommate thought Xu Zhu was just being shy and laughed, "I'll buy twenty tickets and invite the whole group to watch. By the way, the team-building event hasn't been decided yet. How about we go to watch your movie together? It sounds like a great idea and would show our team spirit."
 

 
Xu Zhu: "…”
 

 
She knew her roommate was just flattering her.
 

 
After all, this roommate didn’t have any connections, had average popularity, and her only persona was "Xu Zhu's little princess's maid and close friend." She had attracted some fans who liked Yuri through the cute "sisterly" angle, barely surviving each voting period, and was definitely trying to curry favor with Xu Zhu.
 

 
It was awful.
 

 
Xu Zhu couldn’t imagine how the top contestants, who usually didn’t get along with her, would react when they discovered she had messed up the movie. They would likely make a big deal out of it and criticize her.
 

 
According to Murphy’s Law, "the more you fear something, the more likely it is to happen," as soon as Xu Zhu dropped her luggage in the dorm, Gu Yanzhi, who had been in second place in the last voting, pushed open their slightly ajar door. Even before showing her face, her voice was already heard, "Xu Zhu, your sacrifice for this movie is too great!"
 

 
"What sacrifice?"
 

 
Her roommate looked confused.
 

 
Gu Yanzhi grinned and waved her phone, which was playing a scene of Xu Zhu bowing repeatedly, her forehead reddened and eyes full of tears.
 

 
【"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."】
 

 
This short video even had sound, and Gu Yanzhi was laughing so hard she almost cracked.
 

 
It was so satisfying, a really good movie, even better than some indie films.
 

 
Xu Zhu, relying on her wealthy father and connections with the production team, had been flaunting her little princess act. Gu Yanzhi had long been annoyed by her. With both having similar backgrounds and fan popularity, when it was revealed that Xu Zhu landed this movie opportunity, everyone thought Xu Zhu would definitely overshadow her upon returning.
 

 
Who would have thought?
 

 
The little princess was now bowing down.
 

 
Xu Zhu glared at the phone Gu Yanzhi was waving, her face dark with anger, almost wanting to leap forward and tear her face apart.
 

 
But realizing that a physical altercation would not benefit anyone, Xu Zhu chose to hold back, ending this small dispute with her suppressed anger.
 

 
In the instinctive movie, she would explode and turn things around.
 

 
In reality, after weighing the pros and cons, she decided to remember this incident and settle scores with Gu Yanzhi and Tong Zhao later.
 

 
Because of this, Xu Zhu’s performance in the filming of the program significantly declined.
 

 
She couldn’t focus at all.
 

 
Moreover, *Countdown 72 Hours* was broadcast live. Although most viewers chose to wait for reviews and the final cut before watching, evaluations of the film had already leaked, along with some edited short videos:
 

 
The top three most popular clips were:
 

 
1. Feng Sisi drags Anna in to be a scapegoat, then apologizes while being forced to bow her head.
 
2. Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove a bullet from her eyebrow.
 
3. In the final scene, Song Kaiyu, having obtained the crucial antidote, feeds it to his girlfriend and then they fall asleep shoulder to shoulder.
 

 
Except for the third clip, which was marketed by Sister and Tang Jingjie’s companies, the first two clips spread virally on their own, hitting all the high points for netizens—beautiful, powerful, and tragic. The ugly scars left by the bullets on her white thighs were visually striking. Traditionally, such "cutting the bones to remove poison" scenes were privileges reserved for male actors, showcasing their tough-guy image.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was determined to make her mark in the male-dominated field.
 

 
When *Countdown 72 Hours* aired, the character that drew the most attention was the female lead.
 

 
Tong Zhao had such a strong presence that even fans of the male lead had to bow down.
 

 
#FengSisiDoesNotDeserveIt#
 

 
#TouchingChineseSisterFengYanqi#
 

 
#BowDownToTheSister#
 

 
The male lead was originally quite unworthy.
 

 
However, in the end, overcoming his fears fighting alongside the female lead, and saying lines like, "Then let’s die together," which female viewers love, turned around the audience's favor in the final ten minutes. Fans of the mom were comforted and commented: [Jie’s grown up / heart/heart]
 

 
A passerby commented: [Why not call him Jiebao?]
 

 
And this comment received likes well into the next year.
 

 
Tong Zhao's new fans were eager for her work. Unlike the first batch of fans who got into the fandom, they could also explore *The Legend of Emperor Ming*...
 

 
However, they were stunned to see that the role of the ultra-cool "Yanqi" in the first episode of her new work was actually set in a palace intrigue theme.
 

 
How can she do palace intrigue?
 

 
A physics major excelling in palace intrigue?
 

 
It’s truly unfathomable.
 

 
But the numbers are objective. The episodes of *The Legend of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao saw a small spike in sales, and the Empress's dance received renewed attention, especially when combined with Duan Ge’s action scenes…
 

 
You don’t even need to watch the movie; just seeing those three clips and GIFs is enough to understand that the meme has truly gone viral.
 

 
Moreover, these memes have attracted a large number of people to purchase viewing rights. Zombie action movies haven’t been a popular genre in recent years, but due to the crowd mentality, many people watched *Countdown 72 Hours* to avoid missing out, to have something to discuss with friends, and to show off their knowledge on Weibo and Moments, creating a positive cycle of admiration among peers.
 

 
Since the film is available online, with strict copyright control, it effectively curtails the possibility of piracy and avoids the "screening tyranny" of cinemas, which forces viewers to watch poorly reviewed movies due to overbooked schedules. With just a helmet on or lying in a cabin, you can watch any movie you want without interference, even if the cinema's big shots come.
 

 
In this environment, the quality of the film and the effectiveness of its promotion are greatly enhanced.
 

 
Good wine isn’t afraid of deep alleys, but if the aroma is strong enough, even a film that’s just passable can make a decent profit.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* has both of these qualities.
 

 
It’s genuinely exciting and visually appealing, and it has become a hit because of various interesting memes.
 

 
It emerged suddenly, and no film could compete with it.
 

 
Tong Zhao's Weibo follower count skyrocketed, and the number of invitations sent to her agent, Chu Jie, multiplied several times. If the industry had merely extended olive branches to her after she finished *The Legend of Ming Emperor*, after *72 Hours*, she would have been in high demand for variety shows, interviews, and endorsements—everyone was eager for her.
 

 
It can be said that now, as long as she agrees, there are no resources Tong Zhao can't get, except for the top-tier celebrities!
 

 
"Interviews are a given, and now you can finally choose some high-end ads. It was right to turn down that spicy noodle ad before. Now there are offers for watches and perfumes," Chu Jie said happily. "There's also a supplement cover for *YQ*. Although it’s just a supplement, it’s still *YQ*. I've marked it in your schedule; you need to keep those times open."
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded.
 

 
Chu Jie looked up at her: “Are you doing yoga?”
 

 
Tong Zhao answered seriously, “I’m doing yoga while absorbing the essence of the sun and moon.”
 

 
With her foundational training solidified, she no longer needed to sit cross-legged; she could now practice advanced poses, effectively multitasking and achieving more with less effort. However, Chu Jie clearly didn’t quite understand and looked at her with a puzzled expression before continuing, “Then there are variety shows… two guest appearances, one long-term.”
 

 
The variety show invitations were all aimed at her, with both guest appearances related to survival themes.
 

 
One is about surviving on a desert island, and the other is about farming in the countryside.
 

 
The long-term one is interesting—it’s a romance variety show.
 

 
As soon as Empress Chen saw this topic, she couldn't sit still: "Let me have a go; I want to raise fish!"
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately crossed out the farming option. She had never done farming during her quick transmigrations and saw no need to challenge herself in an area she wasn't skilled in. However, the desert island survival show was worth considering.
 

 
As for the romance variety show?
 

 
She glanced at the title: *Beware of the Sea King: Attack with Heart*.
 

 
This peculiar title sounded somewhat familiar; it seemed to have been popular in her previous life.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, “Interesting, let’s go with that one.”
# Chapter24
“Romance variety show?”
 

 
After hearing Tong Zhao's decision, Sister Chu gave her a subtle look, one that seemed to say—
 

 
"Are you trying to pull another stunt?"
 

 
She had the same expression when Tong Zhao wanted to take on a big female lead role in a zombie action film.
 

 
At that time, she had stopped her, but considering the box office success of *Countdown 72 Hours*, her advice lingered on her lips. Instead of directly dissuading her, she said, “The show you’ve chosen is in holographic format, which is similar to shooting a reality film. It will reveal your most authentic side.”
 

 
With current technology, holographic filming can only be done this way.
 

 
Audiences seem to love it.
 

 
It makes sense; people want to see the real side of glamorous stars, and even for ordinary people with no fame, exposing their true nature can be intriguing—whether it’s a seemingly innocent student engaging in shady online activities, a well-educated white-collar worker secretly mistreating stray cats, or a wealthy young man showing his lonely and kind side…
 

 
Whether good or bad, it’s all about satisfying voyeuristic desires.
 

 
The criminal code outlines ways to make big money.
 

 
And industries that cater to human vices often make a substantial profit.
 

 
“Although traditional variety shows have fewer viewers, they are stable and can help establish your existing persona,” Sister Chu said.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
She was confident this variety show would be a hit. Since she had been invited, she didn't want to miss out.
 

 
Perhaps it was a habit from her experiences in the quick-wear world of completing tasks and missions, Tong Zhao found it hard to relax. She was always purposeful, and if she stopped for a moment, she began to feel anxious, eager to keep working. High productivity was a source of her security; not advancing meant falling behind, and she wouldn’t let an opportunity slip by.
 

 
However, she needed a good reason to reassure her manager.
 

 
“I also want to experience a sweet, innocent romance in a variety show.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
As she spoke, her aura seemed to radiate an otherworldly charm, as if every word she said was profound wisdom.
 

 
“Are you sure?”
 

 
Sister Chu gave her a sidelong glance and flipped over the proposal for the romance variety show to show her the content summary.
 

 
“Beware of the Heartbreaker: Conquering the Heart”
 

 
“Six single men and women will live under the same roof. They will forget their real-life identities and receive a new identity card, along with different tasks, and must find a way to earn living expenses. Each person has one opportunity to confess their feelings. Will you find true love, or will you be just another fish in someone else's pond? Be careful, as there are two heartbreakers among the six, with impure motives aiming to set your heart on fire.”
 

 
...
 

 
Sweet, innocent romance.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit pained, but she was certain Empress Shen would love this concept.
 

 
Without missing a beat, she said, “I’m sure. It’s perfect for me as if it was tailor-made for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was confident. Even if she didn't draw the heartbreaker card, she had the ability to make any heartbreaker release all the fish in their pond and love only her. After all, how could a mere heartbreaker compare to an emperor with three thousand beauties? An emperor doesn’t just have a pond but the entire Pacific Ocean and he alone favors her, a beautiful mermaid.
 

 
Sister Chu studied her for a moment, then nodded without further discussion. “Alright, I’ll clear your schedule.”
 

 
She made a few notes on the calendar. “You’ll need to film a promotional video before entering the cabin, and the identity cards will be drawn before filming starts.”
 

 
That was good.
 

 
If a more suitable personality emerged, it could be swapped in advance.
 

 
“Is there a script?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
“Reality variety shows only have guiding plots, not the kind of script you’re imagining for traditional variety shows.”
 

 
“Oh, and at the beginning of next month, you and a few other leads from ‘72 Hours’ need to appear on a show for promotion. You’ll need to keep that day free…”
 

 
“How long will ‘Survivor Island’ take to film? If it’s less than three days, I’d like to join,” she said, recalling what Duan Ge mentioned.
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
After some back-and-forth, Tong Zhao’s electronic calendar was filled to the brim with appointments.
 

 
*
 

 
After finishing ‘72 Hours,’ Tong Zhao enjoyed a valuable week off.
 

 
She had slept all day in the apartment, spent the entire next day dealing with personal matters at her computer, and was woken up on the third day by the doorbell.
 

 
Expecting it to be some kind of sales visit, she peered through the peephole and saw a familiar brown-dyed head—the long-lost Wei Dasha.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door, a bit surprised. “A rare visitor.”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t come empty-handed; he carried two large bags full of items and, without hesitation, took off his shoes and walked in. The bags were filled with daily necessities, and soon enough, he had packed her refrigerator and bathroom cabinet. Tong Zhao was even more surprised. “So, you’ve finally decided to give up on inheriting the family business to become a civil servant, and you’re practicing precise poverty alleviation at my place?”
 

 
“Poverty alleviation my foot, I’m just worried you might starve at home.”
 

 
Wei Zekai had seen her perform on stage with Xu Zhu and, concerned that she might be feeling down, found an excuse to check on her.
 

 
Seeing that she was doing well, he felt relieved and started paying attention to some trivial matters. “By the way, can you perform that thing again?”
 

 
“What thing?”
 

 
“You know,” Wei Zekai gestured on his thigh, “the one with the bullet.”
 

 
Tong Zhao forced a smile. "I could use your head to demonstrate bowing."
 

 
"Ugh."
 

 
Although he knew it was impossible, Wei Zekai still sighed deeply with regret.
 

 
Tong Zhao rummaged through the snacks he hadn’t put in the refrigerator and found three large packs of premium cigarettes, clearly expensive. She was speechless. "Why did you buy me cigarettes? When have you ever seen me smoke?"
 

 
"You smoked in the movie."
 

 
Wei Zekai gave her a sidelong glance.
 

 
The rebellious young man’s usually cool and arrogant face was now full of melancholy.
 

 
Tong Zhao, even if slow on the uptake, understood. She slammed the table. "Do you really like the character Feng Yanqi I played?"
 

 
Wei Zekai extended his face. "It’s somewhat interesting."
 

 
"So you do like it."
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, unpacked the cigarettes and lighter he gave her, and, like in the movie, flicked the lighter with a flourish before lighting the cigarette. She held it between her fingers and gave him a smile that was very much in the style of "Duan Ge," making this arrogant young master freeze in place. Before he could react, she extinguished the cigarette. "How’s that? I’ve even done a special performance just for you.”
 

 
... So cool!
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure. "It is somewhat interesting."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled, then remembered something important.
 

 
"Wen Kai and the others mentioned wanting to invest in the film industry before, right? It definitely has potential, but I think their vision is still a bit narrow. Relying solely on your pocket money and my current salary won’t be enough."
 

 
The film industry is an expensive endeavor, and even the Tong family might struggle with it.
 

 
The Wei family, however, could handle it.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reputation was a concern. As far as Tong Zhao knew, his most profitable investments were those where he did nothing at all. During periods when he followed motivational posts on WeChat and Zhihu about starting businesses, he ended up losing a lot of money.
 

 
This led his well-meaning friends to secretly feed him the toxic message, "Effort doesn’t guarantee success, but not trying is definitely comfortable," to prevent him from wasting more money.
 

 
The Wei family no longer dared to let him play around and planned to find someone else to manage the group in the future, turning Wei Zekai into a figurehead. They hoped he would quickly settle down, start a family, and have a grandchild with some investment sense, or even a granddaughter would do.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai had already given up on starting a business, his legendary status still persisted in the world.
 

 
A legendary status earned for nothing.
 

 
But Tong Zhao remembered that, in her previous life, Wei Zekai had initially failed many times before learning from his mistakes and improving.
 

 
But now, no one believes he can succeed.
 

 
"I'll find a way to get some money from home," Wei Zekai pondered, causing his family’s elder to have a headache. "Should I go back and tell them I'll castrate myself if they don’t give me a billion?"
 

 
"If you say anything more, I might not be able to stop myself from stepping in," Tong Zhao shot him a look. "I want to pool the money and give you some investment advice, as long as you trust my judgment."
 

 
Firstly, she has a few years' worth of advanced knowledge about which companies and stocks will rise.
 

 
Secondly, her experiences in the modern world of quick-wear have also given her some insights into investing.
 

 
What she lacks is the capital.
 

 
She also wants to create a business circle where she holds the leading position, a circle that Xu Zhu and the Tong family have no right to touch.
 

 
Not only does she want to act, but she also wants to surpass Tong Zhenming in his most proud field.
 

 
"Actually, even if you hadn’t come to me, I was planning to invite you out to discuss something serious," Tong Zhao said, walking over to the top of the cluttered cabinet with her long legs. She placed a document, which had been weighed down by a mooncake tin, in front of Wei Zekai. The faint smell of smoke still lingered in the air, adding a touch of business atmosphere to the otherwise casual setting. As Wei Zekai looked at her, he almost saw through her and glimpsed the highly confident female lead from *Countdown 72 Hours*.
 

 
“Duan Ge” is just one of Tong Zhao's personas in the world; she is still herself.
 

 
"Here are seven investment opportunities I’m very optimistic about. You can review the details. They’ll use up more than a year's worth of your pocket money, including my acting fees. You can take them back to consult a lawyer and see if there’s anyone else who wants to join us."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused and gave him a teasing smile:
 

 
"Mr. Wei, are you willing to go bankrupt with me again?"
 

 
Her young and beautiful face radiated with vibrant ambition, burning into Wei Zekai's retina.
 

 
After understanding her words, Wei Zekai's heart raced.
 

 
He was moved.
 

 
Not in a romantic sense.
 

 
Why do rich second-generation heirs repeatedly fall for investment and entrepreneurship scams? It’s clear they could easily live a comfortable life just by collecting dividends and rent. The desire to prove oneself in youth often outweighs everything else. Everyone thinks Wei Zekai lacks the ability to start a business and the vision for investment…
 

 
But Tong Zhao was telling him to try again.
 

 
"Alright, I’ll go back and take a look,”
 

 
Wei Zekai made an effort to keep his voice calm, but he was insistent: "From now on, as long as you have a film you're working on, my family will invest in it."
 

 
He was eager to support his good friend in this way.
 

 
He wanted to tie his investment directly to the films she made.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded without hesitation and smiled at him again.
 

 
The news about Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao working together spread quickly among the second-generation circles. Those who were friendly with Wei Zekai found it amusing and interesting, so without much hesitation, they joined the investment venture, forming an investment interest group. An unnamed friend even humorously renamed the group to:
 

 
【Mr. Wei’s Charity Foundation】
 

 
No one had much faith in this venture set up by the second-generation heirs playing around.
 

 
The most skeptical was Ning Zhiyi, who had just started dealing with the business in his own company.
 

 
He thought Tong Zhao must be crazy to be interested in Wei Zekai. Others also couldn’t understand why they would get involved, so he advised the more diligent and well-behaved second-generation heirs to stay away from this group that seemed like throwing money into the sea. His advice had some effect, as many cautious second-generation heirs turned down Wei Zekai’s invitation.
# Chapter25
Ning Zhiyi didn't feel at all that he was cutting off someone's financial path.
 

 
He thought he was actually doing a good deed, accumulating merit.
 

 
And it was for Tong Zhao's benefit.
 

 
If Tong Zhao collaborated with Wei Zekai and a bunch of second-generation heirs lost money, even if they had agreed in advance that the investment could result in a loss, how could they not hold a grudge against her? He didn’t want to see her offend so many people. Not only did he advise others not to invest, but he also called Tong Zhao to persuade her to reconsider.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi cautiously asked, “Are you really going to invest with Wei Zekai?”
 

 
“Yes, is there a problem?”
 

 
Tong Zhao responded coldly.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi frowned and tried to give good advice, saying many heartfelt words. As the conversation went on, he drifted further: “You’re a girl, you shouldn’t mix with Wei Zekai and his crowd. I heard you even invested your own film earnings? They’re all only children in their families; no matter how they waste money, there’s always someone to cover it. Now that Uncle Tong is old and has a child, and you’ve fallen out with him, you need to think about your own future…”
 

 
“I’m investing for my own benefit,” Tong Zhao interrupted him. “I know you’re advising people you know not to invest.”
 

 
Caught off guard by her directness, Ning Zhiyi awkwardly fell silent for three seconds. “I’m just worried about you.”
 

 
“Worried about me? That’s a bit amusing. But I don’t mind your little maneuvers behind my back. I’m not planning to bring too many people into this. I just want to let you know that since you’ve chosen your side, there’s no need to contact me again. I’m not interested in being friends with Xu Zhu’s boyfriend.”
 

 
In a flash, Ning Zhiyi thought he had grasped the issue.
 

 
He softened his tone, “Are you jealous of Xu Zhu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily at a loss for words.
 

 
Duan Ge was quite displeased: “I’d rather eat raw than be jealous of Xu Zhu. What a joke.”
 

 
Empress Chen: “Help, does he think Zhao Zhao likes him? I’m offended; it’s disgusting.”
 

 
She pulled at the corners of her mouth, remaining calm. She smiled and said, “Why is it that you’re so confident when you’re even less appealing than Wei Zekai? Goodbye, don’t bother me again.”
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao ended the call.
 

 
When Ning Zhiyi tried calling again, the line was already disconnected.
 

 
“What do you mean that even Wei Zekai is better?”
 

 
Wei Zekai himself felt somewhat offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned off the speakerphone and looked at the group of friends gathered in her apartment. Five young men and women had crowded the already small room to the point where there was barely space to move. These pampered young masters and mistresses didn’t seem to care at all. They brought their own drinks and junk food, and were huddled together munching on McDonald's.
 

 
When she turned back, she saw Wei Zekai with a whole chicken wing hanging from his mouth.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite good-looking, but his nutritional supply seemed uneven. He must have lacked a crucial bit of brain function, as there was a glob of ketchup smeared on his straight nose, though it was unclear how it got there—truly a unique character.
 

 
This was the final small group willing to invest and make money with Wei Zekai and her.
 

 
The group consisted of only seven people in total, with clear roles of president and vice president.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the president, and everyone gave him the nickname "Philanthropic Gambler.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was the vice president, not because the others thought she was inferior to Wei Zekai, but because she was responsible for stopping the president from turning investment into charity.
 

 
The second-generation rich were not merely ignorant. They had received high-quality education and understood business and investment knowledge better than children from ordinary families. They could deduce why a business would succeed based on results, but when it came to starting a business from scratch and making money...
 

 
They were at a loss.
 

 
Originally, everyone thought this was just a new kind of social gathering for eating, drinking, and spending money, with the chance to get to know the hot and popular Tong Zhao and take some pictures to show off on social media. However, after sitting down and listening to Tong Zhao’s series of personal speeches...
 

 
They realized how knowledgeable Tong Zhao was.
 

 
The more they listened, the more they realized.
 

 
It seemed like it really had potential!
 

 
In the past, Tong Zhao had managed to gather a group of followers during the apocalypse. Now, in peacetime, persuading others to make money with her was not difficult, especially when dealing with pampered young masters and mistresses who had never experienced significant hardships.
 

 
By the end of the afternoon, they were convinced that listening to Tong Zhao would eventually lead to big profits.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she weren’t acting, she might have become a successful pyramid scheme leader and made a fortune.
 

 
“Ning Zhiyi thinks I like him,” Tong Zhao said casually.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Ning Zhiyi really has too high an opinion of himself. I can’t wait to see his reaction when he finds out we’ve made money.”
 

 
Second-Generation B handed Wei Zekai a tissue to wipe the ketchup from his nose: “Don’t even mention it. My brother was on good terms with him. I had persuaded my brother to join, but after Ning Zhiyi talked him out of it, he stood me up today. It’s so annoying.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the shabby room, a group of not-so-promising young rakes had gathered.
 

 
The high-quality cigarettes that Wei Zekai had bought for Tong Zhao were also divided among them.
 

 
To be honest, Tong Zhao thought they were a bunch of simpletons.
 

 
But what did it matter if they were simpletons? Just like in many stories where the protagonist enjoys being favored by a group, the most important thing in life is to be on the right team.
 

 
And the biggest advantage of these simpletons was that they had chosen her.
 

 
Simpleton C: “Strategist, I want to take a photo with you!”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her chin: “Alright, come over.”
 

 
*
 

 
After finalizing the investment plans, Tong Zhao went to participate in the promotional program for “Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
Since it was Duan Ge's performance, she also took charge of this interview, gladly taking a break.
 

 
The interview included some common mini-games, and the content of the games was directly taken from the film. Tong Zhao sat in the makeup room, having her makeup touched up by the artist while flipping through the script, worried that the director might ask her to perform a demonstration of her marksmanship.
 

 
In the end, the program team asked her to perform some shooting skills on stage.
 

 
They used a temporary shooting range, originally intended to show the audience the difference between reality and holographic filming, emphasizing that being a cool sharpshooter isn't as easy as it seems. However...
 

 
Holding a real gun similar to the one used in the film, Tong Zhao wore safety goggles and earmuffs.
 

 
She was dressed in a bright red cocktail dress with high heels, a stark contrast to her more neutral, professional attire in the film. Yet, after pulling the trigger and achieving a score of 200 hits from 20 shots, no one could see her as just a pretty face.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Despite her beautiful appearance, she was remarkably formidable.
 

 
Duan Ge: [Is this all you wanted me to do?]
 

 
Duan Ge curled her lips with a hint of disdain.
 

 
That smug, over-the-top smile was captured in a close-up by the production team, adding an extra layer of shine to her fierce persona.
 

 
Anna and Tang Jingjie clapped excitedly, letting the audience know that the lead actor had good chemistry.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu stared blankly at her step-sister.
 

 
There was no venomous jealousy to prompt netizens to write more negative commentary. However, her dazed and out-of-sorts appearance meant she couldn’t grab any camera time or opportunities to shine. All the spotlight went to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When did the step-sister learn to shoot?
 

 
Xu Zhu was a bit unsettled.
 

 
But it wasn’t surprising; wealthy children often learn a wide range of things—piano, flower arranging, skiing, extreme sports. There are plenty of extravagant ways to spend money.
 

 
During the interview, Tong Zhao was specifically asked a few questions that netizens were curious about.
 

 
“Your two characters are quite different, but since it’s a primal instinct film, which one do you think is closer to the real you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Feng Yanqi. I am very ambitious; the Empress often has to act against her will.”
 

 
Against her will.
 

 
Seeing this interview, Ming Emperor Song Wanzhuo felt as if he had experienced heartbreak all over again.
 

 
When the topic of "acting against one's will" came up, her tone suddenly softened, likely due to thoughts of the Empress.
 

 
The male host grinned mischievously and said, “So, among the ‘Zhao Jie CP’ with Tang Jingjie, it seems the female lead’s name is ranked first this year. I heard this is... implying the dominant role, right?”
 

 
The female host nodded knowingly.
 

 
Tang Jingjie’s face flushed red.
 

 
“It’s normal,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, not at all shy about the scandal, turned to smile at Tang Jingjie and reached out to drape her arm over his shoulder. “When I stand next to him, the roles of dominant and submissive are quite clear, right?”
 

 
As soon as the answer was given, the studio erupted in laughter without needing any cues from the stage crew.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, covering his face in resignation, said, “I wish I were half as handsome as Sister Zhao.”
 

 
The host responded, “It’s okay, the fans just love your cuteness.”
 

 
Tong Zhao and Tang Jingjie’s CP was essentially a pairing that happened halfway through, without much fanfare.
 

 
The buzz around Ming Emperor X Empress is far behind.
 

 
It’s clear that the dominant-male, submissive-female dynamic is mainstream.
 

 
However, this does not affect Tong Zhao's fan base.
 

 
On the contrary, most of her followers are career-oriented fans who do not want her to be involved in romance or interact with male celebrities. They prefer her to remain independent and exclusive.
 

 
After this episode aired, the video of Tong Zhao using a real gun again topped the trending searches.
 

 
Before it even fell off the trending list, she moved on to filming the promotional video for *Be Careful, Sea King*, where she met the five people who would live with her in the holographic world for a month.
 

 
Reality shows in this format emphasize authenticity, so not all participants are celebrities.
 

 
Many are influencers or just ordinary people.
 

 
The only common trait they share is that they all look quite good.
 

 
However...
 

 
After greeting the director, Tong Zhao walked over to a man with dyed golden-brown hair and tapped Male Contestant Number One on the shoulder:
 

 
“Charity Gambling King, explain why you are here.”
 

 
“Call me Mingzun,”
 

 
Today, Young Master Wei was wearing a shorter black shirt, and when he lifted his arm, the tattoo on his abs was visible, making Tong Zhao think he might need an extra layer; “Didn’t I say? I invest in any show you’re involved in. The director thought I had a talent for acting and invited me to join. Everything’s all set, and I’m free!”
 

 
He seemed quite excited: “Let me tell you, this show is the first time our Mingzun and Anzun are collaborating, and we absolutely can’t mess it up.”
 

 
From Wei Zekai’s brief explanation, strategist Tong Zhao had already deduced the truth.
 

 
The director must have seen Wei Zekai’s good looks and wealthy background, figuring he’d be a great addition to the show and persuaded him to join.
 

 
“Wei Zekai,”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him thoughtfully: “Do you know this isn’t a movie shoot? You’re here to find romance.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...What?”
# Chapter26
Tong Zhao spent five minutes explaining what a dating reality show is.
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned.
 

 
He pointed to himself and asked, "Is it real dating? Not acting?"
 

 
Well, it's not really real dating.
 

 
The scheming of people's hearts in a reality show is different from reality. However, quite a few who pair up on the show end up seeing each other as soulmates afterward because they've seen the truest side of each other's souls. "This show has a storyline and background setting. In a bit, we'll draw identity cards. Who knows, you might go from being a rich second-generation heir to a pauper."
 

 
"It doesn't matter."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed quite confident.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought it made sense, after all, he was a handsome guy, and there were always a lot of girls who liked him back in school.
 

 
But it turned out his confidence came from something else: "I am spiritually rich, and I have personal charisma."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him but didn't see any sign of spiritual richness.
 

 
Just as she was about to ruffle his golden-brown hair, she saw a man with a strong, chiseled face, dressed in a casual suit, walking over and greeting the two of them, "Hello, I am Contestant No. 2, He Shun." He pointed to the small square name tag on his chest and smiled at Tong Zhao. "I’m your fan. May I shake your hand?"
 

 
Tong Zhao politely shook his hand.
 

 
Although he claimed to be her fan, He Shun remained very restrained and didn't take advantage of the situation. Maybe it was because the cameras were rolling. "I’m the boss of Feiteng Capital, so you could say I'm a somewhat well-known investor. But recently, my sharpest investment was still on the first episode of 'The Legend of Emperor Ming' when you appeared. Really, I knew you had potential from the very first episode."
 

 
He looked down at Tong Zhao, his eyes burning with intensity.
 

 
It was the kind of gaze a man has when he sees someone he is attracted to.
 

 
Off to the side, Wei Zekai’s internal alarm bells went off, and he quickly cut in to introduce himself: "My surname is Wei, Wei Zekai. I mainly focus on charity... no, I mean, investment as well. I’ve been investing in Tong Zhao since a long time ago. Back in elementary school, when she played the lead role in a play, I cast my vote for her as the Best Young Actress."
 

 
Tong Zhao was his only successful project to date.
 

 
The more popular Tong Zhao became, the more it proved that Wei Zekai had a good eye for investments.
 

 
Damn old man, he also wants to compete with him for the position of the first investor!
 

 
"......"
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit too embarrassed to watch.
 

 
Just then, the host called for everyone to gather and draw cards, so the three of them stopped talking and headed to the center of the room.
 

 
The walls of this room were painted pink, with red balloons and ribbons everywhere. The lighting created a shimmering visual effect, making the setup look like a proposal scene.
 

 
"Let me reintroduce our show."
 

 
"The official name is *Beware of the Sea King*, but it can also be called *Sea King Killer*."
 

 
In front of the host was a box, with a stack of demonstration cards next to it.
 

 
He held up a card featuring a person in black clothing wearing a dog mask: “This is the Judge. While enjoying the process of dating, whoever draws this card has the responsibility to identify the 'Sea King' hiding among you and expose the true nature of the players who are insincere in love! The Judge has a mysterious special ability, which only the player who draws this card will know about. For now, let’s keep it a secret.”
 

 
[Judge]
 

 
The second and third cards the host raised happened to be a pair of elegantly dressed man and woman standing back to back.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
"For the players who draw the Sea King card, your task is to make everyone fall in love with you within the given time and collect declarations of true love from all participants."
 

 
"Note that among you six players, there will be one male Sea King and one female Sea King. Our show is very gender-equal; no matter whether you’re a man or a woman, everyone has a chance to experience the hardships of love."
 

 
"And regardless of whether you are a Sea King, Judge, or a regular player, there is a ‘True Love’ app on your phone. This is the app you will use to express your feelings. Its function is quite simple."
 

 
The host opened an app with a pink heart icon on their phone: "You can use it to send messages to other players, and you can also enter the name of the player you have feelings for.”
 

 
A huge peach-pink heart appeared, with a space in the middle where you could indeed enter a name.
 

 
Romantic music started playing at just the right moment—
 

 
"I have never been so certain, so sure, about who would be my destiny..."
 

 
"Please remember, once you enter a player's name, it cannot be changed."
 

 
"Until your halo descends into my dark night..."
 

 
A delicate-looking girl with glasses timidly raised her hand, "What if we realize the person is a Sea King after entering their name?"
 

 
The music stopped abruptly.
 

 
The host smiled slightly.
 

 
This smile was a bit different; it clashed slightly with the warm and sweet atmosphere of the setup:
 

 
"Then you still can't change it. After all, in reality, even if most of us find out our partners are jerks, it's hard to let them go."
 

 
The girl with glasses pressed her lips together, her eyes turning red; she was also a player with a story.
 

 
"The condition for the commoners to win is to mutually become each other's true love."
 

 
"For the Sea King, the goal is to make everyone fall in love with them."
 

 
"Note that if a player doesn't feel moved or fall for anyone, and safely makes it through the entire show, they can win a cash prize and earn the title of [Solitary King]!"
 

 
Before drawing the cards, everyone had to introduce themselves. The girl with glasses was named Zhong Muxi. She said she no longer trusted men after being hurt by a jerk and didn't need love anymore, claiming she would definitely not fall for the Sea King's tricks: "On this show, not falling in love is the rule for winning, so as long as I don't draw the Sea King card, I'm confident I'll get the Solitary King's prize."
 

 
The crowd generously applauded her.
 

 
Concubine Chen was unimpressed: "The more someone claims they’ll never love again, the harder they usually fall the next time. Love and men are both wonderful things; it’s just that her experience with one was bad. Someone in their early twenties saying such naive things is likely to be deceived again."
 

 
The female reporter laughed: "I suspect you’re talking about Master Lu Xian and even have evidence to prove it."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "Let’s all chant together like Master Lu Xian: 'Solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary.'"
 

 
It was Wei Zekai's turn. He swaggered up to draw a card, only to have his hand held back by the host, who told him he needed to introduce himself first.
 

 
Young Master Wei was a bit stunned. Wherever he went before, everyone already knew who he was.
 

 
But in the entertainment industry, he was a nobody.
 

 
The male guests all seemed to want to showcase themselves, especially He Shun, who earlier had an impressive self-introduction, boasting his title as an investor and sharing his shining success stories. However, Tong Zhao knew that, at present, Wei Zekai was just a student taking online courses, not good at anything, and best known for losing money.
 

 
Sure enough, he said, "I’m Wei Zekai, born into the wealthy second-generation by talent, currently a university student, and planning to transition into an investor in the future."
 

 
Amid the uproarious laughter, Tong Zhao really wanted to turn her face away and not look at this fool.
 

 
However, the female guest Chang Xiaonian, who had previously said she’d never been in a relationship, was staring at him with bright eyes, as if she genuinely saw his spiritual richness and extraordinary personal charm.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to go up, the finale.
 

 
"Do I also have to introduce myself?”
 

 
She was the only celebrity among them, and the host smiled and nodded.
 

 
Tong Zhao naturally showcased herself in front of the camera, her flawless beauty radiating a confident ease. As she casually glanced around, her dazzling presence captivated everyone, leaving both men and women momentarily stunned. "I’m Tong Zhao, a newcomer in Instinct Films. Fans on Weibo often say they’re curious about what I’d be like in a relationship. Since dating in real life isn’t possible, I’ve come on this show to have some fun."
 

 
The host seized the opportunity to ask curiously, "Why can't you date in real life? Does your manager not allow it?"
 

 
"No time."
 

 
Tong Zhao spread her hands in a helpless gesture.
 

 
It’s partly because she’s busy, and partly because it’s hard to please everyone.
 

 
Although each persona is still her, just as a woman's preferences in partners can change throughout her life, each of her different personas has its own slight preferences. Then there’s Han Zhi, who she can't quite figure out if he likes men or women.
 

 
So, until she meets a man who can accept her fully...
 

 
Forget it, no need to trouble anyone.
 

 
Finally, the host let her draw a card.
 

 
Everyone would draw two cards: one for their apparent role setting and one for their special identity card.
 

 
The two cards Tong Zhao drew were...
 

 
[Student]
 

 
Message: With zero dating experience, only by studying hard can you earn life points.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
Message: A great beauty wants to keep multiple suitors—there’s no one you can’t take away.
 

 
After reading the contents of the cards, Tong Zhao put them away without a hint of emotion on her face. She could feel that she was the focus of everyone’s gaze, with each person observing her expression for clues. Since this was just a warm-up promo, lingering too long wouldn’t be good, so after everyone had drawn their cards, the host announced that the filming for the day was over.
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly came over and whispered, "I drew a super awesome identity, but I won’t tell you now!"
 

 
"Even if you told me, you’d forget such key information after entering the reality show," she replied.
 

 
Tong Zhao waved goodbye to the host, director, and crew.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, "Shall I give you a ride back? Today, I’m driving a green car—it goes perfectly with my outfit today."
 

 
Young Master Wei's level of material wealth was just that ridiculous.
 

 
While an average rich second-generation might choose a car based on their mood, he had the same model in every color, just to match his daily outfits.
 

 
"Sister Chu assigned me an assistant and a driver, so I don't need a ride."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
The two walked side by side to the underground parking lot. Young Master Wei glanced in the direction Tong Zhao indicated and spotted a dull gray nanny van, showing a look of barely concealed disdain.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew he was about to give his "high opinions" again, so she reminded him, "Keep it high EQ."
 

 
"This car of yours..."
 

 
Wei Zekai managed to squeeze out a compliment: "It’s pretty safe. Just looking at it, you can tell it won’t get hijacked."
 

 
※
 

 
The preview video of this reality show aired, and it unexpectedly received a good response.
 

 
Tong Zhao was recently in the spotlight, and netizens were very curious about her. She was a treasure yet to be fully discovered, especially since she was appearing on a reality show that couldn’t hide one's true nature... It was quite bold, and netizens' prying curiosity reached new heights, with discussions on major forums and websites fervently rising:
 

 
“Anyone who has seen *Countdown* knows Tong Zhao is set to be the Solitary Queen. She’s stunning on her own and doesn’t need a man.”
 

 
“Waiting to see Concubine Chen slay the entire scene. Is there really a man who can escape the Empress's grasp?”
 

 
“The wealthy second-generation is hilarious! Seems like he already knows Tong Zhao? Could he be her boyfriend outside the industry?”
 

 
Opinions on Tong Zhao among drama fans were as polarized as a diode.
 

 
Those from *The Legend of Emperor Ming* thought she was the Sea King.
 

 
Those who got into the fandom from *Countdown* felt she didn’t need a man at all and seemed like a tough, ironclad woman.
 

 
Controversy breeds heat, and the director felt his decision to involve Wei Zekai was absolutely correct. This handsome and charismatic young man was a natural focal point. Netizens quickly dug up his Weibo, Instagram, and even his gaming affiliations, discovering that he was a genuine wealthy second-generation heir, but…
 

 
"The second-generation heir photo dug up from Wei Zekai's Weibo—The question is, whose old, shabby background is that?"
 

 
This post generated a lot of discussion and went viral that afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked.
 

 
His first thought wasn’t about his privacy being violated.
 

 
He sent two WeChat messages to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I told you the place you rented couldn't be lived in!"
 

 
"It seems this generation of netizens isn't very emotionally intelligent either!"
# Chapter27
The manager also sent Tong Zhao the related news.
 

 
Since Wei Zekai's Weibo post caused a stir, the subsequent reactions included sharp-eyed netizens discovering that Tong Zhao and that group of rich second-generation heirs were all mutual followers on Weibo. Furthermore, in that group photo, she was definitely in the center position, not looking like a small star being casually played with by the second-generation heirs, but rather like a close friend.
 

 
[Hasn't anyone dug up Tong Zhao's background yet?]
 

 
[A post from her middle school classmate on the eighth forum group says her family is very wealthy and that she's in the same circle as these second-generation heirs.]
 

 
[Wealthy but living in an old, shabby place? The nanny car Tong Zhao uses is also quite low-end.] (Wei Zekai secretly liked this post)
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn't want to give his eldest daughter a "white and rich" image, so he naturally wouldn't admit it directly, and Xu Zhu felt the same way.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao perfectly agreed with them on this.
 

 
Who would care about being the Tong family’s daughter?
 

 
If it weren’t for the fact that her mother’s last name was Tong, she would have changed her surname before debuting.
 

 
As a result, the real information was ignored, while the false information was spread convincingly—
 

 
It was said that Tong Zhao came from a grassroots background, which was why she had a tough and resilient subconscious.
 

 
Which rich young lady hasn’t been pampered and cherished growing up? Who could have the courage to face challenges without any help?
 

 
“Is Wei Zekai your boyfriend? It’s fine if you're really in love, and you two do seem to match. Just remember not to let your manager be the last person to know about your relationship.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked.
 

 
“It’s not true. I’ll have him clarify…”
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao thought she might have a chance to fight back, she realized that she and Wei Zekai would soon be filming a dating reality show together. Given her identity card, she would definitely have to flirt with Wei, and anything could happen. She decided to stop talking: “In any case, we’re not dating. If we were, would I still be living in that small apartment? I’d have to respond, right? As if nothing happened?”
 

 
Sister Chu said it was fine since she had her own work.
 

 
In the era of Instinct Films, the moral standards for "actors" had dropped to a new low.
 

 
After all, it’s instinctual; anything can happen in a show.
 

 
For example, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, once faced widespread online criticism but didn’t lose all her opportunities. On the contrary, her deeply selfish portrayal attracted a group of self-interested fans and offered more negative roles.
 

 
As long as the “true self” has character and charm, it can keep attracting attention over time.
 

 
“Alright.”
 

 
Tong Zhao decided not to respond publicly and also instructed her team to stay silent.
 

 
Once the investment results come through, the rumors will naturally die down.
 

 
Her team liked this feeling of holding back their big move and agreed unanimously with Tong Zhao’s request to ignore the netizens' speculations about their relationship. Thus, the public perception of Tong Zhao settled into the image of a “grassroots girl who gets along well with the second-generation heirs.”
 

 
The controversy over the group photo cooled down significantly after that.
 

 
Just because of that photo, Tong Zhao's residence was dug up by keen-eyed netizens, and that very day, some fans showed up at her door asking for autographs. Feeling helpless, she had to borrow some money from Wei Zekai and move to a community with better security—
 

 
Given her current level of fame, she indeed couldn’t afford to live in a poor place any longer.
 

 
Wei Zekai, knowing he was in the wrong, personally drove her to the move.
 

 
Seeing her furniture nearly deforming his sports car, Tong Zhao sighed with a tinge of discomfort.
 

 
"I spent more on moving company services than you’d spend fixing this car," she remarked.
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t pleased with this comment.
 

 
He thought his driving skills were a hundred thousand times better than those of the moving company: "I can reach your new home in ten minutes; this car goes from 0 to 100 in just 2.9 seconds..."
 

 
"City speed limits, thank you."
 

 
※
 

 
Once the moving ordeal was over, the day for filming *Sea King Killer* arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The director added all the cast members to a WeChat group so they could get to know each other in advance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t check the conversations in the group, and Wei Zekai had directly muted them.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, enthusiastically added her as a friend. Since she needed to interact with him for work, she accepted the request and took the opportunity to learn more about her potential target— the female Sea King corresponds to all the male players. She asked Concubine Chen to also check out his social media.
 

 
He Shun’s social media was very glamorous and filled with the aura of successful individuals.
 

 
“The appreciation of RMB is the most important factor in offshore RMB liquidity expectations...”
 

 
“Next week, I will be giving a lecture at K University as an alumnus...”
 

 
“Self-discipline is a prerequisite for success [Fist][Fist]”
 

 
“Appropriate rest is also important! [Attached a filtered snapshot of first-class cabin with a Mac]”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “What a boring man. If His Majesty posted something like, ‘Have you seen the Golden Hall at 4 a.m.? Do you know how hard I work?’ I would vomit.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: “Haven’t we seen him in person? Let’s analyze based on his social media.”
 

 
Concubine Chen, having the leisure to indulge her, responded: “He probably doesn’t listen to others. His politeness in front of women is just an act. Once someone is out of his control, his true nature will show. However, if you go along with his temperament, you’ll quickly fall under his spell.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed; he was indeed the type she had no interest in.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, had a lot of interest in her and invited her twice, but she had to refuse due to scheduling conflicts.
 

 
Concubine Chen, growing a bit annoyed, said: “Let him try a few more times. I’ll make him regret it and give him a psychological scar about women.”
 

 
The other personas were in awe.
 

 
The filming set for *Sea King Killer* was located in the villa area of the film city.
 

 
The holographic variety show would last for more than half a month, and the actors couldn’t stay in the set all the time. Therefore, medical teams and fitness trainers were provided to ensure that actors left the set daily for their required exercise to prevent muscle atrophy. This was a government mandate to prevent exploitative practices by unscrupulous production teams.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to arrive.
 

 
By the time she arrived, it was already quite late, and she found that the guest lineup was not complete; a male guest was missing.
 

 
Seeing her arrival, the director immediately approached her to explain: “Here’s the situation. The third male guest, Lu Yiqi… he’s in custody and won’t be able to make it to the shoot.”
 

 
“In custody?”
 

 
“For drunk driving.”
 

 
Tong Zhao understood; it seemed he was temporarily out of reach.
 

 
For holographic variety shows exceeding ten days of filming, due to certain risks, applications had to be reported in advance. Missing one person was acceptable, but adding one more was a serious legal issue, so the crew couldn’t find a replacement: “We’re filming with one less person?”
 

 
The director looked resigned: “It has to be this way, but there’s another issue…”
 

 
“You can go ahead.”
 

 
“Lu Yiqi drew the male Sea King card.”
 

 
That’s really problematic.
 

 
The Sea King has a key role; missing one significantly reduces the appeal.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but glance at Wei Zekai, suspecting that his bad luck was affecting everything he was involved in.
 

 
“Others don’t know yet. Our production team has discussed and has a somewhat unwelcome request,” the director said, biting his lip as he revealed their solution: “We can create a new male model for you. This way, your Sea King card in the show will have the ability to transform.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned for a moment.
 

 
Realizing that the idea was a bit outrageous, the director adopted a very humble stance and pleaded with her: “The pre-show hype has been so great, and we really don’t want to let this show, which is about to become a hit, slip away. We will also give you more screen time and opportunities to perform. What do you think?”
 

 
What did she think?
 

 
The more she looked at it, the more she felt that this director and the dog system were cut from the same cloth.
 

 
At that time, she had no preparation at all; she had just been transmigrated into a young, handsome guy named Han Zhi and lived a life as a man. Consequently, her mental palace also gained a male persona…
 

 
“Alright, but the model has to be handsome.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath and woke up the well-rested Han Zhi in her mind.
 

 
[Brother Zhi, get up and get to work.]
# Chapter28
Playing dual roles is almost impossible in instinctive films.
 

 
The vast majority of people's consciousness isn't strong enough to sustain it.
 

 
The director sought out Tong Zhao because the difference in character between Concubine Gui and Feng Yanqi is particularly large, and it's guessed that she has the best chance of handling it.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the medical team prepared for her by conducting a full set of brain scans and simple psychological tests to ensure her health wouldn’t be affected. They also assured her: “Dividing a person's consciousness into two parts can easily become particularly one-sided and extreme. We will explain to the audience that this is an exceptional case. If the modeling fails during the film, then… we’ll just have to accept losing one guest!”
 

 
In the end, everything was normal.
 

 
However, the medical team was puzzled by a set of codes in Tong Zhao's brain that could not be decrypted and were quite numerous. They suggested she visit a more specialized hospital or research institute for a check-up after filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled but remained silent.
 

 
The other guests, unaware of the change in situation, had already settled into the filming cabin early.
 

 
To split into two virtual models, the production team temporarily applied for the highest-level filming cabin, allowing Tong Zhao to sit alone in a more sophisticated filming device, covered in sensors. She closed her eyes, feeling a bit uneasy.
 

 
Han Zhi comforted her: "Don’t worry, the worst-case scenario is just that I’ll end up in the female model."
 

 
Concubine Gui: "I’m very worried. I don’t want to be a tofu grinder!"
 

 
…
 

 
Other personalities, along with Tong Zhao, gave sidelong glances at Concubine Gui's harsh words.
 

 
Under the influence of medication, Tong Zhao fell into a deep sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
"Can it really work?"
 

 
Backstage, the assistant director voiced everyone's concerns.
 

 
There have been cases of a person playing dual roles before.
 

 
There was an actor with a very strong “id” who, in a film exploring the self, split off another version of himself. As a result, he ended up with two extremely contrasting roles: one was aggressive and domineering towards subordinates, while the other was timid and insecure, craving others’ approval… In fact, combined, they represented the actor's true “id.” Every personality has both positive and negative sides, and theoretically, it should be possible.
 

 
But this was a renowned actor with a strong subconscious!
 

 
After being honed through dozens of instinctive films, Tong Zhao's consciousness thickness couldn't compare to someone who had acted in only two works.
 

 
A props team member muttered, “At worst, just act really effeminate. Anyway, Tong Zhao is good-looking, so being effeminate can be seen as being a pretty boy.”
 

 
“Success in separation!”
 

 
“Compatibility 100%, deployment can proceed.”
 

 
After a busy period for the backstage staff, Tong Zhao's consciousness was successfully split into two—
 

 
Countless people are curious about the composition of the soul.
 

 
Does the soul have weight?
 

 
What happens when a person loses their soul?
 

 
What exactly is the soul?
 

 
Is it in the heart or the brain?
 

 
The director sighed: “The code deconstructed from this scan should represent a person’s soul!”
 

 
※
 

 
On a perfectly sunny afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai got out of a luxury car with a suitcase and walked up to a mansion.
 

 
The mansion was surrounded by tall walls with greenery, and it had its own courtyard with the elegant sound of a small bridge and flowing water. From any angle, it could be called a mansion. However, Wei Zekai, wearing silver noise-canceling headphones, frowned slightly as he looked over the high-cost rental model code for the mansion used by the production team, clicking his tongue and saying, “This?”
 

 
…
 

 
“Can we drop a set of bird droppings code on him now? It should be quite explosive, right? The audience will support me! Modeling team, don’t you want to teach him a lesson?”
 

 
A props team member, who had developed a bit of envy toward the wealthy, earnestly sought advice from the modeling team.
 

 
To enhance the realism of the instinctive variety show, after the filming begins, guests are unaware that they are being recorded the entire time and only know they need to complete the task at hand. The brain automatically disregards any strange aspects.
 

 
For example, Wei Zekai's role, like in real life, is that of a super-rich second-generation heir. The production team discovered that viewers were very interested in his wealthy background, believing it would create good chemistry on the show.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai was portrayed as someone sent by his family to stay here for a month while also searching for a partner.
 

 
As he walked into the mansion, he answered a call from home: “I’ve arrived. Got it, stop nagging. If you keep insisting I bring a girlfriend back, I’ll bring a boyfriend back to surprise you!”
 

 
Of course, this was also a call arranged by the production team.
 

 
Combined with the voiceover and subtitles added in post-production, the audience quickly learned the current situation of the guests: they were to live in the mansion for a month and develop relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai did not disappoint the production team; his brief words effectively painted the image of a rebellious young man.
 

 
He turned the door handle and found three people already waiting inside.
 

 
Passing through the foyer, the entrance led to a spacious and luxurious living room. The three-story structure included multifunctional rooms, a maid’s room, a wine cellar, and numerous bedrooms, too many to count. Since everyone was required to gather first, three people were scattered on the living room sofa.
 

 
A young girl wearing glasses and another sweet-looking girl were whispering to each other, while a stern-looking man sat in an armchair, giving Wei Zekai a polite smile.
 

 
“The rooms on the second floor without nameplates are free to choose. You can put your luggage in a room first. There are still two people who haven’t arrived yet,” said the sweet girl in response to Wei Zekai’s puzzled look. “I’m Chang Xiaonian. The girl with glasses is Zhong Muxi, and this is Mr. He.”
 

 
“You don’t have a name?”
 

 
Wei Zekai turned to the man.
 

 
Mr. He smiled and said, “Just call me He Shun.”
 

 
“I’m Wei Zekai. Feel free to call me however you like.”
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced around the second floor, with the camera following his movements.
 

 
He looked back at the three people downstairs with confusion: “Aren’t there only maid’s rooms on the second floor? They’re so small!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi: “……”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian calmly responded, “The rooms are all the same size. They’re not small at all.”
 

 
In the instinctive variety show, Wei Zekai's emotional intelligence was on full display.
 

 
The backstage staff were tempted to arrange a bit of "heavenly bird droppings" for him.
 

 
Previously, the three who arrived first had marveled at the luxurious accommodations provided by the activity, saying it felt like a vacation. Anyone in such an environment would likely be inspired to pursue a romantic relationship!
 

 
Zhong Muxi had a poor impression of him and muttered quietly, “How can he be like this? The rooms are already very nice.”
 

 
“Wei Zekai… that name sounds familiar.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took out her phone to look him up online.
 

 
Of course, the information she found was about the character's background arranged by the production team.
 

 
But it was not much different from the real Wei Zekai.
 

 
Displayed before the two were countless names of industries and chain groups, along with some news highlighting his immense wealth. Zhong Muxi clicked her tongue in disdain and felt even less favorably towards him: “Someone this rich must definitely not lack women.”
 

 
“I actually think he’s pretty good,” Chang Xiaonian said, her eyes showing admiration after discovering Wei Zekai’s great wealth.
 

 
After Wei Zekai came downstairs, Chang Xiaonian took the initiative to explain the details of the activity.
 

 
It was similar to what the host had introduced earlier, but with added details about daily life.
 

 
“You must return to the mansion and clock in every night, and you can’t engage in any intimate behaviors like kissing or hugging. You can only choose one person as your romantic interest,” Chang Xiaonian read from the booklet. Seeing the "sea king" rules, Wei Zekai clicked his tongue again and said, “What the heck, a sea king? I despise people like that the most! It’s a desecration of pure love!”
 

 
……
 

 
The backstage staff were all shocked.
 

 
Their impression of the wealthy second-generation heir was rather stereotypical, and Wei Zekai’s reveal of a mermaid tattoo during the pre-show recording only added to his Playboy image. They didn’t expect his “true self” to make such a cliché statement about “pure love.”
 

 
Director: “...Instinctive variety shows are truly full of surprises.”
 

 
The writer, excited, said: “We could add a ‘Judge’s Comment’ effect in post-production. It turns out giving him that card was spot on.”
 

 
Wei Zekai plopped down into an armchair, acting all high and mighty.
 

 
“There are still two people missing. No sense of time at all, so disappointing.” After complaining, he put on his noise-canceling headphones and started playing a mobile game.
 

 
The wait extended from a clear afternoon to a cloudy evening.
 

 
Soon, the villa was enveloped in heavy rain, with occasional thunder adding a touch of a crime scene atmosphere reminiscent of a Conan murder case. It wasn’t really the fault of the “two people” for lacking a sense of time; it was because Tong Zhao was undergoing consciousness splitting and reorganization, which delayed her entry into the holographic space.
 

 
“The weather is so bad. Do you think they might come tomorrow instead?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked softly.
 

 
She wasn’t very confident in her own words and immediately turned her gaze to Chang Xiaonian, who had just become her friend. As Chang Xiaonian was about to speak, the door was opened—
 

 
In the foyer stood a young girl enveloped in a transparent raincoat.
 

 
Beneath the raincoat, she wore a pure white chiffon dress, the hem of which did not reach her knees. Her slender, beautiful legs were bathed in the soft light of the foyer, giving her skin a flawless, creamy appearance.
 

 
The raincoat was slightly oversized, making the girl seem even smaller, as if only her palm-sized face was peeking into the living room. Her light-colored eyes reflected a mix of innocent bewilderment and curiosity about the new place.
 

 
Even the production team, who had seen Tong Zhao in person before, were astonished by her appearance.
 

 
The director was a bit surprised: “She doesn’t look like Feng Yanqi at all.”
 

 
“Actually, she doesn’t look like Concubine Gui either.”
 

 
“No, she does,” said the staff member, a fan of Tong Zhao, who had gotten into it through *The Legend of Ming Dynasty* and had repeatedly watched the edited videos on Bilibili: “She looks especially like Concubine Gui when she first entered the palace!”
 

 
Enchanting men is an art, a skill that Concubine Gui absorbed from her experiences in the harem.
 

 
Starting with a weak position is always a safe choice.
 

 
……
 

 
“Sorry, I got stuck in traffic due to the typhoon.”
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke with a voice that was both soft and delicate, more pleasing than a nightingale's song.
 

 
She looked like a small white flower battered by a storm, innocent and pitiable.
 

 
The character background template implanted in Tong Zhao’s mind was that of a financially struggling female student.
 

 
Her parents had passed away, her grandmother was critically ill, and she needed to win this event to secure the prize money for her grandmother’s medical expenses and her own tuition fees.
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao's entrance, the director decided to have the voiceover introduce this background immediately.
 

 
From the moment she appeared, the audience became curious about this seemingly poisonous white flower.
 

 
“Am I the last one?” She frowned, looking very apologetic.
 

 
“No, there’s one more. You’re not the last to arrive.”
 

 
He Shun came to his senses, immediately stood up from the sofa, and took her luggage with a warm but not overly familiar attitude, explaining the details of the event. After receiving a grateful and admiring look from the pretty girl, he volunteered to help carry her luggage to her room.
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed uninterested in the other female guests and instead focused her beautiful eyes on Wei Zekai, who was engrossed in his game.
 

 
[This one seems a bit challenging.]
 

 
The production team captured her inner monologue.
 

 
Clearly, in her view, He Shun was just a simple, easygoing type of man.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually chose a bedroom without fussing over its size.
 

 
He Shun, being very gentlemanly, only carried her luggage into the room and didn’t step further inside. He returned to the living room sofa and explained to everyone, “Tong Zhao needs some time to freshen up before coming downstairs.”
 

 
“If you hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have known her name was Tong Zhao.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian said, a bit dissatisfied.
 

 
Women understand women best, and she immediately had a negative impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Since arriving, Tong Zhao’s gaze had only lingered on the men, briefly glancing at the two women, with her focus clearly on the men.
# Chapter29
The heavy rain was still continuing.
 

 
The three of them were hungry, so Chang Xiaonian went to the kitchen first to check the situation.
 

 
The usual pots, plates, spices, and cooking oil were all present, and the full rice jar was reassuring. The refrigerator was packed with drinks. However, there was a very conspicuous sticky note on the fridge:
 

 
[Ingredients in the kitchen are limited and will not be replenished once used.]
 

 
[Please make sure to complete tasks to earn living resources before the ingredients run out]
 

 
After explaining the situation to the others, Chang Xiaonian, a bit embarrassed, said, “I’m sorry, but I only know how to order takeout and make instant noodles…”
 

 
The other two showed similar awkward expressions.
 

 
Here, only Wei Zekai, with his “rich second-generation” identity, had the freedom to use money for takeout. However, given the torrential rain and the remote location of the villa, no delivery person was willing to come. Chang Xiaonian sighed, “Who would deliver without ten times the delivery fee!”
 

 
She glanced at Wei Zekai.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t care about the tenfold delivery fee.
 

 
And indeed, he didn’t.
 

 
However, what Wei Zekai said next surprised the staff:
 

 
“Is this a matter of money? With an eighth-level typhoon and torrential rain outside, if a delivery person is tempted by the tenfold fee and something happens to them while delivering, how long would I feel bad about it? I’d be at a loss.”
 

 
How could he...
 

 
Turn such morally high-grounded statements into a pompous rant?
 

 
The production team felt conflicted.
 

 
“I can’t cook either,” He Shun said, looking at the closed door on the second floor. “I don’t know if Tong Zhao can, but she just arrived, so let her rest for a while. Can’t the kitchen have some unpacked food? Surely, she can boil water and cook noodles.”
 

 
Saying this, he seemed just as unwilling to make a move.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at him anxiously.
 

 
She could actually cook, though not particularly well. She had been used as a free maid by her ex for two years, and since the breakup, she had been afraid to show her capable side in front of men... [What’s the use of being capable? Being a nanny to men will only make you seem like an old hag.]
 

 
This bit of negative mental activity was also captured by the AI.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows amplify human traits infinitely; as long as they hit a point of resonance with the audience, they can achieve high ratings.
 

 
Accompanied by the rumbling thunder, the three people with their own agendas fell into silence.
 

 
The door was opened again.
 

 
The man folded his black umbrella. The rain had left droplets on his dark hair, and his white shirt was slightly damp, clinging to his skin and outlining well-defined lines. His chest muscles and abs were enough to make one instinctively swallow. After putting away the umbrella and changing into indoor shoes, he looked up at everyone, revealing an exceptionally handsome face.
 

 
He was stunningly handsome.
 

 
If it weren’t for the sharp jawline, one might believe he was a beautiful woman.
 

 
The man obviously looked tired from the journey; his light amber eyes were not sparkling and lacked the intimidating sharpness. They resembled those of a slightly tipsy traveler, clouded with an indescribable haze, giving anyone a poetic sense of unspoken thoughts.
 

 
He was very tired.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao, having just finished washing her hair and wearing a floral nightgown with half-dry hair, emerged from the bedroom and met his gaze.
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
[Wow, top-notch.]
 

 
“Sorry for arriving a bit late,”
 

 
The man didn’t think much of it and simply smiled at everyone:
 

 
“Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ meaning ‘persistent.’”
 

 
……
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao, the two female guests blushed simultaneously.
 

 
He Shun was handsome among successful people and a looker even among ordinary folks, while Wei Zekai was a young, attractive man who could live off his looks. However, compared to the man in front of them… they fell far short. Even a single glance from Han Zhi was on a completely different level. No woman could resist him, even if he was tired.
 

 
Or perhaps because Han Zhi was tired.
 

 
A handsome and commanding man gives off a sense of pressure. Women are drawn to strength and also have a certain maternal instinct, and Han Zhi embodied the perfect combination of these two qualities.
 

 
Han Zhi was composed; through his eyes, one could feel his rock-solid inner strength. No problem could defeat him, and there was nothing he couldn’t solve. Indecisive and weak-willed? He was certainly someone you could rely on. At the same time, he seemed tired, and if you met his gaze, he would wave you over to rest your head on his shoulder, gently kiss the top of your head, and be tender and affectionate.
 

 
At this moment, the production team’s identity card for him was gradually revealed through special effects and narration:
 

 
【“The King of the Sea” and “Writer” Han Zhi. He is an unknown writer who attracts female readers through his good looks and receives continuous rewards. His book signings are like star meet-and-greets. His editor once lamented that if his writing were a bit better, he wouldn’t be so poor.】
 

 
【Han Zhi’s early life was full of women. He sought fame and praise, was always chasing new interests while getting bored with the old, and no matter how beautiful the woman, she could not stay on his girlfriend’s throne for more than a month.】
 

 
After understanding the current situation, Han Zhi said, “Wait for me to change clothes, and then I’ll make dinner.”
 

 
Hearing that someone volunteered to cook, Wei Zekai took off his headphones and looked at him appreciatively: “Thanks, brother. I’m starving.”
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian regretted not having learned how to cook better.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa drying her hair, which was also a dramatic, murder-like gesture.
 

 
The director was completely unprepared for the normally efficient and sharp Tong Zhao to appear as a naive and cute water lily in this reality show.
 

 
As Tong Zhao dried her hair, she shivered and sneezed.
 

 
She rubbed her red nose, and her unadorned face appeared even more charming.
 

 
She was already a young girl, and with this youthful appearance, she looked like a little loli.
 

 
If Tong Zhao's inner thoughts hadn't been captured, this would indeed be a very cute scene.
 

 
However, the production team clearly heard Tong Zhao, after casting a shy glance at Han Zhi’s waist, think to herself: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
If Han Zhi were another male celebrity, this could have caused a major incident.
 

 
But considering Han Zhi's true identity as an “extreme” type, the production team exchanged a complex look…
 

 
After changing into casual clothes, Han Zhi went straight to the kitchen to cook.
 

 
Soon, a spread of two meat dishes and three vegetable dishes was served on the long table in the living room. Han Zhi also made a mushroom soup. After everyone tasted it, they were captivated by the incredibly fresh and delicious flavor, each person drinking two large bowls.
 

 
He Shun was surprised, "Mr. Han’s cooking skills are really impressive. Young people these days... well, actually me too, are used to eating takeout. We get so used to it that we forget how to cook, and the mere thought of cooking is a headache."
 

 
"My ex-girlfriend had a stomach condition and couldn’t eat takeout," Han Zhi said, laughing at himself. "After we broke up, I didn’t let my cooking skills go to waste. Being able to make sure everyone doesn’t go hungry today is a way for them to come in handy."
 

 
His mastery of language was employed to its fullest extent.
 

 
He didn’t say why they broke up, but how bad could a man who learned to cook for a girlfriend with a stomach issue be? Coupled with his slightly melancholic eyes, his affectionate image was vividly conveyed in just a few sentences.
 

 
Indeed, Zhong Muxi, who remained cautious around all males, cast a sympathetic look toward him.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished a bowl of rice, she looked up with a satisfied smile and said, "I really envy Han Zhi’s girlfriend."
 

 
Her obedient and sweet little loli image was well established.
 

 
But despite how soft and sweet her voice sounded, the intelligent AI scanning of her inner thoughts revealed a starkly contrasting, coldly mocking sentiment:
 

 
[All men’s descriptions of their exes are probably all the same.]
 

 
[Think about it. Which man would brag about being abandoned by an ex? It’s not just about hiding it; they wouldn’t mention it at all. Showing weakness always hides something ulterior—he’s just trying to create a sentimental image.]
 

 
[The cooking is actually quite good.]
 

 
“Same here.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, who enjoyed the meal, chimed in with a somewhat awkward tone.
 

 
And his inner thoughts were quite honest: [Wow, this soup is delicious. I really want to hire him as a personal chef.]
 

 
After the meal, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi took on the responsibility of washing the dishes voluntarily.
 

 
Han Zhi, who cooked, was not expected to wash dishes as well.
 

 
This also highlighted the "true selves" of the remaining three.
 

 
The chauvinistic He Shun thought that anything related to housework had nothing to do with men.
 

 
Wei Zekai always believed that dishes and furniture would clean themselves automatically and that meals would appear hot and ready on time.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao…
 

 
[Fortunately, I wasn’t asked to wash dishes. But if I were, I’d need to find a good tool to help.]
 

 
The production team: "..."
 

 
This is just too lazy!
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really this lazy?
 

 
Feng Yanqi’s character was not like this!
 

 
The assistant director clicked his tongue in amazement: “Good looks really give an advantage. I actually don’t find her annoying. She’s like a kitten looking for a caretaker, glancing around.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was assessing the three men in her mind.
 

 
[Wei Zekai clearly can’t do housework. He’s a useless layabout.]
 

 
[The top-notch guy should be saved for later. He’s a bit hard to figure out. I’ll handle the others first. Anyway, Han Zhi doesn’t seem the type to back off just because someone else is flirting.]
 

 
[Hmm, let’s start with the guy named He!]
 

 
The female sea king took the initiative, and the production team perked up, knowing there would be content to film.
 

 
What is the modern version of a queen’s flirtation like?
 

 
At the same time, the night fell.
 

 
After everyone clocked in and returned to their rooms:
 

 
When Wei Zekai got back to his room, he didn’t continue playing games. Instead, he took out a collar from his suitcase.
 

 
Though he was alone in the room, he nervously looked around to make sure no one else was present before putting on the collar: “Does it really have this magical function... damn!”
 

 
With a very cartoonish smoke effect, Wei Zekai disappeared.
 

 
In his place was a golden-brown dog.
 

 
[As a bold and unruly prodigy with the titles of "Judgment Officer" and "Rich Second Generation," you have an important task this time besides finding your beloved person—discover the hidden sea king among you and protect true love! To enhance your investigative abilities, you will have the power to transform for one hour each day.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...Woof!”
 

 
What’s the point of guarding someone else’s love?
 

 
But transforming into a dog is quite novel, so Wei Zekai decided to go for a walk.
 

 
The soft little paw pads made no sound as they stepped on the soft mat. The small Zekai quietly made its way downstairs, hearing some noise from the kitchen.
 

 
Hmm?
 

 
Could someone be sneaking a midnight snack?
 

 
Wei Zekai wagged its tail excitedly, curious about who might be so hungry.
 

 
However, as it entered the kitchen, the noise became clearer—it was the sound of a girl sobbing.
 

 
“Why did you have to leave me... couldn’t you stay with me a little longer? I thought many times about you leaving me, but I didn’t expect that when the day actually came... it’s so scary…”
 

 
The frantic and confused whispers, mixed with the suppressed crying, made the little Zekai’s tail bristle.
 

 
It peered around and saw an even more horrifying scene.
 

 
The usually subdued and gloomy Zhong Muxi was repeatedly cutting her wrist with a fruit knife.
 

 
In the place where her watch was removed, there were overlapping fresh and old wounds of varying depths.
 

 
The girl did not intend to end her life.
 

 
Through the pain, she seemed to gradually calm down. After washing the blood off the fruit knife, she regretfully rushed back to her room on the second floor.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was experiencing being a dog for the first time, wanted to hide in shock.
 

 
Although his movements were slow, he stood in a blind spot due to his short legs and was not discovered.
 

 
So, this is how serious the harm from a breakup can be?
 

 
Wei Zekai was deeply shocked.
 

 
He thought about the other two men in the villa, one of whom might be the sea king and a scumbag...
 

 
The little dog shook its fur and wore a serious expression on its face.
 

 
At that moment, it felt a profound sense of mission.
# Chapter30
The camera pulls up, giving a bird's-eye view of the entire estate.
 

 
In the shot, each bedroom door gradually becomes transparent, revealing what each guest is doing.
 

 
The smart AI automatically identifies restricted and overly private scenes.
 

 
If a guest is changing clothes, that door will not become transparent, and even the production team cannot secretly peek.
 

 
...
 

 
He Shun is flipping through a book.
 

 
Zhong Muxi, who has returned to her room, is holding a first aid kit and iodine to treat her wound. She lets her tears slowly dry on her cheeks, her face showing numbness. This small first aid kit is something she brought in her luggage, and it’s clear that this self-harming behavior has been going on for some time. She is also quite accustomed to cleaning up the mess left on her body after an emotional breakdown.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian is lying on the bed playing with her phone, and the smart AI enlarges the screen of her phone.
 

 
"Prince Street No. 23"
 

 
"The Young Master's Rule"
 

 
"Sparrow Wants to Rise"
 

 
"No wonder she's so nice to Wei Zekai; turns out she likes prince-and-princess love stories," the young stagehand said.
 

 
Tong Zhao placed all the bottles and jars she had brought on the desk and was going through a complicated skincare routine. While she was applying body lotion to her calves, the director, with a bit of self-interest, had the camera linger on her for a moment, treating it as a fan-service shot for the audience.
 

 
The camera panned to the last bedroom—Han Zhi's room.
 

 
He was sitting at his desk, holding a sketchbook.
 

 
When drawing, Han Zhi wore glasses. The frameless, square glasses concealed the emotions in his passionate eyes, giving him a touch of cool abstinence and intellect. His pale, slender fingers held a pencil, and in no time, a gentle and simple face appeared on the paper.
 

 
The assistant director widened his eyes in surprise, "He actually likes Zhong Muxi?"
 

 
Who would have thought that the "sea king" would first set his sights on an unremarkable girl with glasses?
 

 
Not to mention Tong Zhao, who is stunningly beautiful, even Chang Xiaonian, who has a sweet and cute style, looks better than Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It's not polite to judge someone's appearance, but the entire production team was genuinely surprised.
 

 
The young stagehand made a sound, "Hmm. Some guys like him are like that. They go after plain, honest girls because they're easier to control... Think about it—if a handsome guy like Han Zhi confessed to you, wouldn't you feel particularly surprised, like you're unworthy? Even if you fought or argued in a relationship, you'd want to slap yourself for it."
 

 
As he spoke, Han Zhi gently tore out the completed sketch from his sketchbook and carefully placed it in the drawer.
 

 
Then, he began to draw on a new page.
 

 
Even if he is handsome, there's no point in continuously filming him just drawing, so the director was about to switch the camera when he noticed something unusual.
 

 
This time, Han Zhi was drawing a different face.
 

 
Lively, spirited round eyes and lips that always curve up into a sweet smile—the face of Chang Xiaonian, who the production team had just been discussing.
 

 
Production team: "..."
 

 
So, he's really just an expert at keeping things balanced?
 

 
After finishing, Han Zhi carefully tore out this sketch as well and put it away.
 

 
The assistant director, who had some experience with sketching from studying art, watched for a while and remarked, "Han Zhi is quite skilled at drawing. You can tell who it is, but he makes them look even better than in real life; he's very good at capturing the highlights."
 

 
Even Zhong Muxi, who was labeled as "ordinary" by the production team, appeared different under Han Zhi's pen. With her eyes lowered, he captured the graceful lines of her neck when she looked down. Only then did everyone realize that Zhong Muxi actually had a nice side profile, with a well-proportioned head and neck, looking fragile and delicate enough to evoke sympathy.
 

 
Han Zhi has a keen eye for discovering the good qualities in others.
 

 
If he could make someone so ordinary look so good, how stunning must Tong Zhao look under his pen?
 

 
The production team couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.
 

 
However, the previously inspired Han Zhi encountered difficulties when drawing the third sketch. Several times, he completed rough drafts only to tear them up and crumple them into a ball. After three repeated attempts, he finally drew a large, messy question mark over the oval face draft he had completed.
 

 
The small night lamp cast a warm glow on half of his face.
 

 
"I'm starting to think I'm filming an idol drama here. He doesn't need much directing at all—he's a man who naturally looks good on camera. Any random shot looks like a movie poster. If Tong Zhao were a man, she might achieve even more success!" the director said.
 

 
Leading roles for women in films are still a rarity.
 

 
You could say it's a blue ocean market, but no one wants to explore it; everyone thinks it's unprofitable. There are almost no actresses who can carry a box office hit—most of them just add a little extra appeal. However, actresses have their strengths: their "true selves" are more consistent and less likely to fall apart in their performances, even if they rarely shine.
 

 
While the production team drifted off-topic, Han Zhi put down his pencil, stuffed the sketchbook into the drawer, and furrowed his brows.
 

 
※
 

 
Early the next morning, Wei Zekai woke up very early.
 

 
He had a nightmare.
 

 
He dreamed that Zhong Muxi had slashed down with a knife, severing the major artery in her wrist, and blood kept gushing out, covering the floor. The fear from the morning shock still lingered. Being a young boy who gets hungry quickly, he habitually goes downstairs. Seeing the empty dining room, he remembered he wasn’t at home; no aunt woke up earlier than everyone to prepare breakfast, and a wave of sadness came over him.
 

 
He hadn’t been sad for long when he smelled the aroma of food.
 

 
Sniffing the air, he walked towards the kitchen and saw a tall, slender figure.
 

 
Han Zhi was cooking something delicious.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up, and at the same time, Han Zhi happened to turn around.
 

 
Han Zhi had no particular interest in cooking for another man, but when he saw the hungry young master staring at him with eyes practically turning green from hunger, he gave a gentle smile. “I’m a bit hungry. If you don’t mind, would you like to eat together?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn't have asked for anything better.
 

 
In the skillet, there was a pot of diced tomatoes, green and red peppers, onions, and bacon being stir-fried, with two sunny-side-up eggs cracked in. The wobbling egg yolks were incredibly appetizing, and the smell was irresistible. The rich tomato juice mixed with the egg yolk, perfectly paired with lightly toasted bread, awakened both the stomach and taste buds in the early morning. Han Zhi had also prepared a pot of plain porridge, blending Western and Eastern styles seamlessly.
 

 
Even Wei Zekai, who was used to eating all kinds of delicacies, was captivated by Han Zhi's cooking skills.
 

 
After hearing Wei Zekai's praise of him, Han Zhi was momentarily stunned and said, "This is just Shakshuka made with last night's leftover scraps, nothing extraordinary."
 

 
Here, a segment of Han Zhi's inner monologue was mixed in:
 

 
[The same goes for love.]
 

 
[When you've dated a lot and have all kinds of beauties at your fingertips, your pursuit begins to diversify. There isn’t a girl who isn't worthy of my love. If other men think a girl is ordinary, it's because they lack the ability to polish a rough diamond or uncover a hidden treasure. That's their incompetence, not the girl's fault.]
 

 
Assistant Director: "Damn, he’s so poetic in his player ways."
 

 
The scriptwriter joked, "How about we cut this part and let me steal it for my novel?"
 

 
The young stagehand was puzzled: "Is that being a player? I think what he said sounds quite pleasant. If this is what being a player is like, I'd like to be played by him!"
 

 
The production team debated endlessly about whether Han Zhi's mindset was considered "playing" or not, until the props team, staying true to their focus, gently reminded them, "Wake up, everyone. He's just a subconscious manifestation split from Tong Zhao; this man doesn’t actually exist in reality."
 

 
The statement jolted everyone to their senses.
 

 
The assistant director, however, came up with a new idea: "Hey, how about we reveal Han Zhi’s true identity only after this season airs?"
 

 
"Good idea! Since Han Zhi has managed to charm the women in our team so thoroughly... Forget about his charisma, just look at that face—who wouldn't love it? Is this really extracted from Tong Zhao's memory? She’s got quite the imagination!"
 

 
"Then, we could create a trending topic like #DemandHanZhiToDebut and build up some hype, followed by a plot twist later. That would definitely make a splash!"
 

 
...
 

 
Amidst their discussions, the rest of the people gradually woke up.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi came to an agreement and cooked a pot of noodles to share, deliberately not making any for Tong Zhao and He Shun.
 

 
After eating their fill, the two girls curled up on the sofa, whispering while watching TV, gossiping about how Tong Zhao was a “green tea bitch.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi hesitated a bit, "She didn’t really do anything, right…?"
 

 
"Women understand women best!" Chang Xiaonian declared confidently. "I knew it last night during dinner. She didn’t even look at us and only responded to the guys. It was super obvious. I just don’t know which one she’s targeting. Hopefully, she’ll leave Wei Zekai alone. I think Teacher He would suit her better; he kept staring at her."
 

 
"That He teacher is pretty annoying too. Calling him 'teacher' is already giving him too much credit. You can tell he’s got a 'straight man cancer' mentality—probably the kind who would dump all the household chores on his wife after marriage and treat her like a nanny. Asking him to step into the kitchen is like asking him to sacrifice himself."
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded silently.
 

 
She wasn’t interested in finding a partner in this event, so she didn’t care who Tong Zhao tried to flirt with. However, Chang Xiaonian was her only female friend in this unfamiliar environment, so she wouldn’t contradict her friend just for Tong Zhao.
 

 
But just as Zhong Muxi nodded, she heard the sound of the sofa sinking down beside her.
 

 
The two were startled and looked toward the source of the sound, only to find that the very person they had been talking about—Tong Zhao—was sitting on the single-seater sofa sipping a yogurt. Her fair and delicate face was adorned with a subtle “no-makeup” makeup look, and her almond-shaped eyes cast a casual, teasing glance in their direction.
 

 
[Did she hear what we were just saying?]
 

 
[Whatever, so what if she did hear? We’re not friends anyway; saying a few bad things behind someone’s back is pretty normal!]
 

 
This was Chang Xiaonian’s inner monologue.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also worried that Tong Zhao had overheard them, so she looked down and pretended to be playing on her phone.
 

 
In this reality show focused on natural interactions, storylines of girls scheming against each other were also very popular with viewers, so the AI instantly captured Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao had indeed heard everything.
 

 
She thought that what Chang Xiaonian said made a lot of sense.
 

 
Concubine Chen wasn't interested in women at all and didn't care about their opinions of her.
 

 
"I totally didn't notice you come over. How do you walk so quietly?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian awkwardly tried to start a conversation.
 

 
Tong Zhao swung her well-proportioned legs and chuckled, "Maybe it's because I'm too light. Oh well, I'll just have to try harder to gain some weight."
 

 
The ordinary girls who gain weight no matter how much they eat: "..."
 

 
Without any men around, the "Concubine" wasn't pretending to be innocent at all.
 

 
At this moment, she resembled a flamboyant carnivorous flower; every glance and smile seemed to flaunt her beauty.
 

 
After speaking, Tong Zhao patted her flat stomach. "Talking about gaining weight makes me hungry. I'll go ask Teacher He to make me something to eat."
 

 
?
 

 
Do you not have hands of your own?
 

 
Question marks popped up in the heads of the two girls.
 

 
After a while, Chang Xiaonian saw He Shun—whom she had labeled as someone who would absolutely never do housework—enter the kitchen with a "can't say no to you" smile and make Tong Zhao a bowl of fried sauce noodles. After she happily finished eating, he even took the initiative to wash the bowl.
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Where did your macho attitude go?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was shocked to her core.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also a bit surprised.
 

 
Teacher He resembled her ex-boyfriend a lot, so when Xiaonian bluntly said that He Shun would never do housework, she agreed wholeheartedly. However, seeing this scene made her somewhat confused.
# Chapter31
"I can’t figure it out."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stole a glance at Tong Zhao, who was happily eating fruit at the long dining table. "It seems like that woman really has her eyes on Teacher He, but... she hasn’t done anything at all. Why is Mr. He being so attentive to her?"
 

 
"I don’t know either."
 

 
Zhong Muxi looked down, hiding the envy in her eyes.
 

 
He Shun’s "straight man cancer" was quite evident, and he also showed signs of looking down on women.
 

 
Just like her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
Of course, her ex had many advantages—he was a prominent figure in school, came from a well-off family, and had a smooth career path after graduation. If she hadn’t pursued him in college, she might never have encountered such an outstanding man in the workplace.
 

 
Back then, Zhong Muxi did all the laundry and cooking for her boyfriend, delivering freshly washed fruit to his dorm, and baking handmade cookies and various snacks. Because he had expressed a desire for a virtuous partner, she strived to fit the mold of his ideal companion, believing that meeting the “CHD Girlfriend Requirements” would secure the bright future he had envisioned.
 

 
Zhong Muxi had far exceeded those expectations.
 

 
She didn’t want her boyfriend to worry, so after starting work and moving in together, she took on all the household chores.
 

 
She didn’t dare to stay late at work to improve her performance because she needed to get home earlier than her boyfriend so that he could have hot meals when he arrived after working overtime.
 

 
But all she received in return was increasing impatience.
 

 
Her boyfriend told her to improve herself, but after work, she was too exhausted from cooking and doing housework to have time for the gym. He paid the rent and utilities but never cared about the cost of groceries, yet he would give her the cold shoulder if there was no meat or seafood on the table, putting down his chopsticks after only a few bites.
 

 
Eventually, because she was too ordinary and unambitious, her boyfriend ended their relationship amicably.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t want an amicable breakup, but she couldn’t learn how to cry, argue, or fight.
 

 
So in the end, all her destructive impulses and hatred, like the utility knife in her hand, turned inward, with the blade pointing at herself.
 

 
She lifted her eyes to look at Tong Zhao, who had finished eating and pushed the bowl towards He Shun. Her eyes, behind her glasses, were filled with complex longing.
 

 
After everyone had their fill, the large screen TV in the living room lit up with colorful images.
 

 
The variety show had a main storyline driving the guests’ actions to increase viewer interest.
 

 
In the show, guests had to complete mandatory tasks, which varied randomly. Completing them would yield corresponding random rewards, while failure meant facing penalties.
 

 
Everyone turned their gaze to the giant screen.
 

 
"Love won't come just by sitting around. Now, the official provides you with an opportunity to get familiar with each other. Please choose one and head to the game room!"
 

 
"1: Werewolf"
 

 
"2: Truth or Dare"
 

 
"3: King's Game"
 

 
"Isn't it better to quickly get acquainted by playing Honor of Kings together?" Wei Zekai was unimpressed by the official game options. The first two seemed too old-fashioned, and the third was something he had only heard of in nightclubs and bars, not a serious game.
 

 
Han Zhi said they should follow everyone's preference.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind.
 

 
He Shun naturally took over the decision-making and chose Truth or Dare.
 

 
His internal monologue at this moment also had a personal touch: [Werewolf... this kind of brain-intensive game is no fun when half the participants are women; they think too emotionally. The King's Game is a bit vulgar, so Truth or Dare is a better choice.]
 

 
The stage crew girl said, "I really want to hit him. What should I do?"
 

 
Other female staff members echoed her sentiments.
 

 
---
 

 
The game room was very spacious, equipped with both popular and rare board games.
 

 
As everyone walked into the room, a board labeled “Truth or Dare” was quietly placed on a round table, with chairs around it marked with their names, suggesting they should sit in an alternating gender arrangement.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat between Wei Zekai and Han Zhi.
 

 
He Shun glanced towards her and hesitated before suggesting he wanted to switch seats.
 

 
“Han Zhi…”
 

 
He had just begun to speak when Han Zhi’s piercing gaze made him feel as if his thoughts were being clearly seen through a high-powered lens. He Shun instinctively felt a bit unnerved and instead asked Wei Zekai, who, although tall, was clearly more of a big boy than a man, “Can I switch seats with you?”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t really care where he sat.
 

 
What difference did it make where he sat to play a game?
 

 
Just as he was about to impatiently agree, Wei Zekai suddenly recalled the unsettling scene in the kitchen last night and the heavy responsibility he had—he wasn’t here just to play; finding a partner was secondary. His main goal was to identify the "sea king" among these people.
 

 
He Shun, who seemed to have an inexplicable reason to switch seats, was highly suspicious!
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaze suddenly became sharp.
 

 
“Why do you want to switch seats with me?” Wei Zekai asked, his tone unfriendly.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai's arrogant and overbearing demeanor didn't raise He Shun's suspicions. He simply muttered inwardly about the wealthy but uncultured young master.
 

 
"I’m more familiar with Zhao Zhao and can take better care of her," He Shun said.
 

 
He was speaking the truth.
 

 
Tong Zhao was very poor at taking care of herself.
 

 
She almost burned her hand while boiling water to cook noodles (actually, she hadn't even touched the boiling water; she was just pretending to protect her delicate fingers). She had never washed a dish at home and was a little princess raised under strict care from her family (according to her own story). Although He Shun's mother treated him like a prince, he still had basic life knowledge, but it depended on whether he wanted to apply it.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had never done it, it was only right for him to handle it.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the adoring and dependent look in the young girl's eyes, He Shun couldn't resist and quickly became her tool.
 

 
"Do we really need to take care of each other while playing a game?" Hearing this poor excuse, Wei Zekai’s gaze became even sharper. Although their conversation was quiet, it gradually drew the attention of others. He Shun, feeling embarrassed, said, “Forget it, it’s nothing.” He then returned to his original seat.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who was seated next to He Shun as arranged by the production team, clearly heard everything, and her previous delight at sitting next to Wei Zekai had vanished.
 

 
What’s up with this He guy?
 

 
Is it really such a burden for him to sit next to a girl?
 

 
Does Tong Zhao really need all that special care? Is she like a modern-day princess with her older knight?
 

 
Han Zhi picked up the "Truth or Dare" cards and began shuffling. He held the cards with three fingers, smoothly fanned them with his thumb, first displaying them and then pressing and flipping them in a fluid, pleasing manner.
 

 
Han Zhi said, “The rules are simple: you can’t choose 'Truth' or 'Dare' consecutively.”
 

 
The game room also had a large screen.
 

 
A mechanical synthesized voice explained the rules: “For those who choose 'Dare,' the task will be randomly selected by the official and shown on the screen. For 'Truth,' the player who draws the smallest numbered card will decide whether to answer their own question or one selected by the screen. If a player lies during 'Truth,' the lie detector here will sound.”
 

 
“Questions that are prohibited include:
 

 
- Restricted or offensive questions.
 
- Questions about the identity cards drawn by others.
 
- Players can choose to refuse to answer and directly accept a punishment task.”
 

 
It sounded like choosing 'Truth' was relatively easier.
 

 
In the first round, Han Zhi drew the ghost card.
 

 
"It seems like I'm having bad luck today," Han Zhi said helplessly, shaking the ghost card in his hand. "I'll go with 'Truth.'"
 

 
The player who drew the smallest number card was Wei Zekai.
 

 
What should he ask?
 

 
Wei Zekai had a sudden idea, realizing this was a great opportunity to probe—although he couldn’t directly ask if the person was a playboy, he could indirectly gather the truth and infer the result. The truth was singular, and at this moment, he was like Detective Conan’s grandfather!
 

 
After a moment of contemplation, he cautiously asked, “Could you elaborate on your views on relationships?”
 

 
In Wei Zekai’s limited understanding of emotional intelligence, a playboy was necessarily detestable and had a distorted worldview.
 

 
...
 

 
From Han Zhi's perspective, which was unaffected by any identity card, romantic relationships were not within his realm of consideration.
 

 
As a top celebrity carrying the dreams of countless young girls, if he fell in love with someone, it would shatter the dreams of those girls. Before joining the reality show, Tong Zhao thought that his lack of romantic experience made him suitable for the task because...
 

 
He was very skilled at making others fall in love with him.
 

 
Of course, after entering the show, Han Zhi's mind had been filled with a large number of “exes” that matched his views on relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai's expression was intense and probing when he asked, not like he was playing a game.
 

 
He was very serious in his mind.
 

 
And this was also the reason why, in his past life, Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao grew further apart. Wei Zekai, who had no concept of being smooth or diplomatic, interacted with people in a very raw manner. He could turn good intentions into something annoying and bothersome. If he weren't so good-looking, he would indeed be more suited to play a comic villain in a comedy.
 

 
“Well,”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him with surprise, seemingly not expecting a man to be interested in his views on relationships.
 

 
His aesthetic preferences were only for women, but if Wei Zekai was dressed as a girl...
 

 
He imagined it in his mind and thought, it might not be so bad.
 

 
This image was vividly captured by the AI, comparable to the fantasy of Snape in a dress from the wizarding world.
 

 
The director immediately decided to include this scene in the highlight preview.
 

 
Han Zhi briefly pondered, then his lips and eyes curved into a gentle smile. Even such a playful question from a rich, rebellious young man was taken seriously by him. Everyone heard him say: “It should be about bringing happiness to those who like me. I would want her to know that in my eyes, she is unique and shining.”
 

 
He had a deep, mellow voice.
 

 
Even though he was speaking very normal things and not affecting his tone, his words seemed to penetrate the eardrums, causing a tingling sensation. The other two female guests couldn't help but have their hearts race and faces flush.
 

 
It’s not scary if a playboy is handsome; it’s frightening if a playboy is also a warm-hearted man.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao raised her hand and scratched her ear, giving him a very harsh label:
 

 
"Pure desire has become a demon, this is something else."
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately knew he was downplaying the issue.
 

 
The lie detector didn’t go off, most likely because he truly thought that way.
 

 
She had a keen eye for people, and Han Zhi was definitely not superficial.
 

 
But others didn’t see it that way.
 

 
Especially Wei Zekai—
 

 
He was moved!
 

 
How could someone with such pure thoughts possibly be a playboy?
 

 
Even if he drew the special identity card of a playboy, he surely wouldn’t harm girls!
 

 
Detective Wei Zekai first ruled out one correct answer and categorized Han Zhi into the safe group in his mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed sarcastically in her mind, not expecting that in the next round she would draw "Dare."
 

 
"Dare: Please have the 'Ghost King' and the person who drew the smallest number come to Room 2 at 8 PM tonight and mold a pair of ceramic couple cups."
 

 
He Shun immediately looked at his card.
 

 
Unfortunately, he drew a rather large number, so he had little hope.
 

 
"Ah."
 

 
The old enchantress sitting next to Tong Zhao, who was both pure and seductive, gently shook her square two cards.
# Chapter32
In the second round, Zhong Muxi drew the "Ghost" card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who drew the smallest card, didn't make things difficult for her; she just asked what Zhong Muxi's favorite food was. Zhong Muxi quietly answered "Cake," and the game continued. Compared to the handsome men and beautiful women present, no one seemed to care about her answer. It was as if, in school, she was just one of those ordinary students whom no one paid much attention to, neither bullied nor interested in.
 

 
As she spoke, Zhong Muxi's gaze was lowered.
 

 
This caused her to miss the fact that Han Zhi had been intently watching her throughout her answer.
 

 
In the next round, Wei Zekai, who drew another "Dare," had to cook a meal with Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Both of them were clueless about cooking and were instantly at a loss, while Chang Xiaonian was somewhat pleased.
 

 
These little details about the girls were fully revealed on camera.
 

 
In the third round, He Shun, who drew the "Ghost King" card, chose "Truth." Zhong Muxi impulsively asked him, "What type of girl do you like?"
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
"Probably a gentle and virtuous girl, someone more homey. I place a lot of importance on family warmth.”
 

 
He Shun was also a bit surprised but answered the straightforward question honestly.
 

 
【So this glasses-wearing girl has an interest in me too?】 He Shun's inner voice held a trace of condescension.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at the lie detector and quickly looked down.
 

 
Her hands clenched tightly under the table.
 

 
Zhong Muxi's inner thoughts were on the verge of breaking down: 【How could there be no lie? Am I not gentle or virtuous enough? Tong Zhao can't cook or wash dishes! Why lie? Why?】
 

 
……
 

 
The lighting technician was surprised: "Were Zhong Muxi and He Shun in a relationship before?"
 

 
"No, they didn’t know each other before joining the reality show. Zhong Muxi doesn't have any feelings for He Shun," the director said, showing the detected affection level. Zhong Muxi's affection for He Shun was only 30, which fell into the category of "feeling uncomfortable being alone with him in an elevator."
 

 
The scriptwriter sympathetically looked at the glasses-wearing girl on the observation screen: "Didn’t Zhong Muxi think that He Shun resembled her ex-boyfriend? Maybe she projected the same doubts. Why, even though He Shun says he likes gentle and virtuous girls, he end up showing affection to a princess-type girl who doesn't know anything?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi drew the dare card again, and her task was to watch a romantic movie with Han Zhi.
 

 
In the final round, Tong Zhao drew the ghost card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian asked her how many boyfriends she had had, with a hint of curiosity and mild jealousy in her probing.
 

 
In this reality show, Tong Zhao’s identity card indicated that she had no romantic experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao's eyes curved slightly, and a genuine smile spread across her lips.
 

 
"None."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who also had no romantic experience, looked at her with a look of approval, noting that she should be protected.
 

 
The burden on the judge's shoulders was indeed heavy.
 

 
*
 

 
The screen in the game room announced that the task was successfully completed.
 

 
Today's reward was that all players would receive a day's worth of ingredients.
 

 
Since it was only the second day, everyone was still not very familiar with each other. The two young girls stuck together like conjoined twins, while He Shun and Tong Zhao carried out the task on their identity cards—He Shun was the "teacher" and had to tutor Tong Zhao, who drew the "female student" card. Over the course of a month, there would be three tests, and failure to pass would result in penalties for both.
 

 
Although there was a study room in the estate, Tong Zhao requested to have the classes at the long table in the living room, citing He Shun’s gender as the reason.
 

 
He Shun agreed, showing no outward dissatisfaction, but felt a bit regretful inside.
 

 
The production team observed that his favorability towards Tong Zhao had increased, reaching the threshold of “not believing others' negative comments about her.”
 

 
“One moment he’s all over the place,” one female staff member said, puzzled, “He Shun wanted to be alone with Tong Zhao, but she didn’t give him that chance. He feels regretful, yet his favorability increased? Can someone explain this from a man’s perspective?”
 

 
A male screenwriter tried to relate and found he felt the same way: “Men often take advantage of any chance they get. It feels good to benefit from a girl, but they will only really like a girl who values herself and has principles… Plus, when the chance to be alone does come, it feels even more rewarding! If it were me, I’d start looking forward to the opportunity to be alone with Tong Zhao from this moment on, and would be very willing to go out of my way to win her approval.”
 

 
The lighting technician said, “Thanks, that made me feel a bit cheapened.”
 

 
Wei Zekai and Han Zhi were left alone.
 

 
Han Zhi was reading in the room, while Wei Zekai, who had been playing video games on the sofa, dozed off with his head tilted, setting an alarm for the night before he fell asleep.
 

 
After all, he had drawn the "Dare" card and had to cook dinner with Miss Chang.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite troubled.
 

 
His peak cooking skills in this lifetime were during the heyday of games like Cooking Mama and Kitchen Nightmares. His culinary prowess in the games was impressive, but in reality, he was rather clueless.
 

 
Fortunately, Tong Zhao and Han Zhi were in the same group; they were both quite straightforward, so he could relax.
 

 
Otherwise, he would really be in a bind.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was also very worried.
 

 
She thought about it and decided to consult Han Zhi, who was known for his excellent cooking. He carefully taught her two quick dishes and was even more easygoing than she had expected.
 

 
However, by the evening, Chang Xiaonian’s worries came true.
 

 
She asked Wei Zekai to assist her. He was quite obedient, rolling up his sleeves without a word and getting to work. While she handled other ingredients, she turned around to find that he had turned the onions into onion paste.
 

 
“……”
 

 
Wei Zekai's handsome eyebrows were filled with pride. “My knife skills are pretty good, right? Who wouldn’t say that’s impressive?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian opened her mouth and then, with restraint, closed it.
 

 
“I’ll handle this. You go help me cook the rice,” she instructed gently.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just tested his knife skills, found cooking somewhat interesting. He thought that such a simple task seemed beneath his talents, but given that it was a request from a girl, he decided to go to the rice cooker after washing the rice.
 

 
Wei Zekai carefully rinsed the rice.
 

 
Seeing his reliable actions, Chang Xiaonian felt a bit reassured.
 

 
When she finished preparing the dishes and went to serve the rice, she opened the lid and saw a pot of...
 

 
Stir-fried rice.
 

 
The grains were distinct, and the rice was stuck together, occasionally forming clumps, resembling cat litter.
 

 
……
 

 
“Wei Zekai,” Chang Xiaonian exclaimed in shock, “Did you cook the rice without adding water!?”
 

 
What kind of mistake is this?
 

 
Wei Zekai was even more shocked. “You have to add water when cooking rice!?”
 

 
With no other option, Chang Xiaonian had to add water and cook it again.
 

 
The rice that came out of this second cooking was wet on the outside but hard on the inside, with a very poor texture. When Wei Zekai took the first bite, he almost spit it out but managed to swallow it only because it was his own work. The others looked at Han Zhi with a hint of longing for the meals he prepared but didn’t say anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao took two bites and then put down her bowl.
 

 
The AI captured her thoughts:
 

 
[Just because there’s rice in the bowl doesn’t mean it can be called rice. This bowl should be called carbohydrates at most.]
 

 
“I’ll meet you in the pottery room at eight. I’m going to take a walk to digest,” she said, glancing down at her bowl and chopsticks with a troubled expression. Han Shun immediately offered, “Go ahead, I’ve eaten enough. I’ll wash your dishes for you.”
 

 
Such a casual offer.
 

 
To Chang Xiaonian, Han Shun had already become a complete “simp.” She couldn’t help but feel a bit of sympathy for the gentle and handsome guy who would be alone with Tong Zhao to do pottery later.
 

 
I hope that after coming out of the pottery room, there won’t be another "simp" in the manor.
 

 
But it doesn’t really matter now.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was feeling quite distressed.
 

 
She had no romantic experience, loved reading novels, and read many Taiwanese pocketbooks during school that featured stories about campus princes falling in love. After starting work, she read a lot of stories about perfect relatives slapping faces and green tea bitches, learning about human relationships from novels, with no real-life opportunity to interact with a big shot.
 

 
She joined this activity with high hopes and felt that Wei Zekai was just like the campus prince she had imagined when she arrived at the manor.
 

 
Although he had a poor attitude, was absorbed in playing games, and seemed disinterested in women, he was rich and handsome. Wasn’t he the perfect leading man?
 

 
Unexpectedly, when she finally got a chance to be alone with him, she found out—
 

 
How could this guy be so clueless?
 

 
Wasn’t a prince supposed to excel at everything effortlessly?
 

 
And it was just cooking rice!
 

 
Miss Chang looked resentfully at the sofa, only to find that the previously lounging Wei Zekai was nowhere to be seen.
 

 
---
 

 
At exactly eight o'clock, Tong Zhao pushed open the door to the pottery studio.
 

 
The walls of the studio were decorated with rows of hanging ceramic artworks. The table was equipped with a full set of pottery tools, and the pottery wheel was small and delicate. Han Zhi was already seated, glancing over at her with evident anticipation. The bright light in the room and his gaze created a relaxing and comforting atmosphere.
 

 
He was the kind of man who made it easy to let down one's guard.
 

 
"Have you been here long?" she asked.
 

 
"Just arrived," he said. "I wanted to see if there were any tutorials. I’ve already learned a bit of the basics," Han Zhi arranged the tools neatly like little soldiers and motioned for her to sit beside him. "It’s a bit challenging, but it’s quite fun, like playing with mud..."
 

 
As he spoke, he chuckled, "Because it is like playing with mud."
 

 
Preparing for a date in advance was already a step ahead of many other men.
 

 
What was even more impressive was how natural he made it seem, not treating it as an achievement to boast about but as a thoughtful gesture subtly integrated into the experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a seat beside him and then noticed him magically pull out a thermal box from beside the stool and push it in front of her. Inside the box was a sandwich with egg salad. "I made some extra for myself after dinner, and since you didn’t seem to have a good meal, I made a bit more. If you don’t mind, you can have some to fill your stomach.”
 

 
---
 

 
"Thank you. I really didn’t eat well; that meal was hard to describe."
 

 
She complained in a spoiled tone, like a young lady who felt entitled.
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up the sandwich and began to eat. The white toast was lightly toasted and still warm, likely made not long before.
 

 
While she ate, Han Zhi looked away and drew a cute chibi bunny in his sketchbook.
 

 
Tong Zhao, curious, asked, "Can you draw?"
 

 
"I was just looking at a tutorial that said pottery doesn't have to be about making cups; you can also make figurines. The coloring tools here are quite complete," Han Zhi said with a smile. "I didn’t know what to make at first, but when I saw you eating, I thought of making a bunny."
 

 
Tong Zhao, munching on her sandwich, paused and asked, "Do I look like a bunny?"
 

 
Han Zhi, though young and dressed neatly, had an inexplicable air of weariness about him, as if he had experienced many things and returned with a calm and gentle demeanor. It felt like if you threw a tantrum in front of him, you would only receive a tolerant look.
 

 
Such a man would be classified as an “older man” in books targeted at middle school students—
 

 
---
 

 
In romance novels, the male lead is often considered youthful, and by the age of twenty-eight, he's already called "uncle," akin to a twenty-three-year-old eSports veteran.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Han Zhi, for the first time since Tong Zhao entered, stared at her intently.
 

 
Though he only maintained his gaze for about five seconds before looking away.
 

 
"It shouldn’t be like that; I just suddenly thought of it."
 

 
---
 

 
This was different from the initial expectations of the show’s crew regarding the "player" scenario.
 

 
Han Zhi, holding the "Writer" identity card, didn’t say any elaborate romantic lines to her. Even now, he didn't climb the ladder to praise her for being as cute as a bunny.
 

 
The production assistant pondered, "Even if Han Zhi is a top-notch handsome guy, pretending to genuinely praise a girl he just met as being like a little bunny… that’s pretty cringy! I’d rather he stayed silent and be a mute handsome guy!"
 

 
The men in the crew didn't understand.
 

 
Women’s definitions of what is cringy are indeed hard to grasp.
 

 
Yet, Han Zhi managed to control that line perfectly.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished the sandwich, the large screen in the ceramics studio displayed the task requirements for completing the adventure: “Create three beginner-level ceramic pieces, one of which must be a joint effort.”
 

 
Han Zhi interpreted it: “So, we each make one ceramic figure, and then we collaborate on one to complete the task.”
 

 
“That’s about the idea.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a tissue to wipe her hands and began to sculpt a ceramic figure under Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
Though Han Zhi claimed to only know a little, his actual handling of the task was like that of a teacher.
 

 
He could answer any questions Tong Zhao had immediately.
 

 
He was extremely skilled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him skeptically: “Is this really your first time doing ceramics?”
 

 
“Mm.”
 

 
Han Zhi answered, and just as Tong Zhao thought he would keep up the pretense, he suddenly revealed a refined and subtle smile: “This kind of thing… At the beginning, when you bring a girl along, it might seem like you’re trying to hold her hand, which is too obvious. By the time the relationship progresses to that stage, it becomes cliché.”
 

 
His deep voice echoed in the quiet ceramics studio, like a sudden thunderclap.
 

 
Tong Zhao's breath caught slightly, and her heartbeat quickened.
 

 
She pondered: *Is he revealing his true self so quickly?*
 

 
Normal romantic interactions often develop gradually, and the excitement comes from less experience.
 

 
Even holding hands can make someone anxious throughout an entire movie.
 

 
For an experienced person, holding hands and whispering during a movie is quite natural. It’s either enjoyed together or, for a novice, a nervous attempt at routines they’ve seen done many times before. Excitement has a threshold, similar to how readers felt about time-travel novels when they first became popular. Authors could spend an entire chapter discussing life before the time travel and the reasons behind it, as there was still novelty.
 

 
Later on?
 

 
With ten, a hundred, or even thousands of time-travel and reverse time-travel novels…
 

 
The result is that readers become numb. Numbness aside, they still read. Just as with a sea king’s romantic embraces, even if many have experienced similar things, it doesn’t stop the action—it just isn’t as exciting anymore.
 

 
So, skip the guessing phase and get straight to the point.
 

 
To evoke romantic feelings in front of an experienced person, one must rely on surprise—
 

 
Han Zhi initiated the advance.
 

 
“So if you wanted to hold her hand, how would you do it?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t look at him, seemingly focused and interested as she molded the clay in her hands.
 

 
But she felt his gaze on her hands.
 

 
Her delicate, fair hands looked like snow against the clay.
 

 
“If you want to shape it like an ear, you’re doing it wrong,”
 

 
Han Zhi leaned closer, his lips near her ear. He reached out to correct the clay doll’s ear, his large, defined hand close to hers but deliberately avoiding direct contact.
 

 
He smiled and asked, “I’m also struggling with this issue. How about you teach me?”
 

 
His deep voice carried a hint of laughter, with a languid undertone of unspoken desire.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but lift her eyes to glance at him, as if she had misheard his leading question. Under the bright lights, his demeanor was calm and composed, yet an ambiguous tension lingered between them, a distance close enough that one could easily pull the other into an embrace.
 

 
First, she steered the conversation back to a more serious topic, and once the distance was closed, she maintained a serious demeanor.
 

 
As she began to imagine, he provided further subtle cues for continued flirtation…
 

 
In terms of pure desire, Han Zhi was indeed a master.
 

 
What was he troubled by?
 

 
Whether it was about how to hold a girl’s hand or how to mold clay?
 

 
Tong Zhao, stirred by his teasing, took his hand in hers.
 

 
“Do I really need to teach you this too?”
 

 
She looked up at him, her pale eyes filled with irritation from being teased, making her look particularly fierce—different types of men have corresponding strategies, and in Tong Zhao’s eyes, both Han and the current flirt were in need of discipline and correction. The difference was that pretending to be innocent with Han Zhi was useless; a harsh approach was needed for a seasoned flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao curled her lips into a cold smile and spoke in a soft, seductive tone, “Zhi-ge.”
 

 
These two words seemed to have magic. After she spoke them, both "sea kings" were momentarily stunned.
 

 
He felt that this term of address seemed strangely familiar…
 

 
In a moment of relaxation from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao took the opportunity to assert herself. She smeared the clay-covered hand across his exquisitely handsome face and teased, “The only thing about me that resembles a rabbit is that I’m particularly capable. Aren’t you curious to try it?”
 

 
As soon as she said this, she pulled back, clearly indicating she was just teasing and ready to leave.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly reacted and grabbed her wrist to hold her in place.
 

 
Facing Tong Zhao's fierce gaze, Han Zhi’s heart raced even faster than before—
 

 
He wasn’t mistaken; Tong Zhao was indeed not the innocent, delicate flower she appeared to be. Her true nature was that of a domineering, arrogant beauty, and her inherent beauty carried a strong aggressive force when revealed.
 

 
This was also related to the era’s background.
 

 
In the feudal era, the Imperial Concubine Chen was like a red silk sleeve tied around the emperor’s neck—a kind of dominance that was still soft and charming. The emperor’s emotions were under her control. Without the emperor's authority to suppress her, the Imperial Concubine Chen’s imposing presence felt as though she might stomp on his face with her high heels at any moment.
 

 
Han Zhi’s gaze lingered on her rosy lips, his heart stirred deeply.
 

 
“Why? Not letting go?”
 

 
Tong Zhao squinted, ready to turn hostile at any moment.
 

 
“Not really willing to let go.”
 

 
Han Zhi admitted candidly, and in the next instant, he decided on his strategy. His poetic features took on a vulnerable expression, his aura softening to appear harmless, like a gentle teacher. Before releasing her wrist, he leaned in and brushed his face against the small patch of skin she had smeared with clay.
 

 
Then, he let go of her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s pupils widened slightly in surprise. The unexpected touch had startled her, but her agitation calmed down… She tilted her head, using the back of her hand to wipe the clay off her cheek while scrutinizing Han Zhi.
 

 
He still looked obedient.
 

 
Just moments ago, they had almost crossed a line.
 

 
From boiling to cooling down, it only took a thought.
 

 
After a brief pause, she curved her lips into a playful smile and complimented him, “Quick reaction—knows that I’m more responsive to gentleness than to force.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback by the praise, revealing a hesitant expression as if he had hit a sensitive spot.
 

 
“Don’t,”
 

 
Han Zhi’s eyes crinkled with a spring-like smile, “I can be quite assertive too.”
 

 
“Forget it,” Tong Zhao sneered, diving back into her pottery project with much more force, making it seem like she was trying to crush the fox doll’s head: “Do you think I’m like Chang Xiaonian? Someone who likes domineering CEOs?”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t respond.
 

 
He wouldn’t criticize another girl in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
“I get irritated when I see men showing off in front of me. Damn it, I can’t stand pretentious people,” Tong Zhao roughly shaped a crude fox doll. Her craftsmanship had always been average; previously, the pouches she made for the emperor were all done by palace maids. She was more like a project manager. After finishing the doll, she added, “Oh, except for myself.”
 

 
Han Zhi listened quietly while finishing his own piece.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at his wheel and noticed a bunny doll with a puffed-out face, much more delicate and beautiful than hers. She raised an eyebrow, “Is this how you see me?”
 

 
“Temporarily, yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi met her gaze calmly, not planning to back down this time.
 

 
[I’ve realized, this is a particularly difficult woman.]
 

 
[Being too domineering and tough won’t work; she’ll turn hostile. Acting meek and weak will just get her to look down on you. Objectively, apart from her top-notch beauty, she has many annoying personality traits. In front of someone like He Shun, she still has the interest to put on a show, but it won’t last long. Once the other person falls deeply in love with her, her true nature will be revealed.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed with a detached mindset.
 

 
---
 

 
In the production team:
 

 
The lighting technician clicked his tongue in amazement: “From Han Zhi’s inner monologue, it looks like he and Tong Zhao have no chemistry at all?”
 

 
The scriptwriter gave him a look: “It’s obvious he hasn’t been in a relationship. The sexual tension between them is so strong that I suspect if it weren’t for the restriction on explicit content... but then again, considering Han Zhi’s true identity, it’s a bit complicated.”
 

 
---
 

 
[Cynical, domineering, capricious, self-important...]
 

 
[If we were to sketch her personality, Tong Zhao would certainly be full of flaws.]
 

 
Han Zhi thought, giving her a provocative smile: “If you don’t want to be a prickly little bunny, then show me your other strengths.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him with curiosity, thinking he was a master of adaptation, and quite a cunning old fox.
 

 
[Let me see what other tricks you have—]
 

 
With this passionate thought, she grabbed his arm and pulled him towards her, kissing his lips forcefully.
 

 
Tong Zhao's actions were so intense that they knocked over the recently made ceramic figures.
 

 
The ugly fox was pinned down by the aggressive rabbit on the table and couldn't get up.
# Chapter33
"Congratulations to both of you for completing the adventure task!"
 

 
After these words appeared on the electronic screen in the ceramic studio, they heard two beeps, and the previously locked door automatically opened. Tong Zhao placed the two ceramic figures on the shelf, deliberately keeping them far apart from Han Zhi's work—
 

 
It’s not about not knowing the goods, but fearing the comparison.
 

 
Even someone as proud as Tong Zhao had to admit that her ceramic fox was poorly made.
 

 
Han Zhi asked, "Why place them so far apart?"
 

 
"Don't you have any discernment? Seems I overestimated your emotional intelligence."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled, and after tidying up the tools, he moved next to Tong Zhao and took the liberty of placing the two figures, which were originally far apart, facing each other, as if the little fox was bowing to kiss the rabbit.
 

 
Tong Zhao expressionlessly took the ceramic cups they had made together and turned them upside down over the two ceramic figures, covering them completely.
 

 
To anyone looking at the shelf, it would only appear as an overturned ceramic cup.
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned, then laughed, "A bit envious—they get to do things that can't be seen by others."
 

 
...
 

 
What are you saying, you old pervert!
 

 
Tong Zhao was surprised and gave him a look.
 

 
Just a moment ago in the ceramic studio, she had kissed him non-stop, making his pale lips redden, and now there was still a trace of that red. Tong Zhao chuckled, "You’re going to watch a movie with glasses girl later, right? Remember to wipe off the lipstick on your mouth. Women are very sensitive to colors; she’s been watching me closely and has a visual memory of the lipstick I use."
 

 
It's also strange.
 

 
Zhong Muxi seemed to pay more attention to her interactions with He Shun than to Han Zhi.
 

 
"Don't wipe it off. It looks good," Han Zhi said casually, as if he didn’t care.
 

 
Going to a movie with another girl while sporting a woman’s lipstick marks?
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but pinch his cheek, "Where did you come from, you trendy non-mainstream guy?"
 

 
"Then help me apply it more evenly.”
 

 
Han Zhi took the opportunity to lower his head and kiss her lips. Tong Zhao, still wanting to speak, found her tongue gently claimed by his, like a fox nibbling at a fish cheek, tenderly swirling around. They didn’t close their eyes, almost falling into the depths of each other’s gaze. The kiss was passionate, yet their physical actions remained restrained—no embraces, no crossing lines, which made one relax involuntarily.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t stand his ease and bit his tongue lightly.
 

 
When he released her, the lipstick marks on his lips were indeed blended naturally.
 

 
"See, it’s all good now."
 

 
Han Zhi lazily squeezed her hand before letting go.
 

 
"Nice technique. Let’s continue next time."
 

 
Han Zhi put his hands in his pockets. "I’m already looking forward to it."
 

 
Tong Zhao stuck out her tongue at him with a victorious grin and turned to leave. After she left, Han Zhi headed toward the kitchen on the first floor. Only half an hour remained before their scheduled 10 p.m. movie date, and he didn’t have much time left.
 

 
*
 

 
There was a mini-theater in the basement of the estate.
 

 
The entire wall was covered with a screen and a projector, with walls on either side filled with film options. These packaged film rights were cheap, but to save even more money, the "Aquaman Kill" program had filled it with old, outdated movies.
 

 
Zhong Muxi arrived early, wandering in the corridor outside the basement entrance twenty minutes ahead of time, pacing back and forth like a ghost.
 

 
She was so nervous just thinking about watching a movie with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
When Han Zhi arrived, he happened to see the bespectacled girl peeking around.
 

 
As their eyes met, Zhong Muxi froze completely.
 

 
She lowered her gaze, avoiding eye contact, clutching her skirt with a sense of self-consciousness.
 

 
Han Zhi acted as if he didn’t notice her awkward and distant behavior and approached with a smile, inviting her, “Shall we go in together?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi responded with a soft "mm," keeping her head down as she entered the mini-theater.
 

 
After they walked in, the door behind them was locked with a beep.
 

 
Zhong Muxi shivered slightly.
 

 
“No need to be nervous. The lock will open once the adventure task is completed,” Han Zhi explained casually, looking around the theater. “The restroom is right next to the screen.”
 

 
“Oh, I’m not nervous,”
 

 
Zhong Muxi attempted to joke, “I look so harmless, there’s no need to worry.”
 

 
It’s actually Han Zhi, a handsome guy like him, who should be worried about his personal safety!
 

 
Han Zhi, fiddling with the projection equipment, didn’t turn around and replied casually, “You’re saying that because you’re nervous. Don’t worry, I’ve prepared some things to help ease your nerves.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
Han Zhi had selected a few movies he had seen and thought were good for her to choose from. After checking the running times, she picked the shortest one.
 

 
After the movie started, Han Zhi sat down in the seat next to hers, leaving one seat in between.
 

 
This action made Zhong Muxi, who hadn’t had high expectations to begin with, display a moment of embarrassment. It was quickly hidden by her glasses, but she could already foresee how difficult the next hour would be. The thoughts AI captured were like spilled black mud…
 

 
[“I’m sorry, I didn’t want to draw this either. It would be much more enjoyable to watch a movie with someone like Tong Zhao or Xiao Nian, who are cheerful, beautiful, and cute. I shouldn’t even be here; I can’t even have a proper conversation, and I can’t even manage to be a good companion for watching a movie and joking around. I can only awkwardly lower my head, trying to lighten the mood with a joke, but it ends up being neither funny nor timely.”]
 

 
“You can’t watch a movie without this.”
 

 
Han Zhi magically pulled out a large bowl of caramel popcorn, wrapped in plastic wrap, and a serving of soufflé in an insulated box from his backpack, placing them on the seat between them.
 

 
There was only one serving.
 

 
“You mentioned you like cake during Truth or Dare, but there was no time to make a proper cake. I’m afraid this will have to do,” Han Zhi said, unwrapping the plastic wrap, and grabbing a handful of popcorn while watching the screen. The caramel was homemade and still gave off a rich, sweet aroma even after it had set.
 

 
“Oh, right, there’s a spoon too.”
 

 
Han Zhi, as if remembering it belatedly, took out a silver spoon from a cutlery box in his backpack and handed it to the dazed Zhong Muxi before continuing to watch the movie.
 

 
By the time Zhong Muxi realized it, she was already eating the soufflé.
 

 
The sweet, soft taste spread across her lips and tongue, effectively easing her nervousness. Throughout, Han Zhi didn’t turn to look at her, giving her plenty of time to adjust.
 

 
Although he didn’t look at her, Han Zhi was mentally profiling her:
 

 
[This type of girl can be pressured. If you’re a bit tougher with her, she’ll listen. She’ll just think she’s not doing well enough and will follow her boyfriend’s commands in her anxiety... That doesn’t fit my aesthetic; it feels low-grade.]
 

 
[Zhong Muxi is like a flower encased in ice. If you smash it onto the ground, the ice won’t protect the flower. If the goal is just to get the flower, it doesn’t matter how many petals break. But you could also choose to melt the ice with warm water, so the flower remains unharmed.]
 

 
Han Zhi chose a good movie.
 

 
He shared his thoughts with her intermittently.
 

 
Gradually, Zhong Muxi began to respond to him, becoming more relaxed as she spoke.
 

 
As they talked, she confessed, “I’m really sorry. It’s probably better to watch a movie with any other girl than with me.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was accustomed to seeing herself as a joke.
 

 
Now that she was so relaxed, her words carried a hint of sadness and apology.
 

 
Zhong Muxi felt that her mediocrity was a disservice to Han Zhi.
 

 
Her current self-doubt made her feel deeply apologetic towards herself.
 

 
Han Zhi paused. Turning his head from the screen, he gazed steadily at her:
 

 
“I enjoy watching movies with you. It’s rude to compare you with others,” he said, his tone softening as if he realized his previous words were too harsh. He lowered his eyelashes, speaking in a voice as gentle and soothing as if comforting a child, making her eyes well up: “Even though you might not see me as a potential romantic interest, please don’t bring up other people when we’re watching a movie together, okay?”
 

 
Previously, Han Zhi had deliberately avoided eye contact, minimizing his presence.
 

 
Now, their eyes met suddenly, and his movie-star-level face filled Zhong Muxi’s entire vision. She stared at him, only hearing the sound of her own heart pounding—because of his previous understated and subtle approach, this direct and heartfelt statement was all the more stunning and impactful.
 

 
Who could resist a handsome guy speaking romantic words?
 

 
Zhong Muxi's tongue twisted, and after obediently agreeing, she could no longer focus on the movie.
 

 
Because she realized…
 

 
In Han Zhi’s eyes, she didn’t seem very “safe” either.
 

 
This realization made her a bit happy, as if, due to his special attention, she was once again classified as a “girl.”
 

 
After that, Han Zhi didn’t say much more, and their conversation remained solely about the movie.
 

 
After the movie ended, he escorted Zhong Muxi back to her bedroom door and left.
 

 
His gentlemanly manners were taken for granted.
 

 
What kind of playboy do people imagine?
 

 
A whirlwind of romance, the kind of romantic gestures that dull, straightforward men couldn’t conceive… Han Zhi could achieve that. But rather than simply breaking through defenses, his interest had shifted. He hoped the young girl could rediscover herself by falling for him. He moved slowly, relaxed, and left ample space for poetic imagination, aiming to revive the once stagnant heart that had become a dead pool in the mundane and ordinary life.
 

 
The excitement was the first gift he gave to the glasses-wearing girl.
 

 
---
 

 
That night, after falling asleep, everyone woke up in the holographic filming pod.
 

 
Under the intense variety show shooting schedule, guests must complete the legally mandated amount of exercise during their limited waking hours before they can continue with the filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao rubbed her dizzy head and went to the gym to do warm-up exercises and run.
 

 
She happened to run into the director, who came to check on everyone.
 

 
"The first episode will air soon. I can’t wait to see the audience’s reaction," the director said. Noticing her indifferent expression, he remembered, "Ah, your memory from the variety show hasn't returned yet, right? Don’t worry, your performance as both yourself and your other self was great. All the girls in our production team are completely captivated by Han Zhi."
 

 
"Thank you, director."
 

 
Tong Zhao thanked him.
 

 
She wasn’t surprised at all.
 

 
"But the others still don’t know that a guest is missing. For the sake of the show, please keep it confidential for now. We plan to reveal Han Zhi’s identity only after the entire season airs," the director said in a lower voice.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the director happily greeted the other guests who were arriving at the gym.
 

 
Duan Ge: [What did Han Zhi do on the show?]
 

 
Han Zhi: [I can’t remember at the moment.]
 

 
[I’m also quite curious,] the gentle voice of the Imperial Concubine Chen said with a hint of annoyance, [You must have done something to me on the variety show. I’m a bit irritated whenever I see you now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Maybe he did.]
 

 
Duan Ge & Han Zhi & Imperial Concubine Chen: [?]
 

 
……
 

 
The pre-launch activities were well done, and with anticipation all over the internet, the first episode of “Sea King Killer” is about to air.
 

 
In the pre-show clips, one of them features a solo performance by the mysterious amateur male guest, Han Zhi.
 

 
BGM: “He Was Just Passing By”
 

 
The footage, from the tired glance upon entering the estate to his silent self-introduction, exclusively features shots where he is not smiling. It must be said, while his warm guy style is quite charming, the mysterious and cool image of him in the edits arouses even more curiosity among female netizens.
 

 
— “Sorry, I’m a bit late,”
 

 
— “Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ for persistence.”
 

 
The background music reaches the chorus part with the lyrics “Everything is just brushed over…” and the beat, showing his dangerous and sexy side in front of Tong Zhao. It freezes at the moment their lips are about to touch and, just as viewers' emotions and curiosity are at their peak, the screen abruptly turns black, quickly displaying the program's official broadcast time.
 

 
This face, once conquering another world and becoming a top Eastern star, is now recreated in holographic virtual reality!
# Chapter34
Beauty is hard currency.
 

 
A face so handsome that it makes the audience gasp has a promotional effect all on its own.
 

 
The production team of the show "King of the Sea" has clipped many solo segments of Wei Zekai and Han Zhi, using them for pre-release promotion on major short video apps and Weibo. The young master, with his short hair highlighted in gold and brown, looks as aloof and proud as a cat, attracting a lot of older sister and mom fans who just want to pull this big boy into their arms and pat his head.
 

 
Han Zhi has the purest form of high-level looks and a strong presence.
 

 
Many netizens were shocked—
 

 
In an era of information explosion, no handsome man or beautiful woman goes unnoticed. As long as someone is good-looking enough, they can instantly become popular, even if they just appear on "1818 Golden Eye." However, with Han Zhi, they truly know nothing about him. New threads keep popping up on entertainment forums, yet apart from screenshots admiring his looks, there is no other information at all.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
This isn't just some average-looking guy on the street.
 

 
Han Zhi's face, as captured on camera, is filled with a star-like quality and a strong presence. Even when he first appeared exhausted, with water droplets clinging to his hair, it didn't diminish his dazzling aura in the slightest. He gave the entrance hall the feel of a runway show.
 

 
How could he possibly be a nobody?
 

 
Netizens began to discuss, and the search terms related to "Han Zhi" kept rising. Even those who do not follow the entertainment industry would be intrigued by posts on their Weibo homepage such as [Ahhh, I need to know everything about Han Zhi within three seconds!], [This batch of netizens is useless; it’s been an entire afternoon, and they’ve only managed to dig out Han Zhi’s name!], and [Waiting eagerly for tonight’s premiere of "King of the Sea"!]...
 

 
These kinds of posts have piqued people's interest in Han Zhi and the variety show.
 

 
At this moment, the entire Eastern internet is filled with curiosity about Han Zhi.
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans are also passionately speaking up, but their voices are quite divided.
 

 
[Ahhhh, she should never have gone on a dating variety show, TVT! Manager, come out and die!]
 

 
[Where did this pretty boy come from? Stay away from my Zhao Zhao!]
 

 
These are the "boyfriend fans" who are losing it on the spot.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who played a noble concubine overflowing with femininity, attracted a group of fans who adored her looks. They are quite resistant to her starring in a "strong female lead" movie like *Countdown: 72 Hours*, hoping she would continue down the path of playing charming, seductive women. But instead of getting what they were waiting for, they saw their goddess getting close to another handsome guy on a variety show—how could they not be devastated?
 

 
However, in an era where instinctual variety shows are rampant, this isn't uncommon.
 

 
What happens on these instinct-driven variety shows cannot be taken completely at face value.
 

 
So, most male fans remain steadfast: [As long as they don’t officially announce they're together after the show, she’s still my good wife. Enough said, I forgive you. *[insert meme of wearing a green hat]*.]
 

 
While the male fans are going crazy, the female fans are much more composed.
 

 
[I think this handsome guy and Zhao are quite a good match.]
 

 
[Wait a minute, I remember the rich second-generation heir on the show and the concubine are also good friends. A love triangle is in the works?]
 

 
[If you guys keep talking about this, I won't be sleepy anymore!]
 

 
Whether male or female fans, they at least have some vested interest in this.
 

 
The most pitiful one, however, is Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The top comment under this trailer's hot discussion tagged this poor "Emperor":
 

 
[Are you even human if you tag Song Wanzhuo after seeing the concubine kissing someone else? I already told you not to tag Song Wanzhuo, so why are you still tagging him? How do you think Song Wanzhuo would feel seeing this?]
 

 
Just as netizens were passionately discussing Han Zhi's divine looks, they suddenly remembered that in *Legend of Emperor Ming*, Song Wanzhuo's feelings toward Tong Zhao were rather unusual. Given that it was an instinct-driven drama, it's impossible to say he didn't feel anything at all. However, the two of them cut ties after filming, so this CP (couple pairing) didn’t really gain much traction.
 

 
But when this was brought up, the main person involved actually replied.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo: [Haha, my heart feels not the slightest ripple, and I’ll be watching the first episode tonight.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, here comes the muddle-headed emperor!]
 

 
[Dream crossover/dog head meme]
 

 
From the bottom of his heart, Song Wanzhuo genuinely believed that watching this variety show wouldn’t stir any emotional waves in him.
 

 
What he loved was the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming*, not Tong Zhao herself. Once the drama was over, the feeling wasn't quite the same. However, he does plan to watch the variety show *King of the Sea*, because he really likes Tong Zhao's looks. Like some male fans who adore delicate beauties, he also hopes Zhao Zhao will always remain beautiful, avoiding roles like Feng Yanqi’s, where she plays a fierce and dominant character...
 

 
In short, he’s confident and staying calm.
 

 
The appearance of the "Dog Emperor" (referring to Song Wanzhuo) turned the previously tense atmosphere into a sea of joyful banter and memes.
 

 
The first episode of *King of the Sea* premiered right on time.
 

 
The holographic screening rooms and online cinemas were packed with viewers.
 

 
Some audience members already had Tong Zhao's fan badge displayed next to their IDs, silently making their presence known.
 

 
For the audience, the introduction of the three ordinary participants felt like filler time, and they chatted and joked around in the bullet comments, not taking it seriously. The production team knew how important the beginning was, so they didn’t give them much screen time; after a brief introduction, the progress bar quickly moved to Wei Zekai’s entrance.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound effects of jingling coins, Young Master Wei stepped out of a luxury car.
 

 
A single line, "Is this it?" made the number of bullet comments surge.
 

 
When he later referred to the large room the guests were supposed to sleep in as "a worker's room," the audience couldn't help but sigh that they were not living in the same world as this young master. If this is considered a "worker's room" in the Wei family, how big and luxurious must the room he actually sleeps in be?
 

 
[This second-generation rich kid is too vivid, he's basically playing himself.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai, debut now! If you don’t get famous, you can always go back to your family’s billion-dollar business. *dog head meme*]
 

 
[Boohoo, that single "Is this it?" broke me, especially while I’m still paying off my mortgage.]
 

 
Some bullet comments explaining the background of Wei Zekai's wealthy family to viewers who were not in the know.
 

 
The thrill brought by the rich, handsome young man sustained the audience’s interest for a while longer.
 

 
However, the audience’s biggest excitement was still about when Han Zhi and Tong Zhao would make their appearances.
 

 
The waiting time for the guests was fast-forwarded at double speed, with a shortcut inserted of Young Master Wei playing a game. After losing three rounds in a row, he irritably spent four sets of 648 yuan on *Honor of Kings* and mumbled under his breath, "Spending money for good karma, hurry up and give me some decent teammates."
 

 
Until night fell, the manor outside was shrouded in a torrential downpour.
 

 
At this point, the editors skillfully played the horror movie soundtrack, as if this sweet dating show was about to turn into a murder mystery in a locked room. In this tense atmosphere of impending storm, there was a commotion at the door. Everyone turned to look—it was the much-anticipated appearance of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was her first time appearing on screen in a sweet and charming modern style.
 

 
Tong Zhao has been in the limelight recently, and it's about time the audience got used to her beauty.
 

 
But when she appeared in a pure white little dress, the director proudly gave her several close-up shots. Her slender and graceful figure was accentuated by the fitted waist design, creating beautiful curves. The combination of white socks and leather shoes added a touch of cute innocence—every aspect was soft and delicate...
 

 
The audience suddenly realized they still weren't tired of seeing this face.
 

 
Facing the gazes of the other guests, especially the dissatisfied look from Young Master Wei directed at the latecomer, she gave a slight apologetic smile. Her light-colored eyes were filled with a deer-like sense of panic and innocence—so pure, so delicate.
 

 
The bullet comments exploded instantly.
 

 
For a moment, it was a celebration by Tong Zhao’s fans who adored her looks—
 

 
[Ahhhhh, I love this look so much! Give the stylist a full banquet!]
 

 
[Sweet and soft little Loli, I’m in love! I declare that from now on, I’m a dad fan of Zhao Bao! *heart emoji*]
 

 
[Wait a minute, so my wife is going to kiss other men while looking this cute?]
 

 
A quick-handed fan excitedly swapped Tong Zhao’s innocent expression from her entrance onto the body of Yao, the Deer Spirit hero from *Honor of Kings*, and found it to be a perfect match—it was as if she was the real Yao Princess.
 

 
Before the “face-licking” fans could settle down, the narrator introduced the identity card Tong Zhao had drawn for the variety show—
 

 
["The King of the Sea" – "Female Student" Tong Zhao: It's often said that women are made of water, and she is certainly the sweetest femme fatale. Skilled at disguising herself, she can transform into any appearance you desire, like a black lotus flower drifting among men. At school, instead of focusing on credits and exam rankings, the male classmates care more about where they stand in Tong Zhao's heart. To win the top spot, they do everything they can to shower her with attention...]
 

 
[Can Tong Zhao achieve her goal, win this competition, and secure the prize money to treat her critically ill family member?]
 

 
The camera freezes right on the look in her eyes as she gazes at the male guests on set.
 

 
Hidden within is a desire to conquer.
 

 
...
 

 
Ah, Princess Zhao Zhao truly is a "black lotus."
 

 
At this moment, fans who started following her because of *Legend of Emperor Ming* went wild with excitement.
 

 
They love this kind of character setting so much!
 

 
Everyone is quite delighted.
 

 
Especially for Song Wanzhuo, who was watching in the holographic screening room, he was astonished to discover that when he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*, his once lifeless heart seemed to be called back to life, beating wildly—
 

 
What is this...
 

 
Is this the feeling of being moved?
 

 
It was clearly the same person, the same face, but when he met Tong Zhao in private, apart from appreciating her beauty, he never had this kind of heart-pounding feeling.
 

 
While confused, Song Wanzhuo was even more overjoyed.
 

 
It was like seeing his idol make a comeback.
 

 
He thought he would spend the rest of his life only watching edited clips of the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming* to get his “sugar rush,” but unexpectedly, he found that same feeling again in *King of the Sea*. Even though he couldn't figure out why, he couldn’t help but post on Weibo.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo:
 

 
Haha, my youth is back!
 

 
Although he didn’t explicitly say what he was referring to, considering he had mentioned earlier in the day that he was going to watch *King of the Sea*, and this happened to coincide with the time just after Tong Zhao's appearance, fans and onlookers immediately guessed that he was quite fond of Tong Zhao's new look this time. Ever since finishing *Legend of Emperor Ming*, he had gradually transitioned from being an idol to purely being an instinct-driven actor, and this kind of comment was still within his fans' tolerance range...
 

 
After all, there really wasn't any concrete evidence about the two of them.
 

 
Not even staged interactions for publicity; it was clear they were just a "plastic couple" who went their separate ways after filming.
 

 
However, the comments from female fans below his post were tinged with jealousy, gently reminding him—
 

 
[Brother, don’t go crazy. Think about the preview content.]
 

 
[Brother Wanzhuo’s reaction is exactly like a boyfriend fan from our fandom.] This comment was from a fan of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some more mischievous and sarcastic netizens gave him a blunt reminder: [Your Majesty, your beloved concubine is about to date another man!]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was happily watching the variety show when he saw this highly upvoted comment from a random viewer, and his smile instantly froze on his face.
 

 
Just then, Han Zhi made his appearance in *King of the Sea*.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was watching with bullet comments turned on.
 

 
As soon as Han Zhi appeared, aside from the excited shrieks from fans admiring his looks, there were a bunch of green bullet comments playing on a meme:
 

 
[Hats are being handed out, everyone, put them on in advance.]
 

 
What made things worse was that Song Wanzhuo’s earlier Weibo post had made it to the lower end of the trending list and was being reposted by numerous marketing accounts with laughter, which then synced up with the bullet comments from those watching at the same time—
 

 
[Dog Emperor, I know you’re watching. Make sure to keep your hat on.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s mindset instantly shattered.
# Chapter35
Song Wanzhuo used to be a skeptic about love developing from working together.
 

 
Although it's not uncommon for people to be influenced by in-movie emotions, he was known in the industry as a staunchly straight man, famously indifferent to romantic scenes. Even after filming *Legend of Emperor Ming* and clearing his reputation, he felt no flutter in his heart when meeting Tong Zhao in person...
 

 
So, he became a fan of Tong Zhao’s looks.
 

 
A very pure fan of her looks.
 

 
Unlike those boyfriend fans who call Tong Zhao their "wife," he was very noble.
 

 
Until he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*...
 

 
Forget about calling her "wife"—she was his beloved concubine QAQ!
 

 
In the past, during promotional events and movie screenings, he had plenty of opportunities to see her. Tong Zhao gave Song Wanzhuo the impression of a slightly aloof but polite beauty. Working with her was very pleasant, but no romantic sparks flew. As a hidden fan of her looks, it was perfectly normal for him to admire her beauty...
 

 
But at that moment, Song Wanzhuo realized his pure admiration had transformed.
 

 
He instantly upgraded from a fan of her looks to a boyfriend fan.
 

 
If it weren’t for the paparazzi discovering him and causing trouble for Tong Zhao, he would really want to change his phone's wallpaper to a picture of his beloved. Song Wanzhuo, thinking this way, casually took a few screenshots of Tong Zhao. His beloved concubine truly passed the test from every angle with her breathtaking beauty!
 

 
Her unedited photos are stunning!
 

 
A beauty in a golden age!
 

 
Remembering that this is a month-long dating show, Song Wanzhuo felt both envious and regretful.
 

 
If he had known earlier, he would have squeezed in time to join the show, even for free. Living with his beloved concubine—could it be called a loss? Probably not. The only issue might be that his manager would tear him apart. Moreover, *King of the Sea* wasn’t well-known before the trailer went viral. From any angle, it was unlikely he would be on the show.
 

 
Logically, Song Wanzhuo thought this way.
 

 
But emotionally...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s fingers flew across the screen, crazily posting in the bullet comments:
 

 
[I also want to help Zhao Zhao move her luggage!]
 

 
[Help! What an unbelievably cute profile, Zhao Zhao, please start dating me immediately!]
 

 
[Can’t understand what He Shun can do that I can’t. How can someone who helps her move her luggage not be me?]
 

 
You can’t imagine the happiness of being a boyfriend fan!
 

 
For Song Wanzhuo, who had just been promoted to a boyfriend fan, his happiness lasted less than five minutes.
 

 
To keep the show’s pace tight, after Tong Zhao went upstairs to freshen up, the show quickly moved on to Han Zhi’s appearance.
 

 
At this moment, VIP viewers with special privileges were even sending animated emojis.
 

 
What kind of animation?
 

 
It was the scene where Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were about to kiss.
 

 
In other words, Dog Emperor experienced everything from falling in love to heartbreak in just four and a half minutes, with a hint of being cuckolded, enriching his life experience all at once.
 

 
To make matters worse, as Tong Zhao finished freshening up and walked out of her room in slippers, she made eye contact with Han Zhi.
 

 
Before Song Wanzhuo had a chance to admire his beloved concubine’s cute, fresh look, he heard her voice expressing admiration for Han Zhi, which was in stark contrast to her pure and innocent appearance.
 

 
...
 

 
[Haha, the princess is too cute! Han Zhi is indeed exceptional!]
 

 
[Brothers who think they’re a good match, type “perfect match” on the screen!]
 

 
[Perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, calm down! They’re a natural pair of handsome guy and beautiful girl. How can you monsters oppose them? Tong Zhao didn’t debut as an idol, so calling her “wife” won’t get her attention. I suggest you learn to be a mother fan like me. Mommy loves you, and Mommy agrees with your early romance!]
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s heart was bleeding.
 

 
He couldn’t help but think—
 

 
Look at him, he’s handsome too, he could be exceptional!
 

 
However, after Han Zhi introduced himself, the bullet comments with green hat jokes were quickly overwhelmed by a tide of female viewers.
 

 
Even the audience was surprised by how quickly things escalated.
 

 
Every star who becomes big has, to some extent, a breakout moment.
 

 
It might be a glimpse of brilliance in their work.
 

 
It could be a random candid photo of a newcomer going viral.
 

 
Even a pre-debut bare-faced look could become a breakout moment; you never know.
 

 
The question is whether one can have such a moment and when it will arrive. No one can say for sure. Even the strongest marketing company can only try desperately and continuously, and the real breakout moment might come from an offhand remark like “It’s impossible to work,” or a candid bare-faced photo uploaded by an ordinary person, which spreads more than a professionally shot photo set done by top photographers, leaving the company frustrated.
 

 
And Han Zhi’s line:
 

 
“I’m Han Zhi, Zhi as in persistent.”
 

 
It was so surprisingly perfect and struck a chord with a large number of female viewers.
 

 
While the typical boyfriend fan mindset was shattered, Song Wanzhuo was not.
 

 
He was quite resentful.
 

 
To become a star, Han Zhi indeed has good looks. While his charm is different from his, Song Wanzhuo still felt he had a right to compete with Han Zhi. At the very least, he was Tong Zhao’s senior. If he were in a relationship with her, he could share resources and connections, offering her a lot of experience...
 

 
Just then, Tong Zhao was sitting on the sofa, drying her hair, and let out a small sneeze.
 

 
Her nose tip was red from rubbing, like a delicate little white rabbit that had been wronged.
 

 
It melted the hearts of the audience.
 

 
It was a direct hit for Lolicon fans!
 

 
Then they heard her, while glancing at Han Zhi, sighing internally: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
The extent of explosive moments in instinctive variety shows is always unpredictable.
 

 
In any case, the buzzwords [exceptional] and [sleep with him] were sure to trend.
 

 
The manager, seeing this scene, almost had a heart attack. He composed himself and consulted with the company about marketing strategies—after all, during the era of instinctive filming, they had seen all sorts of shocking comments. Since nothing really happened, they just needed to manage the narrative to avoid negative backlash.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s sigh hit a chord with many of Han Zhi’s newly arrived fans. They felt the same way, and the mainstream discussions on Weibo leaned towards this newcomer guest being incredibly exceptional, like a walking hormone.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo remained resolute.
 

 
After all, his Weibo also had countless female fans wanting to be with him, and he had received many explicit photos in private messages.
 

 
In terms of charisma, he shouldn’t be left behind.
 

 
Men are always so confident!
 

 
Soon after, the show featured Han Zhi preparing a full meal with limited ingredients.
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really didn’t know how to cook.
 

 
Sigh.
 

 
Fortunately, with the progress of the times and Tong Zhao not relying on selling romantic illusions to attract fans, male fans, while heartbroken, could still focus on posting self-deprecating comments like [I don’t believe it, I need to see them kiss with my own eyes], [What era is this! I don’t mind a polyamorous relationship QAQ], and [If worst comes to worst, I’ll switch to being a CP fan. I can do it]... and similar comments.
 

 
The audience thought this pair of handsome man and beautiful woman might fall in love at first sight.
 

 
Then they heard Tong Zhao, while smiling sweetly and softly, internally mocking Han Zhi, seeing through his true face as a scumbag playboy.
 

 
This AI-captured inner voice at least retained the interest of 30% of the audience.
 

 
"King of the Ocean" isn’t just a romance variety show; it includes elements that test both intelligence and emotional quotient. Viewers who are only interested in pure romance might not be drawn to the show from the introduction, leaving those who are excited about the clash between Han Zhi and the other contestants. When they saw Tong Zhao excessively praising this amateur male guest as if she had fallen for him at first sight, some viewers were disappointed, feeling that the main attraction was gone.
 

 
Who wants to watch a young girl being unilaterally dominated by a scumbag?
 

 
It doesn’t matter how beautiful the female guest is.
 

 
What’s exciting is the back-and-forth, the battle of wits and emotions.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s remark, "There must be a demon behind showing weakness; it’s just a ploy to sell a deep affection persona," struck a chord with the audience, resonating well.
 

 
They were hooked!
 

 
Thus, the audience honestly stayed tuned.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t disappoint; her subsequent inner thoughts continuously hit the smart AI’s sweet spots and were played one after another. She critiqued every male guest, behaving like a noble and picky beautiful cat, with humans offering various treats and services, yet not necessarily winning her favor.
 

 
If you ask why?
 

 
Ah, that’s the wonderful thing about the little cat—it’s inscrutable.
 

 
During filming, the production team thought Tong Zhao’s "true self" was too much of a green tea (i.e., manipulative), and that it might be off-putting if released. Male viewers couldn’t bring themselves to dislike her, given her stunning looks (field assistant interjects: "You straight guys probably can’t even see where she’s being green tea"), but female viewers’ impressions of her might have been significantly diminished…
 

 
However, the production team missed something.
 

 
From the omniscient perspective of female viewers, since this isn’t a serious pure romance show, they accepted Tong Zhao’s role as a scheming woman and even identified with her.
 

 
This sense of identification is the most lethal.
 

 
Who hasn’t dreamed of being a beautiful woman charming the world?
 

 
If you had Tong Zhao’s face, most people probably wouldn’t be dating ordinary men.
 

 
Even if it’s 1v1, it would be with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
So what if she’s picky?
 

 
She deserves it!
 

 
Female viewers identified with her perspective. A beautiful woman who is both clear-headed and rational, with high emotional intelligence—playing with a self-important man like He Shun is simply exhilarating.
 

 
A small portion of male viewers' dissatisfaction was drowned out by the mainstream wave.
 

 
[The real face of the green tea girl is indeed scary.]
 

 
[Wait until she turns thirty, and then others will be able to pick on her.]
 

 
[What kind of strange species are those who keep calling her a green tea girl on the bullet screen? Hurry up and block them. Our Zhao Zhao will still be a wealthy, beautiful woman who’s out of your league even after she turns thirty!]
 

 
The stricter the moral guardians are in real life, the more excited the audience becomes about the "immorality" in instinctive variety shows. After all, she hasn’t done anything wrong. She came to this show fully prepared to be a schemer and to be schemed against. A little bit of cunning, is she a green tea cat or what? Even the poop scooping job isn’t fit for losers!
 

 
The debate brought attention.
 

 
And the catalyst for ending the debate about green tea was a little puppy.
 

 
The dog was transformed by Wei Zekai.
 

 
The production team’s sensational move truly shocked the audience.
 

 
The key is that, according to the promotional material before the show aired, Wei Zekai was portrayed as the cat-like handsome man in the show—aloof and noble, like an expensive Siberian Forest cat, nearly twenty thousand per cat. Love it or leave it, and even if you buy it, it’ll give you a super fierce look.
 

 
Then he turned into a little dog.
 

 
The twist came so suddenly that it shocked the audience and left them astounded.
 

 
#LetHanZhiDebut# and #RichSecondGenerationDoesn'tActLikeAHuman# both trended on social media, with Han Zhi leading due to his exceptional looks, while Wei Zekai’s puzzled "woof" followed closely behind.
 

 
The passersby were quite amused.
 

 
The second-generation circle who knew Wei Zekai laughed uncontrollably.
 

 
Meanwhile, the Wei family elders, who had heard that their only son had invested in several entertainment industry projects recently, were not optimistic. They criticized him as an unfilial son and suggested he should have just donated the money to charity to save on taxes.
 

 
Despite their complaints, he was still the only child.
 

 
How could they not watch him on the show?
 

 
And upon watching, they saw their son had even changed species.
# Chapter36
The Wei family gathered together.
 

 
Wei Zekai had parents above him, and above them were his grandparents. His maternal grandparents also came from a scholarly family. Six people doted on him as their precious grandson, spoiling him to the point where he had a haughty attitude. No one in the Wei family was innocent in this. Fortunately, though the young master was arrogant, his nature hadn't been twisted; he was fundamentally kind-hearted.
 

 
Father Wei looked at Tong Zhao and felt she looked familiar. "Has this pretty girl been to our house before?"
 

 
He was busy with work and, even when he managed to come home, didn't have much to say to his son.
 

 
But Wei Zekai didn't have many friends—
 

 
His mouth was too sharp, and his emotional intelligence was even lower. The number of friends he could bring home was even fewer.
 

 
Tong Zhao was one of them.
 

 
"Xiao Kai brought her over to hang out before, and he also posted a group photo with his friends on Weibo," Mother Wei reminded him.
 

 
"Zesheng, what is this program about?"
 

 
Grandfather Wei didn't quite understand; he just saw his precious grandson transformed into a corgi. He hesitated and asked, "Is this a pet dating show?”
 

 
Mother Wei patiently explained, and only then did the old man understand.
 

 
The dating show was indeed a real matchmaking show, but their grandson was the pet.
 

 
On the show, there was also a bad woman and a bad man, and their grandson was responsible for exposing the two of them.
 

 
Grandmother Wei frowned as she listened. "Letting Xiao Kai take on such a responsibility? The director must not be thinking clearly."
 

 
"Isn't this show one of his investments? Maybe he paid for the judge position," someone speculated. The Wei family hadn’t watched the promotional videos for the show and didn’t know the roles were drawn randomly, so they assumed that their wealthy young master had paid a large sum to buy the role of the dog.
 

 
"Then he's not thinking clearly either," Father Wei concluded.
 

 
The relatives all nodded in agreement.
 

 
After watching the show for a while longer, seeing Wei Zekai's emotional and social intelligence almost hitting rock bottom, Mother Wei suddenly said, "I’ve always said this child takes after his father."
 

 
Father Wei sneered and shot back, "Are we resorting to personal attacks now? Why not mention how, when you were pregnant with Xiao Kai, you were supposed to eat more walnuts to boost brainpower, but you refused because you didn’t want to crack your teeth. You drank eight glasses of water a day, and it all went straight to our son's head."
 

 
"Heh.”
 

 
Both of them felt that if things continued like this, it would be difficult to solve the family's heir problem without having a second child.
 

 
While the immediate family members were whispering about whether this child took after the father or the mother, the audience, on the other hand, found that the rich second-generation kid turning into a dog was extremely adorable. The way he wobbled around on short legs, furiously wagging his little tail, was like a healing little angel. Especially when he cautiously hid away—it was turned into a bunch of reaction memes...
 

 
Unfortunately, Young Master Wei wasn’t a celebrity or an internet influencer, so there weren’t many places to use this set of reaction memes.
 

 
Only the comment section under his personal Weibo was flooded with them.
 

 
Originally, it was filled with trend-following jokes like "Young Master Wei, give us something." But now, it had turned into [Wei dog Watching Secretly.jpg], [Suddenly Transformed into a Dog.jpg], and [Wei dog, Light of Justice.jpg]...
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and his memory hadn’t fully recovered yet. When he opened WeChat, he was stunned.
 

 
Still groggy, he saw that his Moments and WeChat messages were filled with images of a silly corgi.
 

 
Young Master Wei didn’t like dogs—he was on Team Predators.
 

 
His dream was that one day, if keeping tigers as private pets became legal in China, he would keep one in his garden at home—after all, he could afford it.
 

 
He opened the WeChat group of the "Young Master Wei Charity Foundation"...
 

 
It was the group where he partnered with Tong Zhao for investments, and it was flooded with dog memes. Instantly, he was very annoyed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Stop using stupid dog memes. Use some normal ones.]
 

 
Heir A: [...]
 

 
Heir B: [...]
 

 
Heir C: [...Uh, well.]
 

 
By the time Wei Zekai realized that the stupid dog was actually him, it was already two minutes too late to recall the message.
 

 
When it rains, it pours. The joys and sorrows between people don’t always connect. As soon as Young Master Wei realized the situation and became furious out of embarrassment, his friends had already posted this chat record on Weibo to farm likes and shares.
 

 
Sure enough, the silly netizens laughed their heads off on the spot.
 

 
[Help, is this really the dog young master’s IQ?]
 

 
[If this show airs, the stock price of the Wei Group might drop by half. The future looks bleak!]
 

 
["Drop by half? My foot! As a dog fan, I hereby declare myself a spiritual shareholder of the Wei Group from now on. I heard that the Wei Group is a diversified enterprise? Has the big boss considered developing a pet product line as a side business? You’ve got a ready-made spokesperson who can work for free /dog head emoji/ dog head emoji/"]
 

 
Just as Young Master Wei was experiencing social death, the show "King of the Sea" aired the segment where the two contestants who drew the King of the Sea cards were confronting each other face-to-face.
 

 
The game hidden beneath the sweet atmosphere was shot like a movie, turning the variety show into something cinematic.
 

 
The director of "King of the Sea" didn’t have much filming experience. For a variety show, being able to edit and find highlights is enough. Not knowing how to create beautiful compositions can even be justified as "showing the real side"… In short, this director's skills were far inferior to those of "Legend of Emperor Ming," but the two contestants had great on-screen chemistry, and every glance they exchanged told a story.
 

 
The two disguised as "King of the Sea" seemed to drop their facades entirely in the pottery room—
 

 
But the AI smart system that captured their inner thoughts told a different story.
 

 
While molding a fox figurine out of clay, Tong Zhao was cursing the producers in her mind for being so inhumane: [Why can’t we do R-rated things? That’s the fastest way to expose a man’s true colors. Wouldn’t it be more straightforward to have him kneel under my bed and tell the truth?]
 

 
The audience nodded frantically in agreement.
 

 
Han Zhi's inner thoughts were filled with sighs: [So difficult to figure out. I've never seen someone like her before; it's hard to guess what she's thinking. Her face is also quite misleading. Hmm, it's tough to look her in the eyes; she's too beautiful.]
 

 
While thinking this, their gazes intertwined once again, lingering like an eternity in a single glance.
 

 
The air was filled with a sweet atmosphere that seemed like marriage was the only way this could end.
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel the intense attraction pulling them towards each other.
 

 
As their scenes played out, the number of viewers in the streaming room and the barrage of comments surged rapidly.
 

 
The backend provided the most objective and accurate data collection, analyzing the four most frequently appearing keywords: [I ship this], [driving], [ZhiZhao], and [ZhaoZhi]. This couple was so easy to ship that no additional marketing was needed; CP (couple pairing) fans were naturally born. However, this also brought about some conflicts.
 

 
Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—who would take the lead position?
 

 
When the main actors actually kissed, fans were in uproar—not just for sweet moments, but for clarity on the dynamic—
 

 
[Tong Zhao pulled Han Zhi over for the kiss; isn't it clear who's on top and who's on bottom?]
 

 
[I absolutely can't accept Tong Zhao being the bottom. Having Han Zhi dominate her? I'd rather pair her up with Wei dog.]
 

 
[How can love exist between different species?]
 

 
The Zhao-Zhi shippers felt that their beloved sister was a proper and serious star, while Han Zhi, no matter how handsome, was still a nobody.
 

 
On the other hand, the Zhi-Zhao shippers held onto their traditional beliefs, arguing that their “Brother Zhi” grabbed the back of her head and kissed her back, so why shouldn’t the man be in the leading position? Didn’t they sense the tons of testosterone emanating from Brother Zhi?
 

 
In the end, a highly upvoted comment was highlighted in red:
 

 
[Stop arguing. Would you mind if this ship had one more fan? I’m joining this family right away.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal fans felt a strong sense of crisis.
 

 
They were worried that Han Zhi might be a new rising star heavily promoted by some company, trying to ride on the popularity of their Sister Zhao. They quickly showed up to claim Zhao Zhao, saying “Not interested, don’t bring her into this,” subtly and overtly expressing disdain for the good-looking amateur.
 

 
Fan circles especially detest stepping on each other's toes, and the discussion area instantly turned into chaos.
 

 
At the same time, Xu Zhu was also watching “King of the Sea.”
 

 
Last time, her stepsister had caused her to lose a lot of face. Finally, the hype over her kneeling video had died down, but she also lost a lot of fans who came for her sweet image and "little princess" persona. The filming of "Star Selection Girls" had ended, and Xu Zhu, who debuted thanks to her backstage connections, was now bored at home with nothing to do. She spent her free time plotting to prevent her stepsister from going viral again.
 

 
There was no helping it—her stepsister was just too infuriating.
 

 
The audience was quite forgiving, and as a result, Xu Zhu attracted a new group of fans who enjoyed watching a "selfish diva." She also unexpectedly landed a film offer that aligned perfectly with the character of "Feng Sisi." Her resources were surprisingly good—truly absurd.
 

 
But Xu Zhu didn't want to take it.
 

 
She was fixated on wanting to be the "little princess."
 

 
Why should Tong Zhao get to play positive roles and rise to fame?
 

 
She couldn’t stand that her stepsister got all the benefits.
 

 
So, this time, with Tong Zhao risking it all on an instinct-based variety show, Xu Zhu kept a close eye on her, just hoping to see her sister cause a scandal out of the blue. When she saw Chang Xiaonian badmouthing Tong Zhao, calling her a “white lotus green tea b*tch”...
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she wanted to become a sworn sisters with Chang Xiaonian!
 

 
This must be the long-lost sister she was meant to find!
 

 
Finally, someone saw through her stepsister's true colors, and Xu Zhu's eyes welled up with tears.
 

 
However, the reactions on the bullet screen and Weibo once again nearly made her vomit blood in anger. Even when Tong Zhao was exposed as a manipulative flirt, the audience still liked her, thinking she was charming in her wickedness—a proud little kitten who deserved to be pampered and win in the end. Xu Zhu stared at the screen until her eyes were red, and at last, she glimpsed an opportunity to smear her stepsister's reputation.
 

 
The amateur handsome guy who got close with her stepsister became an overnight sensation.
 

 
Just like many of Tong Zhao’s fans thought, Xu Zhu suspected that things weren't that simple. She believed Han Zhi was very likely an artist that some company was planning to promote heavily. The more one knows about the industry, the less they believe in random fame.
 

 
Xu Zhu dared to be certain that Han Zhi hadn’t signed with any entertainment company only after using her connections with the Tong family to inquire multiple times.
 

 
He was truly just a regular guy.
 

 
A very, very lucky guy who participated in a mediocre show, created some incredible chemistry, and then garnered attention and a fan base that even many marketing companies couldn’t buy with money.
 

 
It was rumored that a wealthy lady who loved following celebrities took a fancy to him and spared no effort or expense to build a fan support club for him.
 

 
The fan support club, screenshots, beautified essays—everything was arranged.
 

 
Strangely, even though there was no company backing him, Han Zhi's fan base grew rapidly like weeds, with astonishing combat effectiveness, and soon it took shape.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t indulge in romantic fantasies, so her fan base was relatively calm and mature.
 

 
Han Zhi, however, was different. His persona on the variety show was that of a super flirtatious "King of the Sea.”
 

 
The fans Han Zhi attracted were mostly irrational, younger "girlfriend fans."
 

 
To put it bluntly, if even an ordinary girl like Zhong Muxi could get his "emotional charity," then these girlfriend fans—though not comparable to a female celebrity like Tong Zhao—could certainly compare themselves to someone like Zhong Muxi! "King of the Sea, notice me!"
 

 
Because Han Zhi's attitude toward Tong Zhao was different, his girlfriend fans naturally disliked her.
 

 
Anyone who opposed her stepsister was Xu Zhu's ally.
 

 
Xu Zhu immediately found this handsome guy pleasing to the eye. She took the opportunity to buy a large number of cheap internet trolls to mix into Han Zhi's fan groups and stir up trouble... After all, fan groups that have just formed are the most chaotic and fragile, unlike the more disciplined, established fandoms. This gave her a chance to exploit the situation.
 

 
[Why are you calling her "sister-in-law"? What happens on a variety show doesn’t represent reality, okay? Brother Zhi still doesn’t know his commercial value. Once he wakes up from the filming pod, he’ll realize that a whole world of opportunities is waiting for him.]
 

 
[Only older ladies would believe the scripts of instinct-based variety shows, hehe.]
 

 
[Is your idol unable to find a partner? Why do you have to pair her up with a new amateur? Taking Brother Zhi away, not interested.]
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi's girlfriend fans and Tong Zhao’s fans fighting fiercely, Xu Zhu smiled with satisfaction.
# Chapter37
With the help of the cheap internet trolls, Han Zhi’s fame became even more overwhelming.
 

 
What initially started as a fan frenzy composed of casual viewers turned into something commercialized once the trolls got involved. Xu Zhu didn’t care about the man named Han Zhi, but she wanted to use his girlfriend's fans to severely undermine her stepsister’s reputation. The more Han Zhi’s fans, the better; the more irrational and combative they were, the more damaging they would be to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Seeing the internet trolls she deployed stirring up trouble on Tong Zhao’s Weibo, Xu Zhu felt a sense of satisfaction.
 

 
Life was truly wonderful.
 

 
Just imagine, if at this moment another female star of the same age as Tong Zhao were in the spotlight, Xu Zhu would have to consider whether helping her might create a potential competitor.
 

 
But Han Zhi was a man.
 

 
No matter how much he was promoted, he wouldn’t become a stumbling block for Xu Zhu’s rise.
 

 
How could things be so perfect?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she was almost becoming a fan of Han Zhi.
 

 
With the paid trolls creating a buzz, Han Zhi managed to attract a huge amount of attention and traffic with just one episode of the variety show. His fans firmly believed that their idol was exceptional, with a bright future of boundless opportunities, and that Tong Zhao didn’t deserve him!
 

 
At the same time, within the production team of *King of the Sea*, they were discussing changes to the filming format with the guests.
 

 
There are two types of formats for instinct-based variety shows.
 

 
One is live broadcasting, like *Countdown 72 Hours*, and the other involves filming a set number of episodes in advance and then airing them, as is the case now. The former requires higher technical standards and is relatively more costly. *King of the Sea* only had Tong Zhao as a celebrity guest and was following a path of building reputation through a small-scale approach, but once the show aired, everything changed.
 

 
The viewership ratings soared from silver to gold.
 

 
The scenes of the two "Kings of the Sea" confronting each other were incredibly captivating. With additional marketing and hype, the show's viewership even rose to platinum levels.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, “Wasn’t the plan to proceed steadily? Does the live format need approval? Will it be timely?”
 

 
He had only a vague understanding of the entertainment industry and invested in *King of the Sea* primarily because of his good friend.
 

 
“Our show’s ratings have reached platinum level!” the director reminded him.
 

 
Wei Zekai hesitated, “So, what’s the difference?”
 

 
At this point, the director became excited.
 

 
“In terms of viewership ratings, black iron, bronze, and silver are one level, gold is average, and mainstream variety shows and dramas that are considered good quality in the industry are usually gold level... Platinum, diamond, and emerald are in a different league altogether.
 

 
“Reaching platinum ratings means we’ve hit the threshold for being nominated for annual awards. Sponsorships... before, we had to beg for them, but now it's their turn to seek us out. With the audience loving the show, everything is falling into place! The show is starting to make money!”
 

 
According to the data captured from the backstage, Tong Zhao was credited with the primary achievement.
 

 
In reality, Han Zhi's mysterious rise to fame was the main reason.
 

 
But since they are the same person, it meant Tong Zhao’s success was compounded. There was no more to be rewarded, only admiration.
 

 
As a result, the entire production team praised her endlessly, both internally and externally. Outsiders wanted to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao, but given her “true self” displayed on the show, which showed she was not only far from a saint but also quite scheming, they only ended up being showered with praise and flattery, no matter how much they inquired.
 

 
Firstly, Tong Zhao’s contributions were indeed significant.
 

 
Secondly, her easygoing nature and high level of cooperation.
 

 
“I always said that inviting Tong Zhao was a stroke of luck for you, Director. The show making money was only a matter of time; otherwise, would I have joined?”
 

 
The director passionately praised Tong Zhao, and Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up. He put his arm around the director's shoulder, and they became quite friendly.
 

 
He had only understood the part about “starting to make money.”
 

 
The project he invested in was starting to make money!
 

 
Tong Zhao was amazing!
 

 
The two hit it off immediately, and while hugging each other, they boasted, “Well, I think we don’t need any more sponsors. I have cooperation agreements with several companies, so I’ll take the lead. As for me, Wei Zekai, I may lack in other areas, but I’m never short of money!”
 

 
The director, though average in filming skills, was top-notch in handling relationships and skillfully made Wei Zekai very happy.
 

 
Not only did he agree to additional investment, but he also forgot about the matter of the production team turning him into a small dog.
 

 
With platinum-level ratings enhancing the show’s prestige and Wei Zekai’s generous support, the approval for live broadcasting was quickly granted. The *King of the Sea* production team hurriedly posted on Weibo to announce the good news.
 

 
@King of the Sea:
 

 
[Episode 3 will start airing in a live format under the emotional classification in instinct-based variety shows. The success of the show is closely tied to everyone's support, and we hope it continues to improve! PS: After the guest adjustments, filming will start tomorrow morning at 7 AM. The edited version will be released later. Users who purchased the live viewing rights can download it for free using the same ID, without needing to make another purchase.]
 

 
This announcement struck like a thunderbolt, and the comments on Weibo were filled with anticipation.
 

 
[Really? We can now admire the sister's beautiful face anytime, anywhere!]
 

 
[I checked, and *King of the Sea* has reached platinum level. Tong Zhao truly is a star-making machine. I remember the episodes of *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* that saw a surge in viewership also had her appearances, right?]
 

 
The program’s rating level is publicly accessible, and netizens came back to congratulate.
 

 
Only Han Zhi's fans started making sour comments.
 

 
[Some fans are too good at controlling the narrative. Are all the credits really due to her?]
 

 
[Please check the number of search terms. Han Zhi related to the show is also doing well. Our brother is low-key and doesn’t seek credit, but that doesn’t mean he should be invisible, okay?]
 

 
[The official account tagged all the guests but not Han Zhi. Please treat Han Zhi fairly.]
 

 
Fans are particularly sensitive to differential treatment.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the large number of onlookers under the official Weibo account, the two fan groups did not directly clash but each made sour remarks in their own comment sections. Han Zhi's fans felt that the production team was harsh on Han Zhi to promote Tong Zhao and expressed their sympathy:
 

 
[Yes, before the broadcast, Tong Zhao’s appeal was indeed needed, and we don’t deny that she should be thanked. I only learned about *King of the Sea* because of her. But now that Han Zhi has demonstrated his value, can’t the production team give him fair treatment? We’re not asking for special treatment, just fairness.]
 

 
[Is it possible that Han Zhi doesn’t use Weibo…]
 

 
[Are there really people who don’t use Weibo these days?]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, on the other hand, were relatively rational but still felt sorry for her from a different perspective:
 

 
[She put in so much effort to make the show a success, and yet she’s still being criticized. The princess is so unlucky.]
 

 
[It’s like tearing down the bridge after crossing it—very frustrating.]
 

 
[Have you noticed that there seems to be constant media manipulation to incite our fans to argue with those of others? Focus on your own side; who knows, by the end of the show, that person might become our brother-in-law.]
 

 
At this point, both sides were feeling a bit deflated.
 

 
The production team noticed the situation and was about to seek Tong Zhao’s opinion on whether to reveal Han Zhi’s identity in advance to prevent any further misinformation or deceitful behavior toward fans.
 

 
Before the director could make a decision, another issue arose.
 

 
Originally, male guest Lu Yiqi was released on bail for drunk driving, and upon seeing the show’s success and Han Zhi, who had replaced him, becoming extremely popular, he was dumbfounded. He was just a minor internet celebrity and had admitted his mistake in drunk driving, accepting missing out on a golden opportunity. But after seeing the rhythm brought by Xu Zhu’s hired trolls, claiming that Han Zhi had million-dollar endorsement deals waiting…
 

 
Without a manager to stop him and having no peanuts at home, Lu Yiqi, having drunk a bit too much, got emotional and started a live broadcast on Weibo to complain.
 

 
His popularity was low, but alcohol made him particularly bold. The topics he discussed were trending, and fans and curious netizens flocked to his livestream, pushing his small broadcast to the top ten in real-time trending.
 

 
“Yes, it’s my fault that I drank and drove. I accept the criticism; alcohol is truly not a good thing.”
 

 
“Can’t I have a day or two? Seeing the person who replaced me being so popular makes me really upset.”
 

 
“Stop criticizing me. I know I have flaws, but who is completely clean?”
 

 
"I was the one caught on the day of filming. Holographic variety shows are filmed for 24 hours straight. Every guest had to go through a medical examination and submit it for approval. It's fine if someone is temporarily absent, but not if someone is added last minute. I really don’t know what methods the production team used to add a new person at the last moment."
 

 
When people are distressed, their thinking can become skewed.
 

 
Lu Yiqi became increasingly frustrated as he spoke, even adding conspiracy theories: "I had prepared to apologize for delaying the shoot, but then Xiao Zhang told me everything was still going as planned... Illegal methods? I don’t think so. I just feel... they must have wanted to replace me all along! They just didn’t tell me."
 

 
"Look at the recent hot searches. The person who replaced me has a much stronger background than I do."
 

 
"I'm not confused. The person simply doesn’t exist. Damn it."
 

 
Lu Yiqi was taking it simply; he just couldn’t accept it.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s cheap hired trolls were eager to hype up Han Zhi, wishing he would become a top star by the end of the show.
 

 
Fans hadn’t started dreaming yet, but Lu Yiqi’s mentality had already collapsed.
 

 
The most painful part was not having had the opportunity; it was that he could have had it.
 

 
Lu Yiqi believed he could have been in that position too.
 

 
Fans of Han Zhi, who were mentioned in the live broadcast, flooded into the stream, took screenshots, and posted them in the comments. They made a collage with Han Zhi’s picture and wrote five big words: “[You can’t do it],” and “[Even without you, our brother is still popular].” Some fans also quoted Yang Li’s famous saying, “They look so ordinary, but they can be so confident,” to emphasize their main point—“You don’t deserve it.”
 

 
The competition with Tong Zhao’s fans was seen as positive and constructive.
 

 
It was really embarrassing to be overshadowed by an internet celebrity like Lu Yiqi, who relied on beauty filters to look handsome and was just riding the coattails of the show’s success.
 

 
The fans who were swept up by the hype from hired trolls felt that their idol was about to break out of Asia and looked down on Lu Yiqi, rejecting any association or comparison.
 

 
This wasn’t really an issue initially.
 

 
But someone pointed out a crucial detail—
 

 
Even with a fast approval process for adding people to the variety show, it would still take a day or two.
 

 
This is common knowledge in the industry.
 

 
So why does "Sea King Kill" have special privileges?
 

 
This isn't the first time someone has been bold enough to make such a move; at that time, the show’s production team chose to remove the temporary guest to maintain the overall situation. Delving deeper, if there were any dirty dealings, the show would have to keep adjusting and striving for survival.
 

 
Han Zhi’s recent popularity is undeniable, but his small fans weren't delusional enough to think the production team would sacrifice the bigger picture for him, and they were immediately panicked.
 

 
Xu Zhu's hired trolls didn't provide after-sales service and weren’t genuinely interested in promoting Han Zhi.
 

 
It would be better if "Sea King Kill" failed altogether; Xu Zhu would be willing to abstain from meat for a year in exchange for Tong Zhao’s failure. She would be delighted if Tong Zhao's career ended abruptly.
 

 
But that was just wishful thinking.
 

 
How could this be related to Tong Zhao?
 

 
She wasn’t the one breaking the law; if Han Zhi were removed, she would only be consolidating her achievements, which would actually benefit her.
 

 
However, just as Han Zhi's younger fans were anxiously in tears, like headless flies, someone they hadn’t even considered stepped forward.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
"I guarantee that Han Zhi’s appearance in 'Sea King Kill' is compliant with all regulations."
 

 
@Lu Yiqi only got one thing right: if he hadn't been so clueless, Han Zhi wouldn’t have appeared at all.
# Chapter38
No one expected Tong Zhao to step up and speak out.
 

 
At first glance, her post on Weibo seemed to be a clarification for the show.
 

 
But upon closer inspection, it carried more weight in protecting Han Zhi.
 

 
Since her debut, she had never publicly argued with anyone or engaged in drama. Her fans didn’t expect her to suddenly show her true colors and throw a jab at Lu Siqi. Han Zhi’s fans were also touched by how she stood up for him. Just as both fanbases were ready to rally behind her with cheers and support, they simultaneously began to think in the same direction—
 

 
Wait, could they really be dating?
 

 
After exiting the filming pod and regaining their memories, there was a high chance the two of them genuinely liked each other.
 

 
Amid the brewing undercurrents, the production team of "Sea King Kill" belatedly released some behind-the-scenes footage, along with an approval document.
 

 
With an official document, things became clearer!
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans’ eyes lit up; whether their idol was being backed by strong connections or was a legal figure, the former seemed much better.
 

 
However, some observant fans clicked to read the text more carefully and became even more puzzled.
 

 
The approval document wasn’t the “Long-term Instinct Film Crew Declaration” but rather the “Instinct Film Dissociative Identity Declaration (Supplementary)”...
 

 
Most casual viewers and fans don’t bother reading the text carefully. Instead, they chose to click on the easier-to-understand behind-the-scenes footage.
 

 
After a brief buffering period, the first thing that came up was an exclamation filled with shock and a strong curse:
 

 
“Damn it—Lu Siqi got thrown in jail? For what? Overusing beauty filters?”
 

 
In the busy backstage area of the “Sea King Kill” production, the entire crew had gathered, methodically adjusting the equipment. Through the monitoring window, you could see the filming pods lit with breathing lights and some of the waiting guests. Although the camera was a bit shaky and there was no timestamp, viewers quickly figured out from the rich visual information that this was shot right before “Sea King Kill” was about to start filming.
 

 
Upon hearing the news from the staff, the director's face changed dramatically.
 

 
“Oh no, he really can’t make it? Messing with our plans like this, what the [bleep], has he [bleeped—] himself? We already have few enough guests, and now we’re missing one entirely. What does the contract say—can we sue him for damages?”
 

 
“That’s not the main issue. The problem is that the filming pod we rented can’t be rescheduled.”
 

 
“If we wait for him, we’ll have to rent the pod again. If we proceed without him, the result definitely won’t be good.”
 

 
“I’m really fed up with this!”
 

 
When they learned that Lu Siqi had been caught drunk driving and sustained minor injuries, making it impossible for him to arrive at the filming site today, several core members started cursing. Even though the curses were bleeped out, their unanimous angry expressions made it clear to uninformed viewers just how much trouble Lu Siqi had caused everyone.
 

 
The viewers who initially wanted to criticize the production team also felt their anger subside a bit after seeing this.
 

 
This was truly an unexpected disaster for them.
 

 
The cost of a holographic filming pod is extremely high, not to mention the medical team on standby. With all the layers of approvals, it involves a lot of personal connections, money, and time, none of which can be wasted. Who among the working class hasn’t encountered this situation? After working hard to prepare everything, only to have it ruined by some idiot, leaving everyone stuck between a rock and a hard place.
 

 
What could they do?
 

 
As the background music filled with intense, heavy drumbeats, the sense of urgency spread throughout the backstage.
 

 
“I have a suggestion,” the modeler suddenly spoke up, “I think it might be the only solution right now. But if it fails, it could make things worse for the show, and she might not agree to it…”
 

 
“Stop keeping us in suspense! Just tell us already!”
 

 
The director urged him on.
 

 
However, the behind-the-scenes footage didn’t show the modeler’s explanation. Instead, the camera cut to the director, looking tense as he walked from backstage to the filming room, glancing around for someone. At this moment, Tong Zhao arrived on set.
 

 
The director quietly explained to her why the guest was absent.
 

 
Then he got to the most crucial part: “We could create another male model for you, as if you have the ability to change gender with this Sea King card in the variety show.”
 

 
At this point, the viewers’ eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Oh my god, this plot twist is mind-blowing!
 

 
Even casual onlookers without a stake in the matter were stunned, let alone the fans from both sides, who were so bewildered that they even forgot to control the comments. If they were whales, the ocean would surely echo with a resounding chorus of “What the hell!” bouncing back and forth like a "What the hell!" plaza.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage continued.
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed to this outrageous request and even rejected the production team's original conservative suggestion of “one person with two genders.” In the initial plan, they only wanted to create a male model for her without splitting her consciousness, which would have been safer for her.
 

 
Just like how Wei Zekai could transform into a dog and wouldn't appear in human and dog form at the same time, the male and female versions of Tong Zhao wouldn’t either. It was simply giving her the ability to switch identities and perform as both.
 

 
Tong Zhao willingly chose to bear a heavier burden by splitting her consciousness into two.
 

 
That's how Han Zhi came to be.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage recorded the birth of "Han Zhi" in fast-forward mode. He was created from a scanned projection of Tong Zhao's imagination. Such a split consciousness act, like that of Sun Wukong duplicating himself, couldn't simply be generated by forcing a random model into existence. A person's self-awareness is a highly sensitive thing; if a model were forcibly created and Tong Zhao's consciousness shoved into it, the version of her appearing in the instinct-based variety show would constantly question her own existence.
 

 
The higher the compatibility, the more natural it appears, and the more it resembles a genuinely real person.
 

 
Like the previous movie King who played two roles himself, it was the clever use of character settings that blended the points of self-doubt into the narrative conflicts.
 

 
Yet Han Zhi, this hastily made creation, somehow achieved 100% compatibility with Tong Zhao’s "true self.”
 

 
When the modeling was completed and half of Tong Zhao's consciousness was infused, the originally fast-forwarded playback suddenly slowed down.
 

 
The process of inserting a guest into the instinctive variety show often resembles scenes from an infinite-stream novel, appearing in places that wouldn't raise suspicion. This time was no exception. Han Zhi, neatly dressed, slowly opened his eyes in a high-end hotel elevator, and in that instant, his flawlessly handsome face was endowed with a soul.
 

 
Those gentle, melancholic eyes became the initial attraction for countless fans.
 

 
The astonished exclamations of "What the hell?" suddenly fell silent.
 

 
In the short behind-the-scenes video, viewers witnessed the birth of Han Zhi—a mistake born of an unexpected twist of fate. He does not truly exist, yet the moments that moved them were very real.
 

 
Being a fan is inherently both an illusory and very real experience.
 

 
Fans feel joy and pain for their idol's achievements and setbacks. A person who they will never have any real-life relationship with becomes one of the most intimate and important presences in their hearts, truly reaching the point of "Others laugh at me for being too crazy, I laugh at them for not seeing through it."
 

 
Girls have long been accustomed to what's fake.
 

 
The persona is crafted through marketing, and the face might be surgically enhanced.
 

 
It doesn't matter; their love is real—pure, passionate, and sincere.
 

 
To outsiders, stars are the moon, and fans are the sun.
 

 
When fans look at their idols, there is a light in their eyes.
 

 
Thus, these devoted followers lift them up to the pedestal, gilding them with a shining aura.
 

 
The ending of the behind-the-scenes video shows a Vlog that Han Zhi filmed after learning about his origin, unaffected by the identity card.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard clicks, a line of text appears at the bottom:
 

 
[Room decor personally chosen by "Han Zhi"]
 

 
The show’s production team always treated Han Zhi as an independent person, respecting his will.
 

 
This small detail made his fans feel a bit better.
 

 
After all, just a few minutes ago, they believed they were fans of a living, breathing person.
 

 
The spacious room's layout is simple yet avoids a cold minimalist style. The colors are subtle and elegant, with small potted plants adding green touches. Han Zhi, sitting in an ergonomic chair, relaxedly adjusted the camera and gave a gentle smile to the screen: "Hello, I'm Han Zhi."
 

 
This smile was so familiar—it was the very smile that captivated them at first glance!
 

 
Han Zhi was wearing a linen-colored trench coat over a beige T-shirt and sweater, giving off a more casual, everyday vibe compared to his appearance on the show.
 

 
The indoor light fell on his handsome face, softening his sharp features.
 

 
"How should I put this?" he mused with a gentle smile. "I just found out that I'm actually a person without a past. All the background and identity I had in 'King of the Sea' were created by the show's scriptwriters."
 

 
These should have been heartbreaking words, yet Han Zhi's voice carried a thick sense of amusement, a bit of indifference and resignation. While others might see him as suffering, he didn't feel that way and even found it quite fun:
 

 
"Now my memory is completely empty—oh, except for the part that belongs to Tong Zhao. Actually, I think it’s quite nice. Compared to false memories, this clean and straightforward feeling is better. I don't need to possess too much."
 

 
It's hard to imagine that such a calm and composed "true self" could be hidden within Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
Some handsome guys look stunning when silent, but the moment they start expressing their views, you wish they were mute.
 

 
Han Zhi isn't that kind of handsome guy.
 

 
Fans, in fact, want to hear more from him.
 

 
Even when talking about big issues, he speaks with a calm and gentle tone. When describing trivial details, he does so with a soft charm and delight. One can imagine that if such a person truly existed, whether as a lover or a friend, he could make an ordinary, mundane life sparkle.
 

 
Recently, Han Zhi's rapid rise to fame has made his fanbase increasingly aggressive.
 

 
In some shady entertainment companies, this is a goldmine.
 

 
The younger and more irrational the fans are, the easier it is to exploit them for profit.
 

 
Once the "fan-pitting" game starts, there's no turning back.
 

 
Unless the idol themselves steps in to stop it.
 

 
But when the idol themselves is just a puppet controlled by capital, or if they seek to profit from it, why would they speak up? Or rather, those who sign contracts and become products at the end of the assembly line have already had their vocal cords removed.
 

 
However, Han Zhi has no such concerns.
 

 
He said, "In the real world, the only people I have a real connection with are probably you all, who have recently gathered around me because you like me. Fame comes quickly and goes quickly; soon, you will forget about me."
 

 
Han Zhi took off his glasses, his poetic eyes filled with a gentle, unspoken sentiment.
 

 
"However, I hope that in the short time you like me, you won't be affected by negative emotions."
 

 
"If you love me, then love purely."
 

 
"Don’t neglect your family, friends, studies, or life because of your fondness for me. I hope that through your feelings for me, you can draw positive energy... When you don’t feel like memorizing vocabulary, think of me. When you don’t feel like living anymore, think of how I would feel sad."
 

 
With his distinctly jointed hand, Han Zhi gently pulled open the collar of his coat, as if opening up his heart: "See, I am not a living person. I have unlimited time to love every person who loves me. How does that saying go? ‘Brother only has you.’ Yes, that's right. So, before you love me, love yourself a bit more."
 

 
He joked about his identity and revealed a smile as if he had thought of something pleasant.
 

 
When Han Zhi isn't smiling, that face is almost too perfect—so handsome it borders on cold.
 

 
But when he smiles, the glacier melts in an instant.
 

 
"If I can add a touch of color to your life, that would be an honor. I am very happy."
 

 
When the video ended, it automatically transitioned to the next one.
 

 
Only tearful fans were left behind.

This is the emotional response from fans.
 

 
...
 

 
The industry insiders and casual observers were stunned.
 

 
No one expected that a small influencer's drunk livestream could create such a big stir, like pulling up a carrot with all the dirt still attached, with each event escalating more than the last. It started as a replacement issue, then escalated to a huge privilege scandal...
 

 
But once the truth was revealed, Han Zhi is Tong Zhao!
 

 
It was originally a baffling twist, but the program's editing of this footage was done very well.
 

 
Fans are very emotional; they’re hard to deceive but easy to appease. Most who succeed in the entertainment industry by riding the wave of fandom culture usually understand how to comfort fans. Not to mention, after Han Zhi’s five-year reign as a top star, he transitioned to serious acting and moved away from idol work, yet his popularity remained undiminished. It’s not about the flow but surpasses it.
 

 
His Vlog was a genuine performance.
 

 
Outsiders see the spectacle and think he's just incredibly handsome and lucky, with female fans obsessed to the point of madness.
 

 
Insiders see the intricacies and wonder why this amateur understands fangirls so well. In hindsight, it's mostly Tong Zhao's influence.
 

 
To be charming and seductive but not too down-to-earth—becoming purely mundane.
 

 
Fangirls are willing to devote themselves to a celestial ideal, so a certain distance must be maintained to allow for fantasy... Mastering this balance is an art.
 

 
Teenagers usually don't understand this and rely on their agents to teach them.
 

 
Tong Zhao understands this.
 

 
But she doesn't flaunt it.
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi’s success, industry insiders are already discussing—
 

 
Xu Zhu, who debuted third in "Star Selection Girls," had just finished sweating it out in the dance practice room, exhausted. When she returned to her dorm and opened her computer, she was greeted with a flood of bad news. The water army she had deployed was confused, seeking instructions from their sponsor. As she scrolled through Weibo, the related phrases and lines of text burned into her retinas…
 

 
The first message was:
 

 
@Entertainment Affairs:
 

 
"If Tong Zhao were willing to participate in a girl group variety show, she would be a top C-position debutant, and Han Zhi is the best example!"
 

 
Xu Zhu gripped her mouse tightly, her palm sweating so much that it dampened it. She stared at the stream of Weibo posts and trending topics, unwilling to accept reality while desperately searching for more leaks, her face growing increasingly pale.
 

 
The overwhelming "good news" drowned her.
 

 
All praising Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Tong Zhao's subconscious is so diverse—how many more surprises does she have that we don't know about?]
 

 
[Suggest checking Tong Zhao's mental health/dog head. Generally, actors can't handle dual roles.]
 

 
[What does Han Zhi’s rise as a new traffic representative signify? It means Tong Zhao has the ability to attract a large number of male fans, but she doesn’t peddle romantic fantasies. I can’t help but fall for her fierce demeanor. Announcing my investment! (Secretly becoming Han Zhi’s female fan should go unnoticed, right?)]
 

 
...
 

 
The mouse was clicking furiously under Xu Zhu’s grip.
 

 
Her roommate quietly climbed into bed next to her, trying to lower their presence by covering their head with a blanket.
 

 
Finally, Xu Zhu, unable to bear it any longer, closed the entire Weibo page.
 

 
Since Tong Zhenming began mentoring her and she took the stage on "Star Selection Girl," Weibo has been her favorite and most frequently used app. She enjoyed searching her own name and seeing fans showering her with praise...
 

 
When did Xu Zhu stop wanting to open Weibo?
 

 
It was probably after the success of her role as the concubine in "The Ming Emperor's Chronicles."
 

 
Why was her stepsister always so much better and more impressive than she was? Why?
 

 
Why was her stepsister always able to reverse the situation from angles she couldn’t even imagine?
 

 
Xu Zhu really didn’t think she could bring her down this time; she just wanted to make her sick.
 

 
Being entangled with the female fans of a rising star felt like attracting flies, enough to annoy Tong Zhao for a while.
 

 
Now, thinking that Han Zhi is actually Tong Zhao...
 

 
The water army she had deployed ended up being the very wind that pushed Tong Zhao to even greater heights!
 

 
Is there anything more disgusting than this?
 

 
Her roommate, peeking out from under the blanket, saw Xu Zhu rush into the bathroom, followed by the sounds of intense vomiting and faint crying. The knot of jealousy trying to surpass Tong Zhao tightened, but it seemed like nothing she did could make a difference. She could only comfort herself by thinking that at least Tong Zhenming cared deeply about his reputation, and her stepsister had a stubborn personality. As long as the father and daughter didn’t reconcile, the Tong family’s assets would always belong to her brother.
 

 
The Tong family's business is still making money!
 

 
At worst, she could go back to being a rich young lady and marry Zhao Yi.
 

 
The money earned from the Ning-Tong family marriage would definitely be better than being just a star.
 

 
※
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber twice in a row, even Tong Zhao’s body was feeling the strain. She filled the bathtub with hot water and ginger-scented bath salts, immersed herself, and took a deep breath, finally feeling like she was coming back to life.
 

 
Just then, her manager, Chu Jie, called.
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and placed it by the bathtub.
 

 
As soon as the call connected, Chu Jie’s excited voice came through:
 

 
“You’ve done an amazing job! The industry is saying that your crisis management this time was divine. Out of a possible 100 points, you scored 150—50 extra points for Han Zhi. Have you checked Weibo? The comments are all from Han Zhi’s fans apologizing and declaring their love. They’re just hoping that you’ll occasionally perform as Han Zhi in the future. I think some programs could use this identity. Honestly…”
 

 
Chu Jie couldn't contain her laughter: "I've also received several offers for you to play male leads."
 

 
"Tong Zhao? Tong Zhao, are you listening?"
 

 
"Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle..."
 

 
Tong Zhao straightened up, lifting her head out of the water: "I’m listening."
 

 
Chu Jie ignored the strange water sounds and discussed the future direction with her.
 

 
Han Zhi's identity is a great selling point. If Tong Zhao doesn’t mind, it could indeed be used as a public persona, like a virtual streamer, without needing frequent appearances.
 

 
Of course, everything needs Tong Zhao's approval.
 

 
"Let me think about it."
 

 
Tong Zhao needed to consult with Han Zhi.
 

 
All personalities are essentially different versions of herself from different times and worlds. Just as a person’s thoughts change significantly from age three to sixteen to thirty-six, so too can the thoughts between different personalities vary.
 

 
To love others, one must first love oneself. Tong Zhao respects and cherishes her other personalities because they are reflections of her former selves.
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, Han Zhi is going to become a virtual idol?]
 

 
Duan Ge was curious.
 

 
After all, in her past life, due to the end-of-the-world scenario, she never enjoyed high technology. The most advanced technology she encountered was various high-damage weapons.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [I suspect that if I had first crossed over as Han Zhi and then gone to conquer the ancient world, not only would the dog emperor have been head over heels in love with me, but the harem of three thousand beauties would have fallen for me too.]
 

 
[Exaggerated.]
 

 
In the memory palace, Han Zhi's voice was a bit colder, but still gentle: [I can do that, but Zhao Zhao, you need to be clear. Although there’s no distinction between you and me, we both hope that when we return to our original world, we will be the most complete version of Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[I understand.]
 

 
Hearing Han Zhi’s agreement, Tong Zhao accepted Chu Jie’s proposal and let her handle the details.
 

 
It was previously mentioned that each personality is a partial and extreme version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Only when they are all combined can she be considered complete.
 

 
So, they all hope that Tong Zhao won’t rely too much on any single personality.
 

 
However, decisions made by the primary personality are usually not opposed by the others.
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhao received another WeChat message from Chu Jie.
 

 
Chu Jie: [I forgot to mention, Han Zhi’s rise to fame has some artificial traces. Was it your advance purchase of Water Army? Although it was pretty low quality and quite noticeable, the result is good. Next time, let me handle such tasks, and you don’t need to worry about these things.]
 

 
...?
 

 
Tong Zhao nearly slipped and fell in the bathroom.
 

 
She repeatedly sent messages of confusion: "It wasn’t me, I didn’t do it, I don’t know."
 

 
Chu Jie told her to stop being modest.
 

 
Spending money in advance to hype up Han Zhi was a marketing strategy only someone like Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
Chu Jie: [But really, finding a water army requires spending money and finding the right channels. Don’t leave any traces. Next time, let me handle it. Otherwise, I’d be earning my salary for nothing.]
 

 
Tong Zhao denied it again, and this time Chu Jie believed her.
 

 
So, who was behind the water army?
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber, Tong Zhao felt as if she had stepped into another world. She carefully analyzed the shifts in online public opinion and identified a suspect who was both angry and amusing. She thought about it and decided to release Xu Zhu from her contact blacklist, thinking that even if she guessed wrong, it wouldn’t matter.
 

 
Surprisingly, the call went through.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice sounded cheerful: “Xu Zhu, water armies aren’t cheap, are they? It seems that Tong Zhenming really gave you a lot of money and connections.”
 

 
Xu Zhu on the other end of the phone did not respond immediately.
 

 
All Tong Zhao could hear was Xu Zhu's rapid breathing, and she was about ninety percent certain it was Xu Zhu's work.
 

 
"This really sounds like something Xu Zhu would do."
 

 
"Let me guess your thought process," Tong Zhao said cheerfully, pacing back and forth in the room provided by the production team. Her lips curled with a mischievous smile, as if she found amusement in analyzing her stepsister's behavior like playing with a cat or dog:
 

 
"You've been keeping an eye on me and noticed that the male guest spreading rumors about me attracted a bunch of impulsive, low-age fans. So you came up with a scheme to use others to attack me... Maybe 'attack' is too strong a word. You should know, this kind of drama won’t leave me without work; it might even help me maintain my topic's popularity. Four out of ten actresses on the market wouldn’t resist this kind of news, but you know me well enough to know I don’t like this kind of gossip."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, her clear laughter almost giving Xu Zhu a stroke:
 

 
"You spent money and hired a water army just to annoy me? Using the connections and financial power given to you by Tong Zhenming, you ended up turning me into a new rising star... Not everyone can achieve this, and it’s quite an accomplishment. I almost want to remove Tong Zhenming from the blacklist and have a word with him."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao really thought it was a good idea.
 

 
If she could make Tong Zhenming so angry that he had a stroke, it would be a double victory!
 

 
Xu Zhu was on the verge of a stroke.
 

 
Upon hearing that her stepsister intended to take the issue to their father, Xu Zhu panicked: “You said you wouldn’t contact him again!”
 

 
“I regret it. How can I not share such good news with him?”
 

 
“I didn’t buy the water army; I didn’t do anything. Even if you’ve offended someone without realizing it, you can’t blame me for everything!”
 

 
Realizing the situation was going poorly, Xu Zhu thought her stepsister probably didn’t have concrete evidence.
 

 
As long as she denied everything, it would be fine.
 

 
Once she came to this conclusion, she felt much more relaxed. Just as she was putting her mind at ease, she heard dialing sounds on the other end of the phone…
 

 
With a beep, the call was connected.
 

 
Whose call was it?
 

 
While she was wondering, Xu Zhu heard a very familiar middle-aged male voice: “Who is this? If you don’t speak, I’ll hang up.”
 

 
Xu Zhu’s eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually had two phones and was making a call to her father on speakerphone!
 

 
This phone was the one Wei Zekai had reminded her to handle.
 

 
He said it was about separating public and private matters.
 

 
Then, using her new phone, he also added himself to her friends list.
 

 
Tong Zhao had given him a bemused look at the time and asked about the promised separation of public and private matters.
 

 
Wei Zekai had asserted with confidence that both professionally and personally, she should stay in touch with him.
 

 
“Tong Zhenming, it’s me,”
 

 
Thinking about Wei Zekai’s situation, Tong Zhao’s voice softened, carrying a hint of pleasant amusement.
 

 
“Hmph, you only come to me when you're in trouble? When things are fine, you don’t come around?” After recognizing his eldest daughter’s voice, Tong Zhenming sneered.
 

 
He didn’t know much about the entertainment industry.
 

 
What he had recently been exposed to were the comments from Han Zhi’s fans, which his youngest daughter had shown him, either intentionally or unintentionally.
 

 
Given Tong Zhenming’s understanding of his eldest daughter’s personality, she wouldn’t seek reconciliation unless she was truly trapped in a situation with no way out…
 

 
This understanding was still not deep enough.
 

 
After all, in her previous life, Tong Zhao never bowed her head to him, even if she were to sink into the mud.
# Chapter40
"Remember to share good news with your elders," Tong Zhao muttered while glancing at the second phone. The words "[Xu Zhu, in call]" on the screen filled her with immense satisfaction. This phone wasn't on speaker, so while she could hear Xu Zhu's faint cries, Tong Zhenmíng had no idea he was being used as a tool to mock his younger daughter, unknowingly starring in a comedy.
 

 
-- "Don't you think what you're doing is childish?"
 

 
-- "You've won. You've got everything. What more do you want? Enough! I'll apologize, alright? I was wrong!"
 

 
To prevent herself from slipping into depression one day, Tong Zhao had already pressed the record button.
 

 
She could give these two father-daughter audio clips to a professional to adjust and compose into a symphony. Imagine relaxing in a bath, eyes closed, savoring the music. It would certainly make her downtime more enjoyable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "I like this idea."
 

 
The personas in her mind all praised her creativity.
 

 
In the ancient world, before concubine Chen had earned the title of consort, she had once been humiliated by a higher-ranking concubine, who had attempted to disfigure her with torture.
 

 
Although she didn’t suffer any real losses, the emperor, who had been infatuated and manipulated, was so appeased by Song Fei that he practically bent over backward for her. Later, Song Fei was demoted to a foot-washing maid by her side, and eventually banished to the Cold Palace. Everyone thought that the noble consort had long since avenged herself and should have moved on, forgetting all about Song. But not only did she not forget, she even had the emperor's personally bestowed opera troupe create a performance based on this humiliating incident. When bored, she'd have her maids feed her peeled fruit while she listened to the troupe perform.
 

 
It was like the ancient version of a song on repeat.
 

 
The noble consort never tired of hearing it.
 

 
Meanwhile, Song, in the Cold Palace, was so furious that she coughed up blood. The once-proud Lord Song, who had formally criticized Noble Consort Chen, lost all his face and reputation.
 

 
Some whispered that she was overly vindictive and petty, but this only made others more fearful of crossing her.
 

 
Two of life’s greatest joys are when your loved ones succeed and your enemies are left helplessly enraged.
 

 
"I'm currently filming a variety show," Tong Zhao began, her tone seemingly neutral but with a hint of sarcasm reaching its peak. "I'm so popular now that I have to disguise myself and wear a mask when I walk down the street. Half of the credit goes to your youngest daughter." Her words appeared polite, but the venom was unmistakable. "I won't go into detail because you wouldn't understand, but just search for 'Han Zhí' and 'Tong Zhao' online, and you'll see. She used your money and connections to buy a ton of fake accounts to smear me, but it backfired and ended up boosting my fame.”
 

 
"Impressive, Mr. Tong."
 

 
Her cold tone was laced with a hint of amusement, and the end of her sentence had a slight upward lilt.
 

 
Xu Zhu listened in utter despair.
 

 
She knew better than anyone what kind of person her father was and how much affection he really had for her—essentially none. To put it bluntly, even the real daughter raised by his side, Tong Zhao, had been harshly disciplined after daring to defy him following her mother's death. When Tong Zhao ran away from home, he didn’t bother looking for her, secretly hoping to see her fall hard and come back begging in humiliation. Xu Zhu had seen all this firsthand. While it had been satisfying to watch, it also filled her with a sense of dread. She constantly had to maintain a facade of obedience and sweetness in front of him, like a pet keeping up a flimsy father-daughter relationship.
 

 
Now, knowing his youngest daughter had spent his money and caused him to lose face in front of his eldest, what would Tong Zhenming do?
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xu Zhu’s eyes redden. Her fingertips trembled, and her voice rose in hysteria, "I didn’t! I didn’t do any of that!"
 

 
Mindful that she was still in the dorm, she couldn't say too much.
 

 
Her roommates pulled their blankets tighter, thinking the little princess of Star Select was having another episode.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's face darkened.
 

 
The more Xu Zhu desperately denied it, the more certain Tong Zhenmíng was that she was the one behind all the trouble. "Just check your daughter’s financial records, and you'll know. That's all I have to say, Mr. Tong, the philanthropist," she teased in a light, mocking tone before hanging up the phone and blocking him in one smooth motion.
 

 
She didn’t give her opponent any chance to respond.
 

 
After doing all this, she leisurely picked up the phone that was still connected to Xu Zhu. "Reporting behind someone’s back—I learned that trick from you. Turns out it works quite well."
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao only realized after falling out with Xu Zhu that every secret she had ever shared had been secretly told to her father, all to damage his opinion of her. They were nothing more than trivial teenage worries, but Tong Zhenming loved to assert his authority by disciplining his children. Controlling their secrets made him feel like the supreme ruler of the household.
 

 
It was just a typical flaw of authoritarian parents.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let Xu Zhu spend money freely. He likely kept an eye on every transaction she made. And she was certain that, true to his character, he would investigate.
 

 
Would Xu Zhu crumble and be abandoned by Tong Zhenming because of this?
 

 
Probably not.
 

 
But since Xu Zhu had gone out of her way to disgust her, Tong Zhao wasn’t just going to slap her back; she was going to make her feel equally sick.
 

 
"You damn..."
 

 
Just the thought of the incoming wrath from Tong Zhenming and the foreseeable punishment of having her allowance cut down made Xu Zhu's hands tremble, and her words crumbled in disarray.
 

 
The more panicked Xu Zhu became, the more calm and steady Tong Zhao felt.
 

 
She curled up a faint smile, "I'm the kind who holds grudges. You insult me once, and I'll slap you ten times harder. Xu Zhu, this is what you and your mother owe my mom. I'll remember it for the rest of my life. I don't mind wasting time on you, so never provoke me again."
 

 
Tong Zhao hung up the phone and promptly put her back on the blacklist.
 

 
Some people are naturally non-confrontational. Even when the other party is clearly at fault, they first reflect on themselves. After mustering up the courage to stand their ground, they still feel unsettled after the conflict. However, Tong Zhao was a different kind of person. She thoroughly enjoyed humiliating her enemies and drew immense motivation from it.
 

 
What positive self-help books don’t tell you is this: while words of encouragement from friends warm the heart momentarily, like a bowl of chicken soup for the soul, they soon fade. But the scorn and mockery from enemies often become the driving force that propels you out of bed every morning, and that motivation lasts a lot longer.
 

 
Your loving mom might tell you, "Do your best on this exam!”
 

 
The classmate who mocks your idol and steals your pen might say, "You're so obsessed with celebrities, you're definitely going to fail, haha."
 

 
Now, be honest, which one of these gives you more motivation to study?
 

 
After getting humiliated by Tong Zhao, Tong Zhenming indeed went to check the transaction records of Xu Zhu's secondary card.
 

 
Xu Zhu's connections all came from her father, so it was easy for him to inquire about his younger daughter's recent activities. When he asked his secretary about Tong Zhao's situation—despite knowing that the relationship between father and daughter wasn't good—the secretary braced himself and reported truthfully.
 

 
Upon discovering that the situation was exactly as Tong Zhao had said, Tong Zhenming's old face flushed red with both shame and anger.
 

 
Of course, he wasn’t going to reflect on why Tong Zhao had gone out of her way to mock him.
 

 
How could a patriarch ever be wrong?
 

 
In the Tong family, Tong Zhenming was the law and the truth.
 

 
When he was upset, someone had to suffer and get scolded.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao wasn't playing along with his usual tactics, the burden of his wrath fell on Xu Zhu, who had finally been accepted as his daughter.
 

 
Simply yelling over voice calls wasn’t satisfying enough for him, so Tong Zhenming dialed Xu Zhu on a video call.
 

 
When Xu Zhu received the call, she felt a chill run down her spine. Not daring to answer in her room, she rushed to the bathroom, turned on the faucet to ensure her roommates couldn’t hear clearly, and only then carefully pressed to answer the call.
 

 
"Where the hell were you? It took you so long to answer!"
 

 
The screen showed Tong Zhenming’s angry face. After seeing Xu Zhu's panicked apology, he let out a breath but immediately started yelling: "I wouldn't have known if I hadn't checked the transactions! You actually used my money to buy fake followers! Your sister used your stupidity to embarrass me. I'm spending money and effort, but not getting any appreciation! You and your mom must've been born to torment me..."
 

 
"I put you on a show, smoothed everything out, and gave you a stable debut. Do you even know how much talent you have? Look at your sister. I didn’t spend a single penny on her. I let her fend for herself, and look at where she is now. Ever since you were kids, I’ve given you and Tong Zhao the same resources, but neither your looks nor your grades ever matched hers."
 

 
"Your only advantage is that you’re obedient. I thought I could cultivate you since my older daughter turned out to be a disappointment. But no! I thought Tong Zhao was done for, but she’s bounced back. I don’t expect you to be as excellent as her, but at least don’t embarrass me."
 

 
"You got into trouble because you had too much money to spend. Your secondary card is now suspended. Once you’ve reflected on your mistakes, I’ll consider reinstating it."
 

 
Tong Zhenming took pleasure in using his financial control to punish his children. He added another threat: "If you really can’t make a name for yourself, then come back and get married."
 

 
His words hit Xu Zhu like a hammer, crushing her spirit. She didn’t even dare to plead with him because her father hated being talked back to. It wasn’t until the call ended that she wiped her face and realized she was covered in tears.
 

 
Xu Zhu was filled with resentment.
 

 
Before, Tong Zhao had been the center of attention in the family, and all she needed to do was drive a wedge between her stepsister and their father.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was no longer willing to tolerate it.
 

 
Her mother was pregnant with a younger brother, and Tong Zhenming had a thousand hopes pinned on this son. Because of the pregnancy, he couldn’t possibly get angry at her mother, leaving Xu Zhu as the only target in the family to vent on. His recent words were incredibly harsh, far more hurtful than her stepsister’s taunts—each one striking her sore spots a hundred times harder.
 

 
So, in her father’s eyes, she had always been the second choice.
 

 
Even though her stepsister had fallen out with the family...
 

 
Even though she had tried so hard, being obedient and eager to please her father...
 

 
She had thought that since her outdated father didn’t pay attention to the entertainment world, as long as she always reported good news and concealed the bad, she could keep up the illusion of her perfect image in his eyes.
 

 
But in the end, in Tong Zhenming’s eyes, she still wasn’t as good as Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu bit down hard on her back teeth, her jaw clenched so tightly that it made a grinding sound. Her heart turned cold.
 

 
What Xu Zhu didn’t want to admit was that, at this moment, she really envied Tong Zhao.
 

 
Living under Tong Zhenming’s thumb was unbearable!
 

 
But what could she do?
 

 
She hated Tong Zhenming, but she hated Tong Zhao even more.
 

 
If Tong Zhao didn’t live well, then the position of Tong family’s heiress that Xu Zhu had lowered herself to claim would finally hold some meaning.
 

 
As the sound of running water from the faucet echoed, Xu Zhu’s delicate face gradually twisted in anger.
 

 
※
 

 
Due to the change of format for *King of the Sea* into a live broadcast, the shooting was postponed, giving the guests an extra day off.
 

 
He Shun tried to invite Tong Zhao to the cafeteria via WeChat for a meal, but after being flatly rejected, he received a sarcastic message:
 

 
【Actually, I think building something from scratch is more reliable than inheriting wealth. What do you think?】
 

 
Clearly, she was referring to Wei Zekai as a rival.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and replied:
 

 
【I think starting a business doesn’t always succeed, but waiting to inherit an estate? That’s guaranteed.】
 

 
He Shun: 【…】
 

 
Just after sending the message, there was a knock on the door.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, could he be coming to ask in person?
 

 
The male and female guests stayed on separate floors, but since they were adults and the place was filled with security cameras, there weren’t strict rules like a university dorm banning opposite genders from visiting. So far, no scandals had emerged. Tong Zhao cautiously looked through the peephole and froze—
 

 
Standing outside was none other than the "waiting-to-inherit" guy himself.
# Chapter41
As soon as Tong Zhao opened the door, Wei Zekai casually slipped inside.
 

 
He sniffed the air. "Smells nice. Did you spray perfume?"
 

 
"It’s probably the shampoo. I didn’t even put on body lotion."
 

 
It was then that Wei Zekai noticed her wet hair draped over her small shoulders. He stared at it thoughtfully for a moment before saying, "Let’s talk while you dry your hair. If you stay under the air conditioner with wet hair, you'll get a headache."
 

 
"Alright."
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa, plugged the hair dryer into the socket next to it, curious about what nonsense he might spout. She couldn't help but smile, thinking how his sniffing earlier reminded her of the little dog from the variety show. With a queen-like air, she tilted her chin toward him. "Go ahead."
 

 
Wei Zekai sat next to her, holding a stack of documents in his hands.
 

 
It turned out these were investment projects they had discussed before entering the variety show.
 

 
"This is the project for Zeshan Investments."
 

 
Before joining the show, Wei Zekai hadn’t been idle. He had been running around registering the company.
 

 
As for naming the company, his friends had put in a ridiculous amount of enthusiasm…
 

 
"Not Short on Cash Investment Company," "Throwing Money Away Investment Company," "Got Scammed Venture Capital Company," "Might as Well Run Away Investment Company"… There was even a suggestion to add all the members' names, but Tong Zhao asked if the employees would go mad when handling reimbursement invoices. Another second-generation suggested it didn’t matter since they had no employees, but when they found out the company seal couldn’t fit everything, this absurd idea was abandoned.
 

 
In the end, the name "Zeshan" was chosen, supposedly after consulting a Feng Shui master.
 

 
In reality, it was an abbreviation for "Wei Zekai, Charity Gambling King."
 

 
Of course, Wei Zekai didn’t know this.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao was no longer a wealthy second-generation. The funds she had were very limited. The major financial contributors in the small group were Wei Zekai and his friends, but the profit-sharing arrangement was that Tong Zhao would take half of the earnings, excluding the principal.
 

 
Because what to invest in and how to invest was decided by Tong Zhao.
 

 
She was considered to be contributing in terms of technical input.
 

 
In the small group without Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, everyone had discussed that spending money recklessly was no problem. Investing with Wei would likely result in a loss, but only Tong Zhao could persuade him, and he only listened to her.
 

 
So, mastering the art of training dogs was also a skill.
 

 
"You’ve requested strong support for three specific apps, and after the funding was secured, their development speed has noticeably increased. Two of them have released beta versions, and I've sent you the installation packages. I think the 'Excellence Tutoring' app is quite good; it digitizes private tutoring into a one-on-one online format..."
 

 
Wei Zekai chattered on.
 

 
It was clear that he had genuinely spent time understanding the investment projects.
 

 
Investment isn’t just about putting money into a promising company and leaving it at that.
 

 
One must regularly send people to assess the results, ensuring that the money is being used effectively and not just wasted. Small companies' reports may be inflated with false data, and this is something Tong Zhao doesn’t have time to monitor. Coincidentally, this group of second-generation investors, including Wei Zekai, had received education in this area from their families.
 

 
They just lacked the vision and experience.
 

 
This made them excellent tools for Tong Zhao.
 

 
"I think we can provide some directional guidance," Tong Zhao interjected. "Since we’re at it, why not expand the scope? Is learning limited to just Chinese, English, math, and science? Why not include online guitar lessons, cooking... even towel weaving can be taught via video. The key is to recruit various talents; the tutors and the owners are both our clients and our products. Note this idea down and discuss it with them later."
 

 
As long as the money is sufficient and the equity share is high, investment companies can offer direction and even exercise dominant control over projects.
 

 
That’s why some independent studios, despite lacking funds, refuse investments—they fear being led astray by outsiders.
 

 
The app that Tong Zhao was interested in, "Excellence Tutoring," was the predecessor of the nationwide hit "Little Sheep Companion" app. It failed rapidly due to its focus on cloud-based private tutoring, and its creator, Boss Chen, faced a series of personal disasters: his startup failed, his marriage ended, and his elderly relatives died because they couldn't afford medical treatment. After his comeback, he often referenced Zhang Ailing's saying that success, when it comes too late, doesn’t feel the same.
 

 
The reason for the failure was simple.
 

 
The idea of tutoring was good, but Boss Chen overlooked that a mobile app in the eyes of students and parents is often just a tool for entertainment.
 

 
No matter how grand the name or how useful it may seem for learning, seeing students with a mobile phone often equates to them playing games. Moreover, very few people can focus on studying while holding a phone; most would end up opening "Honor of Kings" with a slight slip of the finger.
 

 
After realizing this, Boss Chen gritted his teeth and, with a hint of self-destructive determination, decided to target online gaming enthusiasts and shift to a companion app model. If that didn't work, he would just settle for working to pay off debts.
 

 
As a result, he inadvertently sparked a boom in the companion industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao saw its potential.
 

 
Actually, it would have been better to wait. If she had waited until the "Excellence Tutoring" app’s market feedback was harsh and Boss Chen’s funding chain broke, and if his elderly relatives fell ill again, Wei Zekai could have negotiated and potentially acquired it at a much lower price. However, Tong Zhao, who holds no grudges and appreciates Boss Chen’s tenacity, wouldn't be that ruthless.
 

 
The tenacity of not believing in evil, the kind that gets up and tries again after falling.
 

 
"You often play MOBA games, right? You've played Dota, LOL, and Honor of Kings. You're always complaining about your teammates being too bad and not cooperating. Why not just spend money to hire people to play with you? I want to create such a platform. I think this software is on a narrow path now; it needs to be expanded."
 

 
To ensure Wei Zekai understood, Tong Zhao specifically chose an example he was most familiar with.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaming style mirrored his own personality: a young man with top-notch skills. In the first ten minutes, he would excel across all three lanes, often trying to showcase his abilities to the point where he would get caught and killed by five opponents because no one could keep up with him. After such a rhythm break, he would start to fall apart…
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Wei Zekai understood immediately and then continued discussing other matters.
 

 
The conversation lasted for several hours.
 

 
After drying out his mouth and finishing all the bottled water in the room, they agreed on which aspects of each investment needed follow-up and guidance. The project ideas were good, and the prospects were promising, but without practical business experience, it was necessary to hire relevant talent for guidance. Tong Zhao encouraged him, “You have plenty of talent at your place; just recruit a few to help.”
 

 
Wei Zekai agreed, heading back like a prince choosing his subordinates.
 

 
After resolving the business matters, Wei Zekai left efficiently.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually checked his recent gaming achievements. It had been a while since he last played, indicating that he was indeed very busy.
 

 
……
 

 
After discussing all night, the manager concluded that making one person earn two incomes was not feasible.
 

 
It was too exhausting for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The previous medical examination report, which showed an unclear area in Tong Zhao's brain scan, also worried Sister Chu. Although Han Zhi was a cash cow, the company did not want to exploit her to the point of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. If Han Zhi was marketed as a separate entity, fans on both sides would inevitably demand equal treatment. Any resources available to Tong Zhao would need to be available to Han Zhi as well.
 

 
So, the final conclusion was not to create a separate Weibo account for Han Zhi.
 

 
Do you like Han Zhi?
 

 
Fine, just confess and send flowers under Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The official stance was that the two were considered the same person, and Sister Chu passed this approach on to the major fan heads.
 

 
As long as it wasn't too outrageous, fans generally listened to fan heads.
 

 
Sometimes, the extent of their obedience made one wonder whether they were fans of the fan heads or the celebrities themselves.
 

 
The company's decision was swift and clear.
 

 
In no time, Tong Zhao gained a large number of female fans.
 

 
Thus, among the many young celebrities, the style of comments under Tong Zhao's Weibo was particularly unique:
 

 
[Humble fan begging for Brother Zhi to make an appearance]
 

 
[Zhao Zi, take care of your health too! It's really not easy to satisfy both sides of the fans. No matter which side, you are our treasure!]
 

 
[Hello, this comment is a gathering place for double-support fans/doge emoji]
 

 
Double-support fans always hold a lower status wherever they are.
 

 
After all, the fandom often has a bit of a binary mentality, valuing purity of stance.
 

 
If you like both, it means you don't like either.
 

 
But for Tong Zhao, "double-support fans" are the mainstream.
 

 
If you only like Tong Zhao, does that mean you can’t accept her more masculine side?
 

 
If you only like Han Zhi, then you’re even more fickle; the brother you like is not even the complete package!
 

 
Damn.
 

 
Fans are easily swayed by their emotions. If you say they don’t really like the brother, they’re more eager than anyone. This passionate, selfless emotion that doesn’t consider future gains has been forcibly sustained as a trickle with Tong Zhao…
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao doesn’t have any albums to push for sales.
 

 
She doesn’t have any endorsements yet.
 

 
Fans are more impatient than she is, and some even went to the company’s Weibo to complain:
 

 
"Sister Zhao’s popularity has been so high recently, why not seize the opportunity to promote more?"
 

 
"What about endorsements? Get them lined up! Do we need to teach you?"
 

 
"I urge you to be kind; don’t ignore her treatment just because Sister is low-key and doesn’t fight for herself. We are her support; we will fight for her!"
 

 
Passionate fans attacking fellow allies, delivering a crushing blow with a critical hit of 999.
 

 
The company was both amused and helpless, quickly explaining that Tong Zhao would soon have a secondary line of luxury brand perfume endorsements. However, because Han Zhi’s unexpected rise in popularity, the brand hoped to incorporate Han Zhi's image into the endorsement promotion, which delayed the progress.
 

 
This explanation met the fans' needs perfectly.
 

 
The comments that had just viciously criticized the company suddenly turned into a spring breeze, causing the PR team to breathe a sigh of relief and marvel at how realistic things were.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, while other actresses with similar positioning to hers could not find the humor in it.
 

 
Except for those who could avoid the spotlight with a sweet and soft loli persona, other actresses in the same period were urging their managers to schedule their slots before Tong Zhao finished filming her variety show, to avoid competing with her—something they couldn’t win. Some young male stars’ managers were even inquiring with Sister Chu to find out if Tong Zhao had any intention of cross-dressing in roles meant for male stars.
 

 
Sigh, women have to be wary, and men have to be wary of her too.
 

 
This woman, why is she so annoying?
 

 
Disliking a peer is useless; it’s the fans and the audience who watch her.
 

 
Even so, before "Sea King Killer" even premiered, the number of viewers was poised to break new records, maintaining its momentum at the platinum level. Moreover, 70% of the audience was drawn to Tong Zhao, turning what was supposed to be a multi-person variety show into something like a solo performance.
 

 
Fortunately, most of the guests were ordinary people. If it relied on fellow stars who thrive on popularity, they would have laughed until they cried.
 

 
There were even idle netizens suggesting that Tong Zhao’s “true self” is so varied that perhaps a show could be made to explore how many facets of her subconscious could be revealed.
 

 
This suggestion was immediately drowned out by the spittle of fans and conscientious netizens.
 

 
[Got it, Tong Zhao is the Voldemort of the film industry, arrange for seven Horcruxes.]
 

 
[Impossible, the consciousness would be confused, and just performing alongside Han Zhi already drains Zhao Zhao’s energy. Drag out those who make such ridiculous suggestions and lock them up.]
 

 
Fans were quite worried.
 

 
To them, Tong Zhao was too challenging.
 

 
In the variety show, where she played two roles, the director had no hope that she would agree. Yet, not only did she agree, but she did so enthusiastically. While her fans were proud of her, they were also worried that she might not take care of her health. A netizen who was being attacked was anxious and said, [Tong Zhao's unique subconscious type is a gold mine. Protecting her is useless; the company won’t leave a gold mine untapped.]
 

 
Her manager, Sister Chu, was quite speechless and specifically advised her, “Don’t take what netizens say seriously. The company seeks profit, not harm. We’re not digging for gold; we’re taking care of the artist’s well-being.”
 

 
“Thank you, Sister Chu.”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave a sweet smile.
 

 
She then turned to discuss with others, “I think this idea is good. Once we have the funds, let’s invest in it ourselves. It could be like an offline meeting. I’ve even thought of a name for the show: ‘A Loving Family.’”
 

 
Concubine Shen: [Help, that sounds so tacky.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [Tacky 1]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I think it’s okay? Whatever, how about ‘Psychotic Thinking World,’ and Kai can go next door to ‘Happy Idiot Children’] She had a particular fondness for the foolish and adorable Wei Zekai.
 

 
Han Zhi also thought it sounded tacky.
 

 
However, his principle was not to criticize women unless necessary, so he listened quietly as they discussed.
 

 
Amid the laughter and the ever-increasing wave of audience, Tong Zhao lay down in the holographic shooting chamber, trying to clear her mind and make way for Han Zhi and Concubine Chen.
 

 
Probably accustomed to the dull and boring life in the palace, Concubine Chen particularly enjoyed being in the spotlight.
 

 
For such performance opportunities, she was more proactive than the other personalities.
 

 
As the machinery began to force her into a deep sleep, Concubine Chen raised her eyebrows and looked over.
 

 
In the memory palace, each personality maintained the image they cherished most in life. She was dressed in the concubine's imperial robe, the red gown with gold threads shimmering in waves as she took graceful steps, bold and dazzling. In the palace, one must first honor the clothes before honoring the person. Regardless of what others thought, everyone who saw Concubine Chen had to kneel first.
 

 
“So…” she slowly opened the topic, “our task later is to flirt with each other?”
 

 
“Our memories have all been restored,” Han Zhi reminded her.
 

 
That’s right, all the personalities remembered how passionately they had kissed.
 

 
Her question was essentially pointless.
 

 
“You should be careful; I can be very unscrupulous to win a man's heart.”
 

 
Concubine Chen snorted, her face lifting into a charming smile.
 

 
As her body gradually fell into a deep sleep under the influence of the machinery, the lights in the memory palace began to dim, casting Han Zhi’s gentle and handsome face into deep shadows, like a dangerous creature lurking in the dark depths of the sea.
 

 
“Fair point, I’ll be cautious.”
 

 
He accepted the reminder with a kind-hearted demeanor, gently holding Concubine Chen’s cool and soft hand.
 

 
The entire hall fell silently into darkness…
 

 
*
 

 
The program was already being broadcast live.
 

 
The director was adept at teasing the audience's emotions, first focusing the camera on several ordinary audience members, with an unusually long stay on Wei Zekai. Han Zhi was excluded from the "Sea King" category by Wei Zekai, making He Shun a prime suspect for that role, so the camera lingered on He Shun.
 

 
[Alert dog.jpg]
 

 
[Wei Zekai has ruled out one correct answer!]
 

 
[Want to see Brother Zhi, show him more on camera, please!]
 

 
As they spoke, many of Han Zhi's fans eagerly spent money, donning golden name tags in support of him in the live stream chat.
 

 
...
 

 
Just like in "The Truman Show," the guests were unaware that every move they made was being observed.
 

 
Han Zhi remained very composed.
 

 
Despite having a "bad boy" backstory in his character setting, he didn’t seem in a rush to pursue the girls, keeping a relaxed distance from them.
 

 
He sat on a sofa in the corner, stretching his long legs. The sunlight highlighted his profile with a golden edge, making him appear almost unreal. Fans naturally took a flurry of screenshots; unable to see their idol in real life on a schedule, they had to preserve these moments as best as they could.
 

 
Not only was Han Zhi calm, but Tong Zhao also appeared disinterested in him.
 

 
It was as if the previously passionate kissing scenes were merely the audience's one-sided imagination.
 

 
[I don’t know why, but even if they do nothing, just being in the same frame makes me feel a certain way.]
 

 
[Damn, fellow traveler.]
 

 
[Does this count as "bone science"?]
 

 
[Same person, guess it's "narcissus," self-inflicted, I flirt with myself!]
 

 
The barrage of comments was lively, though nothing much happened.
 

 
After the director emphasized the underlying tension, the focus shifted to the actual events of the day. Filming was like dreaming, with the duration determined by the brain's ebb and flow. In ordinary dreams, people often find themselves sitting at a table eating a fried egg, only to wake up and realize seven hours have passed, and it's time to go to work or school.
 

 
After He Shun, holding a teacher’s ID card, tutored Tong Zhao for two sessions, she stretched her back.
 

 
“So tired.”
 

 
The director expertly focused the camera on her.
 

 
As the young girl's slender, white arms stretched out, her waist, barely more than a handful, was also revealed on camera.
 

 
At that moment, the audience was immersed in He Shun's perspective.
 

 
Even female viewers could completely understand why this man would be captivated.
 

 
Who could resist such a stunning visual?
 

 
He Shun, overwhelmed by the breathtaking sight, was no exception.
 

 
He took the cue and said, “We've been studying all afternoon; it’s better to combine work with relaxation. How about going for a walk together?”
 

 
Due to Tong Zhao's request, their tutoring didn’t take place in the study room but rather in the living room where everyone could see them, and they spoke in low tones. From He Shun’s inner thoughts, the audience knew he had been trying to find ways to be alone with her, yet he was afraid of appearing too obvious and scaring the timid girl.
 

 
Of course, from the god’s eye view, the audience also knew...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I'm getting a bit tired of the lessons. When should I make my move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Let’s do it today. Give him a chance to seize it.]
 

 
In her inner thoughts, Tong Zhao was always lazy, her voice charmingly aloof.
 

 
The Empress Dowager was very proactive.
 

 
But her proactiveness meant graciously giving men the chance to pursue her.
 

 
She was the gatekeeper, the one who set the rules of the game.
 

 
The only reason one could win in this game named "Empress Dowager" was that she was willing to.
 

 
Watching the Empress Dowager flirt on livestream was thrilling.
 

 
Many people lamented that it would be entertaining if "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor" also broadcast Tong Zhao's psychological activities in high intensity, with one fan writing a heartfelt plea for Tong Zhao to star in a palace drama!
 

 
Seeing He Shun respond, Tong Zhao nodded with pleasure, "Sure."
 

 
She looked up at him, her eyes moist and full of reliance and a touch of admiration for the man.
 

 
Admiration with eyes full of starlight was one thing.
 

 
What was crucial was that she even pretended to work hard to hide her admiration, directly hitting the man’s soft spot.
 

 
Originally struck by the revelation that their goddess had a man in her mind, Tong Zhao's male fans were reignited with hope at this glance.
 

 
[If my wife looks at me like this, I won't be able to control myself.]
 

 
[Those who can't accept Han Zhi's male fans have no right to call her 'wife'! Zhao Bao, I'm bisexual—consider me?]
 

 
[I envy this ordinary guest so much. Any ordinary man would consider a lifetime worthwhile just to be flirted with by such a stunning beauty.]
 

 
[Exactly, being flirted with by her really leaves a lasting impression…]
 

 
This melancholic comment immediately attracted ridicule from others, mocking the commenter as if he had truly been flirted with by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Feeling his conscience, does he even deserve it?
 

 
Song Wanzhuo, who was being questioned, felt a bit suffocated.
 

 
This time, he was quite smart about pursuing his star, no longer mentioning it much on Weibo. Otherwise, his handsome and charming image would soon be reduced to that of a dog emperor. Dogs weren’t the problem; it actually proved that he played the role of Ming Emperor well, as the audience remembered him.
 

 
How many roles in an actor's lifetime can leave such a deep impression on the audience?
 

 
The issue was that ever since Tong Zhao’s various provocative actions, his "dog emperor" title now had an additional prefix—
 

 
Wearing a green hat.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was furious!
 

 
While fuming, he took two close-up shots of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Oh, Zhao Zhao, my wife is truly beautiful.
 

 
He Shun thought the same.
 

 
In addition to the large duplex villa, the estate also had a garden with small bridges and flowing water, providing plenty of private space for the guests. With such an excessively large garden, it was really hard for these six people to run into each other.
 

 
The backstage narrator timely reminded that He Shun had actually sneaked in to scout the place before.
 

 
[Damn, what does he want to do to my wife!]
 

 
[Don’t worry, any inappropriate thoughts will be detected by the intelligent AI, and the scenes you gents are hoping for won’t appear.]
 

 
He Shun really didn’t have any such intentions.
 

 
He just wanted to maintain his omnipotent, authoritative image in Tong Zhao’s eyes.
 

 
“I remember you’re very interested in biology,” He Shun said lightly, following Tong Zhao’s gaze and offering a brief lesson: “Here we have koi from the royal three families. Look at this one; its red markings on the head are particularly large, and the small round red spots on its mouth are like lipstick. This one is a golden and silver-scaled red and white koi…”
 

 
When He Shun mentioned lipstick, his gaze inevitably fell on Tong Zhao's full, slightly pouting lips.
 

 
He thought, [Even though she isn’t wearing lipstick, her lips are still so rosy. She’s just too beautiful.]
 

 
The bullet comments were merciless:
 

 
[She’s wearing lipstick, straight men need to get their eyes checked.]
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts were even more ruthless:
 

 
[Hmm, listening to him ramble on, he must have done his homework beforehand. He really wants to show off in front of me.]
 

 
[Alright, alright, he’s quite diligent. I’ll indulge him a bit.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice remained lazily indifferent.
 

 
It was as if she was playing a cliché game she had already mastered countless times, with the boss and attack patterns so familiar that she felt a bit disinterested.
 

 
With that in mind, Tong Zhao looked up at him with a smile, her eyes sparkling like a little dog: “Mr. He, you know so much.”
# Chapter42
A gentle breeze rippled across the pond.
 

 
When He Shun lowered his head, he met Tong Zhao’s gaze, which sparkled like stars.
 

 
This unprecedentedly inflated his confidence.
 

 
When a man is attracted to a woman, the most obvious behavior isn’t necessarily being nice to her, as some men tend to hold back a bit. The clearest signal is when he deliberately shows off his strengths to catch her attention. It could be his work abilities, his talent and thoughtfulness, his willingness to spend time with her, or even more, revealing his past romantic experiences. It’s like saying, “Look! I’m such a devoted, kind-hearted guy. Now, aren’t you going to get in bed with me?”
 

 
"It’s just something I happen to know," He Shun restrained himself with the last bit of rationality he had left, avoiding further showing off. "You don’t have to call me ‘teacher.’ You can just use my name. After all, I didn’t call you ‘Student Tong,’ did I?"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice: 【...Ugh, this is so cheesy.】
 

 
Contrary to her dismissive inner thoughts, she smiled gently, her white dress swaying in the wind, creating soft, layered ripples—fulfilling every man’s fantasy of the sweet childhood crush.
 

 
When the audience thought she would follow through with the sweet tactic and call him “Brother He” in a soft voice, she instead let her smile fade slightly: "Since you’re tutoring me, calling you by your full name feels a bit disrespectful."
 

 
He Shun, Brother He, Ah Shun...
 

 
No matter how she addressed him, as long as it came from Tong Zhao’s lips, He Shun wanted to hear it. Yet at this moment, Tong Zhao seemed completely oblivious to his hint.
 

 
He Shun immediately became a bit anxious: "I’ve never felt disrespected by you."
 

 
As he rushed to express his loyalty, the composed demeanor he had earlier crumbled like sand blown away by the wind.
 

 
[You want me to change how I address you without showing any sincerity? You're too greedy, Little He.] Tong Zhao's haughty inner voice revealed to the audience what was really going on.
 

 
So, the noble consort was displeased!
 

 
The live chat marveled at her skill, acknowledging that a true expert was at work.
 

 
He Shun was the typical successful, elite man—used to taking charge in relationships, often finding fault with others. However, in front of Tong Zhao, his psychological shifts were entirely under her control. Every advance and retreat was dictated by her.
 

 
A VIP viewer posted a meme from *Tom and Jerry*, capturing a melancholic Tom with the caption: "[Poor Tom, being played in the palm of her hand.jpg]". It was instantly upvoted to 999 by the live-stream audience.
 

 
It was spot on!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond verbally, only giving him a slightly puzzled look.
 

 
【This is baiting.】
 

 
【Men are natural hunters. He Shun has already invested so much time and emotional energy in me, and I'm clearly the best "stock" among the three options. He needs to see a little hope of growth—the current stagnation is just because he hasn't invested enough yet...】
 

 
【I need to make him believe that if he invests a bit more and performs better, he’ll get a return with interest on everything he's put in.】
 

 
Tong Zhao’s cold and calculating inner thoughts stood in stark contrast to her gentle and sweet exterior.
 

 
In her mind, emotions were reduced to stocks, and He Shun was merely an investor.
 

 
It seemed like the one making the choices was the investor, but in reality, there’s always someone behind the scenes—the operator.
 

 
Some of the comments, clearly from male viewers, had already started criticizing her, calling her a bad woman.
 

 
But many more found her intriguing.
 

 
“I don’t just want to be your teacher.” Picking up on her signals, He Shun immediately raised the stakes.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
He Shun softened his tone: “As a teacher, the relationship ends once the lessons are over, right? I don’t want that to happen.”
 

 
The audience was stunned.
 

 
[That’s it? That’s it? That’s it?]
 

 
[You chickened out right at the finish line?]
 

 
[We gave you the chance, and you blew it, Little He!]
 

 
Some viewers had already forgotten about He Shun's impressive credentials and high social status, which placed him in the top 80% of men in real life, and they began mimicking Tong Zhao’s tone, calling him "Little He."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile faded, becoming almost nonexistent.
 

 
She had a face that held up under scrutiny, a real beauty.
 

 
This was quite different from the sweet, girl-next-door type. When she smiled, it was pure and soft, but when she didn’t, there was a noticeable distance. It felt as though—
 

 
If he didn’t raise the stakes and show more sincerity, he was about to miss his chance to invest in her.
 

 
“Tong Zhao…” he called her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao curled her lips slightly, her tone sounding annoyed: "I don't need more friends."
 

 
The two of them stood by the pond, leaning against the bridge railing, as the wind blew through the girl’s long, curly hair, momentarily blinding He Shun.
 

 
He Shun desperately analyzed the information hidden in her words.
 

 
Tong Zhao lightly bit the inside of her cheek, using the pain to stifle her laughter, making her look even more irritated.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao didn’t explicitly say it, her signals were clear. He Shun had a sudden realization: “Of course, Tong Zhao admires me so much. She must be feeling insecure inside and really needs my reassurance and protection... I’m a grown man—should I really wait for a young girl to take the initiative? That wouldn’t be right. Ah, I just can’t help but spoil her.”
 

 
This delusional inner monologue from He Shun, full of affectionate indulgence, immediately struck the audience, who had a godlike perspective, as hilarious.
 

 
[This is the charm of a regular person—unintentionally funny?]
 

 
[I bet this is exactly what Emperor Ming thought back then—‘Oh, my poor concubine! She can only rely on my brilliant and mighty self. Look at how much she adores me. I must protect this sweet, innocent girl.’]
 

 
[...]
 

 
No need to wonder, that last comment was sent by Song Wanzhuo, whose pride had taken another hit.
 

 
“Stop roasting me already! If this keeps up, I’ll be a fool,” Song Wanzhuo thought.
 

 
Unconvinced, Song Wanzhuo decided to turn off the holographic viewing mode and switch to a traditional viewing perspective. At the same time, he opened a document, intending to write an essay reflecting on Emperor Ming’s inner thoughts. He was convinced that he and that fool He Shun were nothing alike. He had to set the record straight, refusing to let the goofy netizens continue twisting the narrative.
 

 
He Shun was an outsider to the entertainment industry, so no matter how much people compared him to Song Wanzhuo, it wouldn’t affect Song’s popularity. Because of this, Song's fans found such comments amusing and didn’t bother to stop them, even enjoying the opportunity to create an image of Song’s fanbase as well-mannered and respectful, not harassing others.
 

 
His model friend, Ling Zisheng, lit a cigarette, glancing at him: “Why are you even writing this? There's no need to clarify anything. No matter how much this outsider tries to ride your coattails, it won’t affect you.”
 

 
“I know,”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, typing away without looking up: “But what if *Baobei* sees it and mistakes me for being like that idiot?”
 

 
“Who’s *Baobei*? Do you have a girlfriend and you’re not telling your bro?”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, puzzled, lowered his head to light his cigarette.
 

 
“Zhaobao, of course.”
 

 
As he spoke, Song Wanzhuo quickly captured two close-up shots of Tong Zhao's beautiful face.
 

 
“...”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, known for his calm and cool persona, shuddered at the response, nearly burning his fingers with the lighter.
 

 
Ling Zisheng started thinking maybe their agent had a point. The biggest threat to Song Wanzhuo’s public image wasn’t having a girlfriend—it was this childhood friend of his.
 

 
At that moment, in *King of the Sea*, He Shun finally summoned the courage to say the key words: "So, do you need a boyfriend?”
 

 
Under the camera, his attempt to act relaxed was seen through clearly by the audience.
 

 
At this moment, his previous "straight man syndrome" and macho attitude didn’t seem as off-putting, and the viewers began lighting metaphorical candles for him.
 

 
["Poor He Shun, getting played like a puppet in her hands."]
 

 
["I love Sister Zhao's bad girl energy so much, please crank it up!"]
 

 
The "bad woman" Tong Zhao stepped back upon hearing this, her face flushed.
 

 
What the heck!
 

 
How was this possible? How could this woman blush on command?
 

 
The audience was utterly confused, but somehow, she just had that skill.
 

 
Tong Zhao also bruised easily, though the marks faded quickly.
 

 
"Are you confessing to me?" At this moment, Tong Zhao's earlier calm and aloof demeanor was nowhere to be found. Her sweet voice trembled slightly, and she awkwardly averted her gaze with a shy, embarrassed look: "You're older than me, more mature, you know so much, and I've never been in a relationship before. If you're just looking to play around..."
 

 
Tong Zhao's inner voice was lively: *"Then you’ve definitely found the right person!"*
 

 
Of course, she didn’t say that out loud.
 

 
Her eyes were welling up with tears, holding back her laughter.
 

 
She had to stifle her laughter as she pushed He Shun to the edge of a cliff with her flattery.
 

 
All the guests knew the rules of the game in *King of the Seas*. You could talk however you liked, but most wouldn’t register their "crush" on the app. Just like in real life, very few people would hand over their paycheck or add someone to the house deed while still dating.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were the one to bring it up first, it might trigger He Shun's suspicion or wariness.
 

 
The essence of romantic relationships is an exchange of benefits. These benefits could be appearance, companionship, money, loyalty, or even the promise of marriage.
 

 
To leverage something small into something bigger, you must use psychological tactics to create an illusion for the other party.
 

 
Why are so many women willing to act as free housekeepers before marriage? It’s because these men often give out a "promise of marriage" in exchange for actual domestic labor, claiming, "I’m working hard for *our* future happiness." But if you think about it, a promise of marriage before actually tying the knot is just empty talk. Would a man stop working hard if he didn’t have a girlfriend? Of course not—it’s nonsense, pure deception, with bad intentions.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao was exactly that kind of bad woman with bad intentions.
 

 
So, she had to keep pressing forward, step by step.
 

 
Step by step, He Shun unconsciously added more to the pot.
 

 
While pushing him to make a statement, Tong Zhao used compliments to make him believe he was the one holding all the cards, the one in control.
 

 
[--This was a trap carefully crafted after understanding He Shun's personality weaknesses.]
 

 
With Tong Zhao's calm inner voice, He Shun interrupted her self-deprecating remarks: "I’m serious. You don’t need to give me an answer right now, but I can show you my sincerity."
 

 
Saying that, He Shun took out his phone.
 

 
Under the watchful eyes of millions of viewers, he opened the official app for signaling romantic interest. After a brief loading screen, he selected Tong Zhao without a moment's hesitation and firmly pressed confirm.
 

 
As soon as He Shun pressed the button, the screen changed: “Congratulations, player! You've found your match!”
 

 
The cheesy fireworks and clapping sound effects added a bit of humor to the historic moment.
 

 
He Shun felt he was embodying the responsibility and grace of a mature man.
 

 
The chat was stunned.
 

 
[Did he really just give in that easily?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao didn’t really seem to do much, yet it feels like she did everything…]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, it's time to back off. We can't keep up with her. Isn't just being a pure looks fan or career fan enough?]
 

 
Some fans of Han Zhi jokingly commented in the livestream:
 

 
"[Oh no, oh no, Zhao Zhao scores the first point, Zhi Ge is falling behind!]"
 
"[I’m willing to fill Zhi Ge's fish pond.]"
 
"[Go for it, Zhi Ge!]"
 

 
While banter flew outside the show, real emotions of love and jealousy were unfolding within.
 

 
[...Ah, level cleared.]
 

 
The audience could easily sense the boredom in Tong Zhao’s inner voice.
 

 
However, on her face, she graciously displayed a touched expression. She played her part well, acting as if she was deeply moved by being chosen so decisively for the first time, almost as if He Shun were her savior. But, since it was her first experience, she couldn’t quickly give him an answer...
 

 
Then she added a shy smile.
 

 
To a man, it looked like the bashfulness of a girl experiencing her first love, and naturally, he wouldn’t push her for a response.
 

 
This is the advantage of showing weakness in relationships.
 

 
Outwardly weak, but inwardly strong.
 

 
It leaves the other person with no choice but to feel morally obligated!
 

 
[I wonder when he’ll realize I never actually accepted his pursuit?]
 

 
[Oh well, it doesn’t matter.]
 

 
[Let’s see who I’ll play with next.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao thought this, she and He Shun strolled around the garden for a while.
 

 
What neither they nor the audience noticed was that a fluffy little dog was hiding behind the bushes, observing them in secret...
 

 
When the director switched the camera, the audience realized that Wei Zekai was dutifully performing his role as a judge, keeping an eye on the "bad guy"! Although the distance was quite far, Wei Zekai, now a dog, had excellent hearing and could clearly hear their conversation.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Hmm, I can hear their conversation very clearly.]
 

 
The audience was alarmed—Tong Zhao was in danger!
 

 
It's normal for He Shun to be swayed by novelty and have reduced judgment due to infatuation. This can be understood.
 

 
In love, the observers are always clearer.
 

 
With a bit of romantic experience, one can step back and observe the two of them to see that there were details about Tong Zhao that seemed off.
 

 
Wei Ke: [Tong Zhao really is a...]
 

 
[Femme fatale! Femme fatale! Femme fatale!]
 

 
[Sea King! Sea King! Sea King!]
 

 
[There’s only one truth—]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s doggy eyes looked admiringly at her departing figure: [...a girl who takes relationships seriously and is pure!]
 

 
......
 

 
.........
 

 
[It’s hopeless, both Wei Zekai and I who had expectations for him are doomed.]
 

 
[For the sake of the show, why not set up a bet on how long it will take for the princess to win him over?]
 

 
[I'm reasonably suspicious that Wei Zekai is still a virgin.]
 

 
[Virgin 1]
 

 
[I want to keep following this pair!]
 

 
Wei Zekai clenched its pink paw pads and wagged its little tail.
 

 
※
 

 
The events in the garden were known to no one other than Wei Zekai.
 

 
He was aware that he didn’t get along well with the other two girls, and Wei Zekai seemed too aloof and immature, so when he was bored, he mostly chatted with Han Zhi. Interestingly, although he initially looked down on Han Zhi for being too good-looking, he found him to be quite pleasant and a good company.
 

 
However, from the audience's god's-eye view, Han Zhi showed no interest in chatting with men.
 

 
[So boring, can you not corner me into talking?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s thoughts were very cold, lacking the gentle patience he had when speaking with girls.
 

 
He felt he could converse well with Han Zhi...
 

 
Only because of the emotional intelligence gap, he was under the illusion that they had a lot in common, but it was really just that Han Zhi was playing along.
 

 
Without much thought, He Shun asked, “It looks like you must get confessed to by girls often.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback, not expecting such a personal question, and replied with a smile, “Not really, saying ‘often’ is an exaggeration.”
 

 
He Shun looked at him with a somewhat envious and dismissive gaze.
 

 
Who doesn’t want to be a popular man?
 

 
However, he already had the best one, and thinking about Tong Zhao's appearance, he spoke with a hint of superiority: "Anyway, it's definitely more than I have."
 

 
Han Zhi responded with a simple “Hmm?” and let him continue performing on stage.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This guy’s desire to perform is overflowing the screen... Should I start charging for this chat?]
 

 
The audience couldn't help but laugh.
 

 
Since learning that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, they began to see their common traits.
 

 
One of those traits was a somewhat harsh sense of humor.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t hide his amusement in his voice: “I prefer to take the initiative. Women are shy and like to play hard to get; there's nothing we can do about them, so we men have to be more proactive.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and deflected the conversation, thinking to himself: [He seems excited; he must have been won over by Tong Zhao.]
 

 
The roles in their interactions were quite clear; he understood them well.
 

 
[That seemingly perfect girl, could she actually be interested in He Shun?]
 

 
Han Zhi subtly glanced at the open door on the second floor.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t often come to public spaces and maintained a vague distance from everyone, adding to her air of mystery.
 

 
[It seems we've tacitly put each other at the bottom of the list.]
 

 
The audience sighed as they listened.
 

 
It seems we won’t be seeing any high-level matches for now!
 

 
We’ll have to settle for watching the low-level games and how they maintain their daily routines.
 

 
For the daily surprise tasks, it seemed that the production team intentionally mixed up the players' teams to create more excitement. Zhong Muxi drew He Shun, Chang Xiaonian ended up with the very cautious and handsome Han Zhi, leaving Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a pair.
 

 
The male side decides on the activities to build friendship, with restrictions against anything explicit or offensive.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a good impression of the innocent girl in his mind and took off his game headset: “Do you play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...What games?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Honor of Kings.”
 

 
……
 

 
Wearing a white dress with an ethereal, otherworldly beauty, Tong Zhao gave him a very tolerant smile and told herself: [The task content is here, there’s money to be made, cater to their interests, cater to their interests...]
 

 
So, they went to the gaming room to play ranked matches.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was actually good at Honor of Kings (in reality, she was introduced to it by Wei Zekai), the production team had set up an account for her that was exactly like the one she remembered. Wei Zekai was surprised: “You’re also a king-tier player? What role do you play?”
 

 
He doubted her ability, suspecting she was carried by a high-level player.
 

 
The word “surprisingly” sounded a bit off-putting, but Wei Zekai himself meant no harm.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a glance and tentatively showed weakness: “If you’re really good, I could play support for you.”
 

 
As soon as he agreed, Tong Zhao could stage a scenario of "The Wild King and His Supportive Little Wife."
 

 
Unexpectedly, Wei Zekai raised his eyebrows. The self-reminder to be gentle with girls evaporated instantly, and his proud and youthful demeanor emerged sharply:
 

 
“Are you trying to leech off my points?”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of anger, her feelings hurt.
 

 
From her psychological activity, the live audience could see that although she often showed weakness to men, she was actually very ambitious and had a high sense of pride. This time, she flashed a delicate smile, her aura suddenly turning sharp: “Then I’ll take the support role.”
 

 
In the first game, she played as the side lane hero, Orange Jing.
 

 
In the second game, she chose the mid-lane hero, Shangguan Wan’er.
 

 
For the third game, she picked the marksman, Gongsun Li.
 

 
Finally, before the activity time limit ended, Tong Zhao chose the support position she had mentioned at the start. With her strong performance as Ghost Valley, she roamed the entire map, controlling the rhythm of the game. Under her influence, the opponents dared not show themselves. After winning four consecutive games and earning MVP in all, Tong Zhao let out a sigh of relief, feeling her mood improve a bit.
 

 
After calming down a little, Tong Zhao suddenly realized something.
 

 
She had forgotten that this was a perfect opportunity to strategize against Wei Zekai.
 

 
She should have let him take the stage instead...
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at Wei Zekai, and as if fate had its way, he also turned towards her at that moment.
 

 
“Wow…”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at her with stars in his eyes, shining brightly: “Impressive, girl!”
 

 
…?
 

 
“Very few people can keep up with me. Your awareness and control are top-notch.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was generous with his praise.
 

 
The audience also noticed that Wei Zekai’s liking for Tong Zhao had indeed increased significantly.
 

 
[The way to marry into a wealthy family has been mastered: first, play as top-tier national server support.]
 

 
[Help, he’s not going to start seeing her as a brother, is he?]
 

 
[That look, it seems like he’s looking at a comrade.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit speechless.
 

 
She was a quick learner, young with fast reactions, and excelled in MOBA and strategy games. After the four games, she had already figured out Wei Zekai’s general personality. With that in mind, duo queue turned out to be a good dating activity, a good way to understand each other's character. At the very least, it helps to exclude boys who frequently go AFK and curse in the game.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a bit of a personal heroism streak; he wanted to win the game by carrying it himself.
 

 
At the same time, he wouldn’t abandon his teammates and had a sense of loyalty.
 

 
However, he lacked a broad perspective and was prone to focusing too much on one point, potentially losing a good game.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to do something, if Tong Zhao had more kills than he did, he would obediently follow her instructions. In a similar situation, Tong Zhao felt that He Shun would not follow orders and could only be guided through coaxing.
 

 
[Much cuter than that guy named He.]
 

 
[But he keeps secretly leeching off my lanes while jungling, which is a bit annoying.]
 

 
In contrast to Wei Zekai’s increased affection, Tong Zhao’s feelings for him slightly declined.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s evaluation of her was genuinely high.
 

 
He thought the girl was excellent, serious about relationships, and skilled at gaming.
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced at her with a bit of arrogance, thinking:
 

 
[I must protect her love.]
 

 
When the event ended, Tong Zhao closed the game:
 

 
[When should I start tricking him into taking the bait?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the other side, Han Zhi was at the villa’s bar, mixing drinks for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Wearing a long black trench coat, Han Zhi looked like he stepped out of a Korean drama, making Chang Xiaonian hesitant to look him in the face.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian appeared somewhat reserved: “You might not realize this, but I can really drink a lot. No need to make cocktails; just a bottle of white wine will do.”
 

 
Her tone was slightly lifted, deliberately rough.
 

 
This was at odds with her usual sweet persona.
 

 
She had no choice.
 

 
Despite her constant chatter with her friends about how all handsome guys are jerks, in the presence of a genuinely handsome man like Han Zhi, she felt awkward and uneasy, unable to speak freely. She was somewhat insecure. Therefore, she tried hard to appear casual and carefree in front of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no ambition to be a queen of hearts.
 

 
She subconsciously felt she couldn’t handle someone of Han Zhi’s caliber.
 

 
Regardless of any friendly signals he might give, they only served to heighten her wariness.
 

 
Han Zhi categorized this as one of the troubles of being a handsome man.
 

 
[Using "I'm not interested in you" as a subtext to protect oneself,]
 

 
Han Zhi took out the liquor he was about to mix: [Girls… are really all quite charming.]
# Chapter43
Vodka, Cointreau, lemon juice, cranberry juice...
 

 
Ice cubes clinked crisply as they tumbled into the shaker, followed by colorful liquids swirling through the air, tracing vibrant patterns.
 

 
Han Zhi's cocktail-making was effortless and relaxed, exuding a calm and skilled aura. He didn’t seem like a bartender but more like someone showcasing a personal hobby after work, displaying it only to close friends. His posture and gaze were relaxed.
 

 
Generally, when spending time alone together, one person’s nervousness can affect the other.
 

 
But with Han Zhi, that wasn’t the case.
 

 
He remained completely relaxed.
 

 
He was also patient, willing to wait slowly for his partner to drop her guard, exuding an effortless composure—If you’re nervous, go at your own pace. If you have no ideas, no experience, or no rhythm, that’s fine too. We’ll take it slow, as long as you’re happy.
 

 
Given the distance across the bar, Chang Xiaonian thought she could resist the allure of a handsome man.
 

 
It was definitely better than being alone in a private screening room.
 

 
Whenever she thought about how her slightly flattened nose affected her profile, or how her skin started to oil up after just half an hour indoors, she felt a strong urge to flee. She understood why Zhong Muxi said after watching a movie with Han Zhi—
 

 
[“He’s a really great man, but the better he is, the more I feel inadequate.”]
 

 
At the time, Chang Xiaonian had been fed a lot of the usual "girls are angels" and "you’re a perfect match" motivational talk.
 

 
But when faced with Han Zhi...
 

 
Under different influences, girls are often unable to learn the kind of “beautiful people thinking that any glance from them means interest” confidence.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian gathered her courage and took a furtive glance at him.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Han Zhi was also looking at her.
 

 
His originally indifferent and focused expression softened into a smile as their eyes met, his previously aloof and melancholic face seemed to light up with a smile because of her.
 

 
...
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned, and her heart nearly skipped a beat.
 

 
Help, where did this enchanting man come from?
 

 
The production team expertly captured this moment with a close-up shot.
 

 
Fans who had been waiting for their favorite scenes from the older brother’s segment covered their hearts and cried out:
 

 
[Although I don’t like Chang Xiaonian, I totally understand her reaction...]
 

 
[Brother Zhi’s solo performance, oh my god, it’s so sour I’m in tears.]
 

 
[Ah, I should have signed up for this variety show too! I’m willing to embarrass myself on the show!]
 

 
[Fans, give up. Your subconscious is automatically drawn to variety shows; without needing Han Zhi to charm you, you’ve already given in.]
 

 
...
 

 
"Cosmopolitan, a timeless classic."
 

 
Han Zhi pushed the prepared cocktail towards Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The lights in the bar were somewhat hazy, casting a dreamy hue over the deep red cocktail in the martini glass. It wasn’t overly bright, which would have made it look cheap; instead, it had a subtle elegance. A freshly cut lime wedge perched on the rim of the glass. This cocktail was as common as Chanel No. 5, but being commonplace meant it was very palatable, withstanding the impact of new trends, and it was also suitable for women who were not very familiar with cocktails.
 

 
Besides...
 

 
Most girls cannot resist beautifully colored drinks.
 

 
"Ah, thank you."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thanked him softly and took the glass—
 

 
Before mixing the drinks, Han Zhi had soaked the martini glass in ice water and then wiped it dry, ensuring that the cocktail would present the best flavor when served to her. The glass was pleasantly cold to the touch, and the drink was cool and smooth, with rich, silky liquor and a sweet and tangy fruit aroma.
 

 
While she sipped the cocktail, Han Zhi prepared himself a glass of gin and tonic.
 

 
A gin and tonic is quick to make, with ingredients varying from simple to complex, making it hard to mess up. It can be both very good and very bad, with a high lower limit and a high upper limit, fresh and slightly bitter. After taking a few sips, Han Zhi noticed Chang Xiaonian looking at him and pushed his glass forward with a smile. "Would you like to try this one?"
 

 
This was the glass he had used.
 

 
The ice and liquor in the glass were crystal clear, and through the bar counter, the man’s handsome face appeared to shimmer dreamily.
 

 
Under the mood of the moment, Chang Xiaonian, without much hesitation, took the glass and took a big sip.
 

 
The liquor was refreshing and slightly sweet on the palate. The unique aroma of the gin first washed over her, and as she swallowed quickly, only a hint of tonic water's bitterness remained on her tongue. Strangely, Han Zhi had somehow managed to create a gin and tonic that achieved a level of bitterness without any harshness. Han Zhi, who had prepared the drink, was watching her with a gentle and bright expression...
 

 
The two drinks he made, besides the sweet one for her, were particularly refreshing.
 

 
It seemed like he was just there to enjoy the drinks with her, rather than showing off any elaborate cocktail skills or knowledge.
 

 
Han Zhi knew exactly how she perceived him.
 

 
A handsome, aggressive playboy, a walking heart trap.
 

 
[Action is always the most compelling evidence.]
 

 
[When a woman doubts you, don’t explain. Let her interpret you herself; she will only believe what she has discovered on her own.]
 

 
Unlike Tong Zhao’s proud sarcasm, Han Zhi’s feelings about women conveyed an almost compassionate gentleness.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian propped her chin on her hands and asked, "How many girls have you made drinks for?"
 

 
She regretted asking as soon as the words were out.
 

 
"I haven’t kept count. Guests are guests. Friends often bring their friends to my place for drinks. Some might ask for cocktails they’ve seen on TikTok, like whisky with water. The technique isn’t difficult, but it’s not special—it’s just a lot of work."
 

 
Watering down whisky is a method invented by the Japanese for tasting whisky.
 

 
In summary, it involves adding ice to whisky and stirring it until the ice melts and forms a thin, even layer of frost on the surface, giving it a particularly hazy and beautiful appearance. Achieving this effect requires the bartender to stir constantly for ten to twenty minutes, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It’s annoying enough in a bar, let alone when visiting someone’s home.
 

 
"Have you made any of those?" Chang Xiaonian asked curiously.
 

 
"Mojito, Martini, and Gin and Tonic—pick one," Han Zhi replied with a hint of coolness, which amused her. "I thought you were the type to cater to every request."
 

 
"Not at all. I'm no saint."
 

 
Han Zhi lifted his glass.
 

 
As he tilted it back and drank, his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian found herself swallowing as well.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [So this is how attractive a man looks while drinking?]
 

 
The comments quickly disagreed:
 

 
[No, sister, it’s only him.]
 

 
[Our brother Zhi is a walking X medicine!]
 

 
[For close-up gifs of Zhi drinking, please click on my profile~]
 

 
……
 

 
The bar counter is a clever design.
 

 
Sitting next to each other, they can’t see each other’s facial expressions all the time, allowing for more space for imagination. When speaking softly, their shoulders might lightly touch as they whisper, a small gesture that is warm and flirtatious, like striking a match in the middle of the night.
 

 
Without needing to see Han Zhi’s face directly, Chang Xiaonian felt much more at ease. She joked, "The whisky that takes fifteen minutes to make must be really something."
 

 
"They say whisky made with the water dilution method has the best taste, but I think it’s just a gimmick."
 

 
Han Zhi continued to chat with her in a relaxed manner.
 

 
They chatted about everything under the sun.
 

 
Even without seeing his face, just hearing his deep and captivating voice coming from the left made Chang Xiaonian feel her left cheek tingle and flush. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him. This segment of the conversation was fast-forwarded by the AI during playback, causing a huge backlash from fans. It wasn’t until the special effects commentary explained that a personal cut version would be released that the outrage subsided.
 

 
Alright then.
 

 
Maybe the atmosphere was too good; Chang Xiaonian found herself completely relaxed around him, without the previous discomfort.
 

 
She even understood why Zhong Muxi, who claimed not to like men anymore, had such a high opinion of Han Zhi.
 

 
"Among the three of us, you seem most interested in Wei Zekai," Han Zhi suddenly said.
 

 
"Mm," Chang Xiaonian surprisingly admitted, "He matches my fantasy of love... I've been in relationships, but they never felt right, didn’t meet my expectations, and were different from what’s written in novels. I guess I might not have found the right person."
 

 
The comments were mixed.
 

 
[She never said this much to her girlfriends!]
 

 
[It's a waste of talent that Brother Zhi doesn’t do MLM; he easily gets people to speak their true feelings.]
 

 
[True high-level heartthrob…]
 

 
The production team was anxious as well.
 

 
The director was worried Chang Xiaonian might end up like He Shun and be an easy win.
 

 
It seemed that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were of a similar type—using subtle hints and face-to-face interactions to win people over. This could make the show less interesting. The screenwriter, seeing the director's anxiety, couldn’t help but comment, “This is a common issue with reality TV romance shows featuring celebrities and ordinary people. In real life, how could a stunning beauty like Tong Zhao fail to get a confession? A single flirtatious glance and a man would obediently walk over.”
 

 
The director shot him a sharp look: "This is your script."
 

 
The screenwriter pretended to be deaf and focused on the distant view: "Look at the messy beauty of the tangled wires in the server room."
 

 
“……”
 

 
Back to the variety show.
 

 
"The right person is very important. I believe that love, like any other skill in the world, requires practice," Han Zhi said as he stirred the drink with a long spoon. The sound of ice-clinking became the background music for his words.
 

 
He was skilled at listening, but his speaking was also charming. Even if he recited *Capital* by Marx, it would likely have the romantic poetry of sonnets and *The Flight of the Bird*: "Loving someone and accepting their affection requires repeated learning. A single instance is a rare miracle, but such miracles are often continuously depicted in literary works."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian responded with a bitter smile: "I do long for that kind of love, you know, not a rationally chosen fit, but something that makes my heart race and feel like it might burst at any moment. But when I see the other person, it feels like it's worth even dying for…"
 

 
At this moment, she almost regarded Han Zhi as a good friend to vent to.
 

 
This was the moment when Han Zhi, the handsome man, was the most indistinct in her mind as a "love interest," with the least amount of suspicion.
 

 
[If we keep this conversational pace, she might really have no feelings for me the next day.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed calmly.
 

 
Before Chang Xiaonian could finish speaking, she felt a weight on her shoulder.
 

 
Han Zhi leaned in, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and gently pulling her toward him, maintaining a slight distance without real physical contact. Chang Xiaonian looked up, her gaze fixed on the man’s handsome, alluring face, the sharp lines of his jaw, and the half-smiling curve of his lips, which were imprinted deeply on her retina.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was momentarily stunned and didn’t push him away.
 

 
She swallowed hard.
 

 
"Do you feel this way about me?"
 

 
Han Zhi’s demeanor shifted from his previous gentleness to a cold and distant gaze, yet his slightly shallow eyes were filled with an unspoken, lingering affection.
 

 
How could this kind of emotion be acted out?
 

 
Under the close-up shot, the director couldn't understand at all.
 

 
This scumbag’s acting was just too damn good.
 

 
But it wasn’t acted out.
 

 
Han Zhi’s character was shaped by the experience of Chang Xiaonian’s initial transformation into a man. Seeing women from a male perspective, he understood how much harder it was for them, which fostered a kind of affectionate empathy towards women. Thus, he could easily fall in love with someone; this feeling wasn’t fake or acted.
 

 
He hoped every girl could find happiness.
 

 
“Uh…”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned.
 

 
Her immunity to handsome men vanished in an instant.
 

 
Her senses were numbed, only able to hear the sound of her racing heart and Han Zhi’s previous words playing back in her mind with Dolby surround sound, making her almost forget to breathe.
 

 
“Don’t lie.”
 

 
Han Zhi lowered his gaze, his tone slightly stern.
 

 
Was the earlier gentleness all just an act? Under the close-up of his handsome face, Chang Xiaonian lost her ability to think normally, responding instinctively, “Yes…”
 

 
“Heart racing fast?” Han Zhi’s thin lips curled into a faint smile.
 

 
After a moment, Chang Xiaonian regained a bit of her composure, turning her face away awkwardly and taking deep breaths, “Help, this is too much. Don’t scare me like this, I can hardly breathe…”
 

 
“Have a sip of something cold to calm down.”
 

 
Han Zhi released her and pushed a glass of whiskey towards her.
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
After catching her breath, Chang Xiaonian straightened up, blushing as she stared at the glass.
 

 
She focused on the drink, as if it were engraved with a thousand words, enough to make her escape reality for half an hour.
 

 
Panicked, extremely panicked.
 

 
She hadn’t felt this way even when alone with Wei Zekai!
 

 
The last time they cooked together, she had been so annoyed by Wei Zekai’s two flirtatious moves that she wanted to scold him. Rich second-generation types were so clueless and pretentious, how arrogant!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stared at the glass for a while, suddenly noticing something different about the whiskey.
 

 
The thin layer of frost on the inside of the glass made the pure golden liquor appear to be wearing a dreamy veil, obscuring its structure. In a flash, she remembered that during their conversation, she had avoided looking directly at Han Zhi out of evasion toward handsome men. In the pauses between their words, she could also hear the sound of the long spoon stirring the drink.
 

 
This was the water-cut whiskey Han Zhi had prepared for the guest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian held the cold glass with both hands, feeling the warmth of her palms and her heart.
 

 
She asked hesitantly, “Didn’t you say this was troublesome and you didn’t want to make it?”
 

 
“Were you not curious about how a drink that takes fifteen minutes to make would look?” Han Zhi reached out and touched her ear, as if the polite gentleman before was just a facade. With millions of viewers witnessing Chang Xiaonian’s rising affection for him, he sighed and said, “And the feeling of your heart racing with excitement... Since you want to know, I’ll satisfy your curiosity.”
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was low and husky, and the spot where his large hand touched her tingled.
 

 
Fortunately, she was sitting; otherwise, Chang Xiaonian felt her legs might give out.
 

 
She took a sip of the whiskey.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [Damn, why does this whiskey taste sweet?]
 

 
Whiskey, of course, should not be sweet.
 

 
Even if it could show you images of the Virgin Mary and the Himalayas with a single sip in "The Drops of God," whiskey is fundamentally spicy and bitter. Even though it becomes smoother after water-cutting, the only reason for a sweet taste would be if her taste buds were malfunctioning.
 

 
The brain controls all the nerves.
 

 
So, it must be a problem with the brain.
 

 
When you feel moved by someone else, your brain is already beginning to malfunction.
 

 
The comments:
 

 
[Woman, something’s wrong with you.]
 

 
[The drink stirred for 15 minutes by my brother, even if it were just plain water, would still taste sweet.]
 

 
[How much money do I need to spend to get a VIP experience and see things from this female guest’s perspective?????]
 

 
Female viewers vented their excitement through comments, while male viewers took notes on these techniques that would never be used in real life.
 

 
Han Zhi cast a lazy glance over.
 

 
“Do you want to try that heart-racing feeling again?”
 

 
He didn’t give the young lady strong liquor, but the other drinks he made were strong. With his slightly tipsy eyes now even more poetic, he poured tons of hormones onto Chang Xiaonian’s heart. The audience behind the screen could hardly handle it, and she, facing this human-like walking aphrodisiac, couldn’t hold out either.
 

 
[Should I refuse him?]
 

 
[This is ridiculous; he’s actually a jerk, isn’t he?]
 

 
[Maybe he’s extremely dangerous...]
 

 
These were Chang Xiaonian’s thoughts.
 

 
What she said out loud was:
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Without hesitation, Han Zhi pulled her into his embrace.
 

 
This time, there was no polite distance; she fell solidly into his arms. She could smell a faint hint of incense on him... There was no tobacco scent as described in novels; he might not smoke at all, but she couldn’t help but inhale deeply against his chest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian wanted to listen to his heartbeat to see if it was speeding up for her.
 

 
Unfortunately, her own heartbeat was pounding so hard that she couldn’t hear anything else.
 

 
“Do you feel like a heroine in a romance novel now?” Han Zhi asked with a smile, more like teasing her.
 

 
If he had acted like this from the beginning, no matter how handsome he was, he would have received a slap.
 

 
The problem was that he was too good at setting the atmosphere, gradually breaking down her defenses.
 

 
Han Zhi had pinpointed the young woman’s vulnerabilities.
 

 
She wanted an unreal romantic adventure like in a novel, a domineering man who would lead her by the nose—an experience that Wei Zekai couldn’t provide. [That young master is barely capable of handling Tong Zhao, let alone this...] Han Zhi thought with indifference as the girl in his arms asked earnestly:
 

 
“Han Zhi, are you using a Casanova card?”
 

 
Caught out!
 

 
It turned out Chang Xiaonian wasn’t completely clueless!
 

 
The audience suddenly tensed, and the production team was delighted; finally, something was developing in the direction they had hoped for.
 

 
“Jerk, your day has come!” The assistant director rubbed his hands in anticipation.
 

 
The most interesting part of reality shows is when the seemingly unbeatable side falters.
 

 
The screenwriter coolly poured cold water on the situation: “Don’t get your hopes up too high. Hearing Han Zhi’s low voice, he could easily explain anything. Even if he said the sun rises in the west, some women might believe him.”
 

 
The stagehand raised her hand in support: “I would!”
 

 
Everyone agreed.
 

 
Given Han Zhi’s level, it was easy to charm a young girl.
 

 
…
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi pinched her chin, lifting it to force her to meet his gaze. His lips curled slightly: “Are you going to expose me?”
 

 
[???]
 

 
[Self-destruct card? Why self-destruct?]
 

 
Rarely, the production team backstage was just as stunned as the audience.
 

 
He could have easily completed the task with a lie.
 

 
From the increasing affection, it was clear Chang Xiaonian was thoroughly smitten. If Han Zhi guided her a bit more intentionally, she might fall even more for him than she did for He Shun.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian’s cheeks and eyes reddened: “Were you deliberately flirting with me?”
 

 
She was both embarrassed and annoyed.
 

 
Indeed, if it weren’t for the Casanova card, how could a handsome guy like Han Zhi be so nice and gentle to her? It was just about the reward…
 

 
Before she could escape his embrace, Han Zhi caught her hand and placed it on his chest.
 

 
Han Zhi whispered, “After seeing you, I really enjoyed the mission it gave me.”
 

 
What she felt in his palm was a heartbeat much faster than usual.
 

 
It turned out Han Zhi was just like her…!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian quickly pulled her hand away, tears on the brink of falling, but her lips curved into a smile, clearly pacified.
 

 
So, did the Casanova really fall for her?
 

 
[Alcohol is truly a great thing.]
 

 
[Low-tier Casanova gets girls drunk, whereas I just need to get myself drunk.]
 

 
Han Zhi curled his lips.
 

 
A line of special effects text slowly appeared on the screen, accompanied by the sound of keyboard typing:
 

 
“Ethanol in alcohol stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which may increase the heart rate.”
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……Impressive, Casanova!]
 

 
[Please, go line up with Tong Zhao already; stop torturing the low-tier level!]
 

 
[Only I can seduce myself/dog head!]
 

 
Han Zhi still held her, his internal monologue coldly mocking the production team’s naivety: [People always misunderstand what lovers truly want. Her question about whether I’m using a Casanova card wasn’t about being deceived, but about feeling that I don’t actually love her and that I’m only flirting with her reluctantly to complete a mission. This realization has hurt her pride, making her feel embarrassed and angry…]
 

 
[Well, as long as she knows that I do have feelings for her, that’s enough.]
 

 
[Love has no right or wrong; the more emotional a person is, the simpler their desires.]
 

 
[If you don’t delve into your lover's true needs, you’ll end up in a miserable state of endless arguments and conflicts.]
 

 
[The most important thing is, I don’t like to deceive women.]
 

 
[Here, there is no sadness, only love.]
 

 
The Casanova’s inner monologue shattered countless audience hearts.
 

 
The dating reality show had officially turned into an emotional drama.
 

 
Under the shocked gaze of millions of viewers, Chang Xiaonian became even more attached to Han Zhi upon learning his true identity.
 

 
Why is this happening?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian herself didn’t understand why she felt this way.
 

 
But Han Zhi understood—
 

 
[Once I know that I have clear points of attraction for her, she relaxes a lot, which is a good sign.]
 

 
What’s most frightening is that Casanova understands women better than women do.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian hesitated and filled in his name on the heart-throb app.
 

 
As a reward, Han Zhi lifted her face and gave her a light kiss on the forehead.
 

 
In short, he could fulfill every cliché of a romance drama.
 

 
“Alright, you win. You don’t need to pay any more attention to me from now on, okay?” Chang Xiaonian turned her face away and joked.
 

 
But the camera captured her eyes welling up with tears.
 

 
“You seem to misunderstand me,”
 

 
Han Zhi, both amused and exasperated, turned her face back to look at him and said, “I won’t let go until you learn to confidently accept someone’s affection.”
 

 
The audience was overwhelmed by how much this line sounded like a romance novel.
 

 
What kind of man can even say something like that?
 

 
“So how are you going to teach me?” Chang Xiaonian was quite taken by this approach.
 

 
“Let’s start by getting you used to looking directly at me.”
 

 
[... I just want to know what her reaction will be when she finds out that her idol and the girl she dislikes are the same person after leaving the holographic chamber.]
 

 
[Upvote 1]
 

 
[Also, Han Zhi, please start a class for us male fans!]
 

 
[Don’t teach anymore, it’s embarrassing.]
 

 
Meanwhile, in the corridor on the other side...
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was about to go downstairs to make a late-night snack, crossed paths with a dog wagging its little tail.
# Chapter44
What to do, what to do, what to do!
 

 
Since it had shrunk, everything seemed like a game from the perspective of Wei Zekai. It could almost feel a huge flashing red "Danger" character above its head... Right in front of it, Tong Zhao was towering over, staring at it. The little tail that had been wagging so happily froze, slowly drooped, and tucked itself between its legs.
 

 
Nervous.
 

 
Maybe it should turn around and run. How could a mere human catch it!
 

 
Unfortunately, by the time Wei Zekai thought of this, it was too late.
 

 
Tong Zhao had already walked up to it, bent down, and grabbed the loose skin on the back of its neck: "Why is there a dog here?"
 

 
She had been living here for quite some time and had seen plenty of koi fish in the garden, but not a single small animal. Even the guard dog was nowhere to be seen. Chang Xiaonian had sighed in relief about that, saying she was terrified of dogs and was on edge when they entered—after all, in movies, estates like this are typically guarded by a whole pack of black German Shepherds.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook the little dog in her hand: "This one doesn’t look like it could guard anything."
 

 
...
 

 
"Woof!"
 

 
What do you mean? Feeling underestimated, Wei Zekai burst into a rage and barked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
He couldn't stand being looked down upon.
 

 
Just like when he's playing games—if the opponent dares to taunt him, he’ll dive into the tower and rush to the enemy's base to trade one-for-one, no matter the risk. He always felt this was a basic move for a man of honor, a principle he sticks to, and becoming a little dog wouldn't change that.
 

 
How about that, super fierce, right?
 

 
In that small body was hidden big energy, and Wei Zekai bared his canine teeth to scare her.
 

 
This was Wei Zekai’s point of view.
 

 
He thought he was terrifying.
 

 
However, from the audience's third-person perspective…
 

 
[Hahaha, where did this little puppy trying to be fierce come from? Too cute!]
 

 
[Never thought the show’s mascot would be a rich kid, so adorably soft! Come home with me, little one.]
 

 
[Does he really think he’s intimidating?]
 

 
Quick-fingered netizens had already hit replay, captured GIFs, and added captions like [Roaring Tiger.gif].
 

 
Tong Zhao, of course, wasn’t scared.
 

 
But she did sense that the dog was trying to act tough towards her.
 

 
How coincidental, she’s not someone who can handle provocation well either.
 

 
Tong Zhao's soft lips curved into a faint smile: "So fierce, huh? Are you daring enough to bite me?"
 

 
As she spoke, she extended her hand toward the dog’s mouth.
 

 
In an instinctive reaction, even pet dogs will bite.
 

 
Tong Zhao had raised dogs before, and from the way it barked, she could tell it was all bark and no bite—a harmless pet dog.
 

 
When that soft, white hand reached the dog’s mouth, Wei Zekai froze—
 

 
What are you doing!
 

 
He’s not really a dog after all; he’s still quite conscious of gender, so he quickly turned his head to the side.
 

 
“Heh.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, holding him by the scruff of his neck with one hand and supporting his little Dog bottom with the other, walking toward her room: "No need for a midnight snack; let's play something else."
 

 
Naturally, Wei Zekai wasn’t willing to be taken to the room.
 

 
It kicked its legs, struggling to break free, but didn't dare show its claws. As a result, Tong Zhao pressed it into her arms, forcibly subduing it.
 

 
And then it quieted down.
 

 
Because where she pressed it... was soft and fragrant —
 

 
Its little tail wagged, and the entire dog gave up.
 

 
Wei Zekai swore, he never intended to use his ability to transform into a dog to take advantage of girls. And because of his integrity, the intelligent AI didn’t detect any inappropriate thoughts, so it didn’t issue any warnings... This proved that, even though the little dog’s face was pressed into an indescribable place, his thoughts were completely innocent.
 

 
But the audience wasn't so pure.
 

 
[Let go of that dog, let me take its place!!!!]
 

 
[I can't wait to see how awkward he'll feel when he gets his memory back after this.]
 

 
[Wei Corgi can't breathe / dog emoji]
 

 
["A Blessing in Disguise"]
 

 
"You're quite obedient."
 

 
Tong Zhao originally thought it would struggle for a while, but unexpectedly, it quieted down as soon as she pressed it into her arms. After entering her room, she quickly shut the door, cutting off Wei Corgi's escape route. When she finally released her hold on it, it immediately slumped against her shoulder, gasping for fresh air.
 

 
‘Phew… almost suffocated me to death.’
 

 
‘Good thing it didn’t last long, or I’d have lost my dog's life.’
 

 
Wei Zekai’s inner thoughts, still filled with lingering fear, sparked outrage from the audience.
 

 
Unbelievable, this guy doesn't know how good he has it!
 

 
Tong Zhao patted its back: "It's boring being alone. From now on, I’m your owner."
 

 
Dog Wei: Huh?
 

 
Dog Wei: You think you're worthy of being my owner? Really think I’m just a dog? You’re nothing.
 

 
As he spoke, Dog Wei barked twice at her, trying to act fierce again.
 

 
For the moment, he didn’t think about jumping down, but then he saw Tong Zhao carrying him toward the bathroom.
 

 
[!!! Is she going to bathe with the dog?]
 

 
[So exciting! Is this really content they can air? Not treating us like outsiders at all, huh?]
 

 
[GKDGKDGKDGKDGKD!]
 

 
When the bathroom door closed, Dog Wei really started to panic. He jumped to the floor, frantically scratching at the door and barking loudly, clearly signaling Tong Zhao to let him out. Unfortunately, she ignored him and began filling the bathtub halfway with water. After testing the temperature and making sure it was right, she turned back to the supposedly fierce little puppy with a gentle smile.
 

 
Sensing something, Dog Wei turned around too.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao taking a bath wouldn’t be aired.
 

 
But bathing a little dog? No problem.
 

 
“Woof? Woof! Woof woof woof!”
 

 
Wei Zekai froze, half his body being pressed into the warm water.
 

 
He kicked and splashed wildly in the tub for a while, and when he realized that the splashing water was getting Tong Zhao’s clothes wet, he didn’t even dare to resist anymore.
 

 
The viewers weren't happy about this.
 

 
[Come on, move a little, doggi! Just move a bit!]
 

 
[We don't need the extra traffic, turn it up a notch, please.]
 

 
[Give it a rest. Even if her clothes do get wet, the AI would blur it with extreme pixelation before anyone can screenshot it. Don’t underestimate how well this show protects the guests’ privacy.]
 

 
With a stunned expression that could shake an entire family, Dog Wei was thoroughly scrubbed all over. It wasn’t until Tong Zhao dried his fur with a blow dryer that he snapped out of his shock, though his inner thoughts were still filled with doubts about his dog life—
 

 
Did I just get bathed by someone?
 

 
What do I do!?
 

 
...It felt kinda nice though...
 

 
As Wei Zekai's rationality returned, he remembered that he only had one hour in this transformed state. He had to escape before the hour was up, or his identity would be exposed! But no matter how much he struggled, Tong Zhao held him tightly, leaving him utterly hopeless—
 

 
Damn it, why did he have to turn into a Dog?
 

 
If only he were a large dog, he wouldn't be so powerless right now!
 

 
"Struggling so much... is it because you don’t want to be my dog?" Tong Zhao asked, looking down at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sensing a glimmer of hope, nodded frantically.
 

 
Yes, he remembered that Tong Zhao was supposed to be a gentle, sweet girl who wouldn’t make things difficult for a dog.
 

 
Just as he thought this, he saw Tong Zhao’s elegant and sweet face curl into a smirk.
 

 
Gentle and sweet?
 

 
Her usually clear, light-colored eyes were now swirling with arrogance and mischief. The malice in her gaze pierced Dog Wei's confidence like tangible tendrils. With his keen dog hearing, he clearly caught her next two sentences:
 

 
"I like dogs that don't like me."
 

 
"From now on, you're my dog."
 

 
...
 

 
Dog Wei was baffled.
 

 
Gentle and sweet? That doesn’t exist—she was just playing with them.
 

 
Behave now, it's time to kneel and call her master.
 

 
Tong Zhao patted his head.
 

 
In her mind, however, she thought, ‘This dog is too smart; it must belong to someone.’
 

 
She decided to keep an eye out for any missing dog posters over the next couple of days, but for now, she'd play with him before returning him to his owner.
 

 
Dog Wei kicked his back legs against her shoulder, hoping to bring back the gentle and kind girl he thought she was. However, his defiant legs were quickly caught in her hand. "You're all clean now, time for bed," she said as she carried the little dog toward the bed.
 

 
The audience collectively let out a sharp "hiss."
 

 
Dog Wei began to struggle.
 

 
By this time, only five minutes remained before his transformation would wear off.
 

 
On-screen, the poor little dog was shown with its limbs restrained. Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, grabbed his tail, saying, "I’ve got your little tail, behave."
 

 
Dogs aren't naturally tailless. Originally, tails were docked for cattle herding purposes, but later it became a cosmetic trend for pets.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s dog, who still had his tail, now had his weakness held in Tong Zhao's hands.
 

 
‘Crap! Let me go, let me go, let me go!’
 

 
Dog Wei’s inner thoughts were a complete mess.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew exactly how to handle small dogs. Although she had him firmly under control, it didn’t hurt him. His mind was completely blank.
 

 
Finally, with three minutes left, Wei Zekai managed to brush against a ticklish spot on Tong Zhao’s waist. As she loosened her grip from the tickling, he rolled off the bed, sprang up, and used his front paws to press down on the door handle, slipping out through the gap in the door. By the time Tong Zhao rushed out after him, she saw the little corgi scrambling and rolling in a series of tactical maneuvers, running straight into Wei Zekai’s room.
 

 
Moments later, the door closed behind him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Huh? So this dog belongs to Wei Zekai?’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Come to think of it, they do seem alike.’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘But I’ve never seen him walk a dog... And after all that noise just now, he didn’t come looking for it, which is kind of weird. Though I was the second-to-last one to arrive at the manor, so maybe he settled in earlier. Hmph, if he owns a dog, Chang Xiaonian's dream of marrying into a rich family might be shattered, since she’s afraid of dogs.’
 

 
Without a dog to cuddle anymore, and feeling a bit tired after all the commotion, Tong Zhao regretfully got ready for bed.
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai, now back in human form, swore he would never turn into a dog again!
 

 
That was way too terrifying!
 

 
He locked the door from the inside and threw himself onto the soft bed, his heart pounding wildly.
 

 
“Damn it, stop thinking about it, just pull up the blanket and sleep!”
 

 
According to the Polar Bear Law, the more you try not to think about something, the more vividly it comes to mind. The brain, it seems, is everyone’s biggest traitor. Wei Zekai was now facing this very dilemma—
 

 
He hadn’t realized it when he was barking, but just now... where had his face been buried on Tong Zhao?
 

 
Crap?
 

 
That night, some slept soundly, while one “dog” struggled to sleep at all.
 

 
※
 

 
The next day at noon, while out for a group activity, Wei Zekai was approached by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Casually, she asked, “Do you have a dog? Last night I saw one running into your room.”
 

 
“No!” Wei Zekai denied it in an instant. “You must’ve seen wrong.”
 

 
“...”
 

 
Tong Zhao had only asked offhandedly.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reaction was way too strong—so strong that it was suspicious. She was sure she hadn’t seen wrong. The dog had definitely run into his room, and the door had only closed after the dog went inside, which meant someone had been in there. She lowered her eyes and didn’t press further. “Hmm, I guess I must have been mistaken.”
 

 
She was so easygoing, it was like she wasn’t the same mischievous girl from last night.
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t help himself and kept sneaking glances at her face.
 

 
Her side profile was just as flawless as her full face, with her nose and lips shaped perfectly. When she looked at someone, she often smiled before speaking, which made her seem especially sweet.
 

 
So why was she so unfriendly to dogs?
 

 
Recalling last night’s ordeal, Wei Zekai still felt lingering fear.
 

 
It was the first time he had been grabbed by the scruff of his neck, had his tail pulled, and then been dunked into a bathtub like that.
 

 
His intense reaction caught Tong Zhao’s attention—
 

 
Wei Zekai had already been her second target to pursue, so she had been watching his every move closely.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: There’s definitely something strange about that dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao's thoughts:
 

 
“The door was only ajar and got pushed open by that little corgi. When a dog is panicking, why didn’t it run down the stairs? Obviously, Wei Zekai’s room made it feel safer. Wei Zekai is lying... With his personality, if he didn’t want me near his dog, he would’ve said so directly instead of lying.”
 

 
One suspicious point after another surfaced.
 

 
Viewers sighed:
 

 
[Give it up, Young Master Wei, you can't outsmart her.]
 

 
Though the idea of someone turning into a dog seemed too far-fetched, Tong Zhao was still heading in the right direction.
 

 
After all, anyone with the "Judge" identity card would have special abilities.
 

 
Maybe the official gave him a well-trained dog to spy on other players’ moves, which would explain why he lied to cover it up. Otherwise, why would he hide the dog? If Wei Zekai was the Judge, she would need to be extra cautious. At the very least...
 

 
She couldn’t let him suspect that she was the "Sea King."
 

 
She needed a convincing reason to get closer to Wei Zekai.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Even though I don’t really want to use this method...”
 

 
From her tone, the viewers could tell she was genuinely reluctant.
 

 
But what method was she thinking of?
 

 
[Seduction! Seduction! Seduction!]
 

 
[Wake up, those of you chanting for seduction! Do you really think that’s going to work on the last clean soul in our rich kids' circle? No way.]
 

 
The director aptly cued in a heavy, suspenseful beat as background music.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned in slightly and extended a very crucial invitation:
 

 
"Wanna duo later?"
 

 
For someone of her caliber, using gaming skills to lure a guy was a bit of a downfall.
 

 
But this was exactly the bait Wei Zekai would fall for.
 

 
Playing with a skilled partner who could work well with him was too much fun, and a look of hesitation immediately appeared on his handsome face. After a brief struggle, he nodded reluctantly:
 

 
"Alright!"
 

 
Damn it, he couldn’t resist the temptation of a duo match!
 

 
Not far away, He Shun, noticing the two of them chatting animatedly, started to feel uneasy. However, when he saw that they were just playing a popular mobile game, he felt relieved:
 

 
He Shun: "Oh, they’re just gaming."
 

 
He Shun didn’t realize that playing games together, especially in a duo, was an excellent way to strengthen emotional bonds.
 

 
Viewers who were into pure love found it amusing.
 

 
After seeing a lot of flirting, a dose of wholesome interaction wasn’t bad for a change.
 

 
However...
 

 
These two really were *just* playing the game.
 

 
Tong Zhao, multitasking, tried to steer the conversation toward relationships, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not:
 

 
"You're pretty good at this game. Do you often carry girls?"
 

 
"Women only slow down my sword speed!"
 

 
[......]
 

 
"So, you’ve never dated anyone?"
 

 
"Never dated, doesn’t matter," Wei Zekai said with a smile after securing the first kill in the game. "Love isn’t a necessity. If I had to say, I’m more interested in protecting other people’s love right now."
 

 
Even though he didn’t want to turn into a dog again, Wei Zekai still remembered his duties as the Judge.
 

 
And that night, the scene of Zhong Muxi self-harming in the kitchen...
 

 
That was someone unrelated to him, but he really didn’t want to see another tragedy.
 

 
[Alright, that's quite pure.]
 

 
[If it weren't for the fact that instinctive variety shows can’t fake things, I'd suspect this is a rich kid playing a character.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, the cold and ruthless swordsman just wants to protect others' love. Is this setting making you ship him?]
 

 
The director zoomed in on Tong Zhao.
 

 
You could see her lips twitch slightly after hearing that, on the verge of smiling but also a bit shocked.
 

 
Clearly, she was unimpressed by such idealistic talk about “protecting others' love.”
 

 
As viewers watched, they realized that the down-to-earth Tong Zhao was a bit mischievous.
 

 
Somewhat unkind but not over the top.
 

 
Far more interesting than the flat, clichéd characters in traditional variety shows.
 

 
After an afternoon of gaming, the two of them had become an unbeatable team and collected many stars. However, Tong Zhao felt that advancing her strategy with Wei Zekai was still a long way off. The director appropriately revealed the affection ratings between them:
 

 
Wei Zekai’s affection for Tong Zhao was at 70%, with the note: “He already considers you a reliable ally!”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s affection for Wei Zekai had dropped to 30%, with the note: “An incomprehensible single-celled organism, should stay single forever.”
 

 
The viewers were in stitches.
 

 
It seemed even the "Sea King" had hit a snag!
 

 
[The feelings are there, but if you ask what kind of feelings, I’d say it’s a friendship bond.]
 

 
[Hahaha, poor Tong Zhao, I want to see how the strategy with Han Zhi is progressing.]
 

 
There wasn't much eye-catching progress on Han Zhi's side.
 

 
However, his solo cut had the highest purchase rate among the six guests, even surpassing Tong Zhao.
 

 
The reason was simple: he was accompanying Chang Xiaonian in playing a romance game.
 

 
As long as fans paid to become premium members and got Chang Xiaonian's first-person perspective, it was practically like dating Han Zhi. No female fan could resist this kind of temptation! Except for kissing, everything else was included—hand-holding, hugging, and Han Zhi always found new ways to make her happy, fulfilling all her romantic fantasies from romance novels.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t require her to keep their relationship a secret, but she still kept quiet about it.
 

 
She didn’t want him to dislike her or cause him any trouble.
 

 
But there was one thing...
 

 
“Han Zhi, your remaining tasks should be pursuing Xiao Xi and Tong Zhao, right?” Chang Xiaonian asked out of the blue while playing board games in the game room. She actually knew the answer but still wanted to ask.
 

 
Perhaps immersed in the sweet and happy atmosphere, Chang Xiaonian no longer referred to Tong Zhao as “that woman.”
 

 
She seemed to have lost her previous resentment towards others.
 

 
Even though she knew that her relationship with Han Zhi was temporary and had a time limit, she didn’t grow to love him more. Instead, she felt better about herself. Han Zhi looked at her with admiration—if such a handsome guy thought she was great, why should anyone else think otherwise? She believed she would meet the right person and deserved all the tenderness.
 

 
In the past, Chang Xiaonian’s view of others was very black and white, like in those face-slapping novels.
 

 
Showing various favors to men was seen as being a green tea bitch.
 

 
He Shun was a typical straight man.
 

 
Wei Zekai was an arrogant, overbearing rich second-generation.
 

 
Han Zhi? He must be the kind of guy who knows how to play the game well and is a scumbag everyone should avoid.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian first spent time alone with Han Zhi, she had placed herself in a very low position...
 

 
But now things were different.
 

 
"Hmm," Han Zhi said, grabbing her hand as she was shuffling the cards. "Since you keep bringing up other girls, I'll punish you by holding my hand for a minute."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian smiled brightly, intertwining her fingers with his, and said with a tone of concern, "If you keep talking about other girls, you could increase the punishment. How about holding hands for half an hour? I don’t know Tong Zhao well, so I’m not worried about her. As for Xiao Xi, she was dumped by a scumbag before, and... I saw an old scar on her wrist, which might indicate she has a tendency for self-harm. I’m not good at comforting people, and we only see each other occasionally at events. If you’re interested in pursuing her, could you be a bit nicer to her? I think you could make her happy."
 

 
She was very clear that a man like Han Zhi was beyond her control.
 

 
Having a period of time with good memories was already a blessing.
 

 
Moreover, she did indeed hope for a genuine romantic relationship.
 

 
"Let’s end our relationship here. I can’t wait to use the methods you taught me to love someone else," Chang Xiaonian said frankly, treating him as a tool.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t annoyed. In fact, he was quite pleased that she was speaking openly to him.
 

 
However...
 

 
The dynamics of dominance and submission still needed to be managed carefully.
 

 
He gently lifted their clasped hands, placed a kiss on her wrist, and glanced at her, his perfectly sculpted nose brushing against the back of her hand. “Don’t you want me anymore?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
The young woman was immediately flustered and overwhelmed.
 

 
After her face reddened and she calmed down a bit, it was half an hour later.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, having made her decision, left with a big smile, making Han Zhi feel even more like junk food—something not to be overindulged in but which brings a smile when consumed. As he thought this, he began to clean up the remnants of their game.
 

 
Just as he was tidying up the board game toys, he heard the sound of the door opening behind him.
 

 
“How surprising,”
 

 
came Tong Zhao’s lazy voice. “She didn’t cry and run away?”
 

 
“I don’t like making girls cry.”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t turn around, knowing she would approach.
 

 
Sure enough, he heard the footsteps getting closer.
 

 
“Wow, a scumbag who doesn’t like making girls cry, sounds like you have some principles,” Tong Zhao sneered and walked up behind him, seeing the board game "Operation Code" on the table, revealing a bored expression. “Is this what you bring girls on dates to play?”
 

 
“There are other games. Do you want to try? There’s a queue.” Han Zhi still didn’t turn around, his tone a bit indifferent.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pair of slightly cool, soft hands wrapped around his neck from behind, lifting his chin to make him face her directly.
 

 
“I have things I dislike doing and things I enjoy doing,”
 

 
She said, her charming face holding up under this hellish angle. Han Zhi saw her eyes crescent-shaped with mischievousness, clearly a bad woman. His expression remained neutral, but his usually warm face turned unusually cold and distant, indicating that Tong Zhao’s mention of other girls had touched a sensitive spot.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t care at all.
 

 
Not only did she want to step on his sensitive spot, but she also wanted to dance on it with unrestrained joy.
 

 
“First, I hate waiting in line, so I’m going to cut the queue.”
 

 
“Second, unlike you, I actually enjoy making men cry.”
# Chapter45
In East Asian cultural environments, male tears are often suppressed.
 

 
Men's tears are rarely shed, and men are expected to bleed without crying…
 

 
It all sounds quite tragic for men, but it also creates a certain appeal— the more they resist showing vulnerability, the more one wants to peel away their strong facade, to see their genuine emotions. In the moment of their collapse, to kiss their tears, accept their sharp edges, and embrace their weakness.
 

 
With her delicate hand, Tong Zhao gently caressed Han Zhi's chin, her mind filled with an unspoken dark amusement.
 

 
In the close-up, her fingertips lightly traced over his Adam's apple.
 

 
[Ugh, Tong Zhao really has the face of an Omega with the demeanor of an Alpha.]
 

 
[Male viewers might be confused—what is an Alpha?]
 

 
[For the male viewers up front, don’t leave. I’ve got a file on the topic to discuss with you…]
 

 
Han Zhi grasped her wrist and lifted his eyelids, looking at her with an expressionless face.
 

 
His eyes, hidden behind his lashes, were deep and intense, as if they might pull someone in, never to return.
 

 
“Want to make me cry? That’s a bit of a challenge.”
 

 
She touched his cervical vertebra.
 

 
The bone, connected to the muscles, held a latent explosive strength like a leopard. Her cool fingertips traced over his muscle lines, which were all describable parts, yet the atmosphere between them was rapidly approaching an unbroadcastable red line: “What about your gentlemanly conduct towards women? Come on, cry for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled with a provocative and unruly attitude.
 

 
Han Zhi found himself somewhat at a loss with this type of behavior, feeling as if he had missed a step. It was a mix of reluctance and anger—why was she so domineering with him? However, his tolerance for women was particularly high. He took the opportunity to pull her into his lap and kissed her ear: “Stop messing around… If I cried, it wouldn’t be anything special. ‘Pear blossoms bring rain’ is used to describe women, right? You’d definitely look better crying than I would.”
 

 
“That’s true.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She herself had used fake crying to achieve her goals before.
 

 
Once she was seated in his lap, the audience began anticipating more risqué scenes.
 

 
However, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, they exchanged information.
 

 
“I know you won’t reveal other girls’ private matters, but it seems you’ve taken care of Chang Xiaonian,” Tong Zhao said confidently, leaving him no room to refute. Han Zhi silently looked at her, knowing that explaining wouldn’t help, and indeed, her statement was true: “So, you’ll need to win me over.”
 

 
Although it wasn’t explicitly stated, both were aware of each other's Sea King cards.
 

 
Similar to games like "Werewolf" and "Blackout", recognizing identities wasn’t the end of the game. Their interests didn’t conflict but instead had the potential for a win-win situation. He needed Tong Zhao’s decisive choice, and she equally needed his.
 

 
The most likely outcome was that they would exchange contact details, with mutual selection leading to the successful completion of their tasks.
 

 
Han Zhi could have pushed back at this moment.
 

 
But he smiled, his expression gentle as he let her lead, appearing as if he was at her mercy: “My Queen?”
 

 
“...Ah, so tacky,” Tong Zhao pinched his perfectly straight nose. “Are you deliberately hitting my sore spots? Scumbag.”
 

 
“Wronged, Master.”
 

 
The more he called her names, the more excessive it became. Han Zhi couldn’t help but laugh, rubbing against her neck like a big dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew him too well. He wasn’t even remotely like a canine. While wolves understand the need to obey the alpha, this man, under his obedient facade, had a heart as restless and wandering as a stray. If he were to be described, he’d be like a wild leopard that’s hard to tame—comes around for food and then runs off quickly when uninterested. Infuriatingly so, yet he had such a stunning coat and an endearing voice.
 

 
At that moment, she heard unusual noises coming from the game room door.
 

 
But her attention was quickly drawn back by Han Zhi.
 

 
“Let’s talk about your situation,”
 

 
Han Zhi noticed a small, particularly cute mole on her neck: “How are things with that young master? He doesn’t seem to be a match for you.”
 

 
...
 

 
It was exactly the wrong topic to bring up. Tong Zhao wanted to roll her eyes at him.
 

 
But she held it in.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most stereotypical straight man she’d ever met, as if he hadn’t fully awakened to his secondary sexual characteristics. Under his handsome face was only a straightforward life of enjoyment—no romance involved. But she didn’t want to lose face in front of her peers, so she took the opportunity, while he was focused on her neck and couldn’t see her expression, to sigh deliberately: “What’s he playing at? He’s such an innocent kid who can’t handle the game. He’s quite cute. I plan to have a serious talk with him.”
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been examining the mole on her neck, was stunned by her words: “...A serious talk?”
 

 
It was as if he had heard some urban legend.
 

 
“Yeah, I like him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said openly, and when she saw him trying to lift his head to look at her, she quickly rubbed her face against his cheek: “It’s the first time I’ve met this type, and I really like him. I have to treat him well.”
 

 
This statement couldn’t be called half-truth; it was pure nonsense.
 

 
However, with someone like Han Zhi, it’s hard to discern the truth from lies when he can’t see someone’s face. Tong Zhao’s voice was sweet and enchanting, making it difficult for him to make a correct judgment. Moreover, he had to admit... Wei Zekai did have a pretty impressive appearance.
 

 
He couldn’t help but ask: “You really like that type?”
 

 
“Never tried it before.”
 

 
This answer was highly credible to the King of Sea, immediately convincing Han Zhi.
 

 
He bit her neck as if in frustration: “Have you tried my type?”
 

 
[He’s getting anxious!]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s accidental advantage turned out to be superior; she’s ahead this time!]
 

 
[I’d call Wei Zekai the ultimate tool man!]
 

 
The audience felt it, and Tong Zhao naturally picked up on the subtle details in Han Zhi’s tone.
 

 
Although he quickly masked his displeasure in the subsequent conversation, as if nothing had happened, Tong Zhao knew very well. In high-stakes situations, even the tiniest flaw can lead to a total loss. She had only intended to cover up her inability to handle Wei Zekai, but it unexpectedly stirred up Han Zhi’s jealousy.
 

 
So, he can be jealous too?
 

 
It was a bit cute, and the speed at which he suppressed that emotion was quite amusing.
 

 
After catching his little slip, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but smile with a touch of schadenfreude.
 

 
Is jealousy a sign of affection?
 

 
Not necessarily, but at least it indicates a bit of interest. Tong Zhao completely believed in his self-control, but it was like taking a kill from a strong opponent—it was worth celebrating. She felt a great sense of accomplishment, almost wanting to flip this big leopard over and play with its snowy white belly.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him sideways: “Caught red-handed, huh? Do you really like me that much?”
 

 
“You…”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at her mischievous smile and knew exactly what she was thinking.
 

 
It was impossible to make her stop, so he could only helplessly laugh and hug her: “What’s the next development supposed to be? Director Tong, give me some guidance. Are we heading to the 'chasing wife cremation ground'? I haven’t chased anyone before. Teach me, and cut me some slack.”
 

 
“‘Chasing wife cremation ground,’ seriously.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed heartily.
 

 
She couldn’t understand why this guy had so many words that hit her sore spots!
 

 
Han Zhi, defending himself after listening to her complaints, said with justification: “Because I’m a writer.”
 

 
“Well, the Chinese literary world is fortunate to have you. It’ll be doomed sooner or later.”
 

 
Tong Zhao issued a dismal missive to the literary world.
 

 
Han Zhi thought this woman was great in every way except for her foul mouth. Deciding to take action, he lowered his head and kissed her lips. The kiss was intense and hard to part from, but at that moment, the director switched the camera.
 

 
[……Director, no more chicken legs for you tonight!]
 

 
[Where’s the director’s Weibo? Everyone, flood it with complaints!]
 

 
[Reasonably suspecting this is a scam to get VIP members to buy the cut version viewing rights. You think we’ll fall for it? Others might not know, but I’ve been duped. Crying while recharging for this King of Sea couple/Smile/Smile]
 

 
The camera cut to just outside the game room, where they encountered He Shun.
 

 
“Tong Zhao, are you avoiding me?”
 

 
He quickly stepped forward, grabbing Tong Zhao's hand with a voice full of confusion and anxiety.
 

 
The audience, who had been angrily cursing the director, instantly had their attention diverted—
 

 
This was definitely a chaotic scene!
 

 
Had things gone off the rails?
 

 
How would Tong Zhao handle it?
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her captured wrist. Although she didn’t struggle to provoke him, her inner voice was already cursing him out: [Crazy. Why not just talk if you want to? Why grab me?]
 

 
The production team remained unmoved and even found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
With Han Zhi’s previous example, the crew had already realized that ordinary people couldn’t handle these two sea kings. A few words were enough to appease them, almost at a level of brainwashing worthy of a multi-level marketing leader. If their views weren’t so warped, developing a harem might not be out of the question.
 

 
Assistant director: “The highlight should be the sea kings teaching how to establish a harem, right?”
 

 
“He Shun is no match for Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“It’s hard to say. He Shun is obviously a very possessive man. Chang Xiao Nian has gained confidence and self-awareness under Han Zhi’s influence, and her infatuation with him has faded. This allows her to remain calm about his pursuit of other female players,” the screenwriter analyzed, convincing others.
 

 
Just as everyone behind the scenes and the audience were convinced that Tong Zhao could easily handle He Shun, she did not resort to her usual tactics of softening, acting cute, or feigning distress. Instead, she narrowed her eyes coldly and said, “Avoid you?”
 

 
He Shun did not notice her unusual expression and questioned her with a sense of righteous indignation: “You haven’t talked to me since the end of the class. I wanted to find you, but you were always with that rich young man. I didn’t have a chance to talk to you. If it weren’t for following you... never mind, that’s not the point. You owe me an explanation. Also, what were you doing in the game room with him?”
 

 
Before their relationship was defined, He Shun had already shown a strong sense of control over his “little girlfriend.”
 

 
Having tidied up the board game toys and preparing to leave, Han Zhi was called out just as he was about to step out the door. His handsome face showed an awkward expression, like he’d stepped on his tail, which was quite amusing.
 

 
The camera pulled back, capturing all three of them in the frame, creating a scene reminiscent of an idol drama’s chaotic moment.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Ah, this...]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Let's observe for now. If there’s any violent behavior, I’ll need to protect the queen.]
 

 
[So good at acting, Brother Zhi!]
 

 
[I think he just wants to annoy Sister Zhao. Clearly, she doesn’t like being called 'queen' by him, haha...]
 

 
[These two are hilarious, jumping from a restricted scene straight into a comedy.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Sigh, I hope Tong Zhao performs normally and I don’t have to step in.]
 

 
Immediately, Tong Zhao took action to show him that not only was she performing well, but she was also exceeding expectations.
 

 
She looked at He Shun with a calm demeanor, a mix of novelty and pity.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly.
 

 
"Do you think you’re worthy to boss me around?"
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao’s thoughts and spoken words matched in their cold and arrogant tone.
 

 
He Shun clearly didn’t expect this side of his delicate and fragile goddess, and he was left stunned by her previously obsequious and now contemptuous attitude. Tong Zhao observed his expression for a moment—
 

 
She and Han Zhi were clearly not on the same path. Han Zhi would never treat his suitors like this, and as for the imperial concubine? Apart from being the supreme ruler, everyone else was only fit to kneel and serve her: "Alright, for humanitarian reasons, I’ll let you die understanding the truth. I’m already fed up with your self-praise while tutoring students and your visible disdain for women. Every time you criticize those two women, I almost throw up."
 

 
"But," He Shun struggled to accept, "I was just speaking the truth."
 

 
"Ah, consider this a free lesson from me. Listening to you is like putting money in your pocket. Criticizing other women in front of your beloved? Do you think I’d be pleased? No, I’d just think you’re of low class."
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t have much liking for the other two female players either.
 

 
The "true self" of Concubine Chen had always been forged in the palace’s fierce struggles, with competitors of the same sex deeply ingrained in her subconscious. This was her extreme and one-sided part. But for someone like He Shun…
 

 
What to say?
 

 
It was like a eunuch pointing fingers at the concubines—no matter if the target was just an occasional attendant, the concubine still wanted to give him a good kick, sending him to the torture chamber; it was a matter of principle.
 

 
Taking advantage of He Shun’s shock, Tong Zhao freed her wrist from his grip and rubbed her delicate white wrist.
 

 
She had basically concluded that Wei Zekai was the judge, and at worst, someone with the last name Chang or Zhong, though it was unlikely. If it were Chang Xiaonian’s doing, she probably would have reported her name in the app by now. Based on her observations over the past few days, He Shun’s behavior didn’t seem like that of someone holding a special identity card.
 

 
“Do you remember what you said to me? Chang Xiaonian’s desire to marry into a rich family is too obvious; no man would like such a materialistic woman. Zhong Muxi’s looks are average and too gloomy, and at her age, she should be doing more housework to show herself, otherwise, she’ll waste her whole life.”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao paused: [Does saying this make it seem like I’m venting on their behalf?]
 

 
This thought hit her sore spot, causing goosebumps to rise on her arm.
 

 
[Imagining Concubine Chen defending her sisters in the harem hahahaha]
 

 
[ Let me touch her face!]
 

 
[Director: The character setting has collapsed!]
 

 
Never mind how others interpret it. Seeing the men’s worldviews crumbling, she couldn’t help but mock him with a delighted expression: “Do you think you can control everything and have already handled me? Let me give you a piece of advice: treating all women as fools will only make you look like a bigger fool.”
 

 
The offensive language was toned down.
 

 
But from Tong Zhao’s tone and expression, the audience perfectly received the message she intended to convey.
 

 
He Shun, realizing he had been fooled, was enraged: “You… you deliberately approached me to mislead me! I treated you so well, and now I will expose you to others. As long as the judge knows your true colors, you’re out of the game!”
 

 
“Yes, indeed,”
 

 
After laying it all out, Tong Zhao’s smile didn’t fade. She took a step forward and asked softly, “So, who do you think will believe you? Is it Wei Zekai, who has climbed to twenty stars with me in duo mode, or those two girls you look down on? Do you really think they haven’t noticed your disdain for them? Fool, playing this kind of game without building good relationships and exchanging information with others, it’s quite laughable.”
 

 
He Shun’s expression stiffened.
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
He looked down on those two women, and their relationship with him was also weak.
 

 
They politely addressed him as ‘Teacher He’ on the surface. During their last event, they almost had a fight. He kindly advised Chang Xiaonian to be more practical and not live in her own world, but she was ungrateful and said it was her own business.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In love, isolating yourself is the worst mistake.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In tactics, belittle the enemy, but in strategy, respect them... Sigh, though I can’t really criticize him for this. In the realm of same-sex relationships, my connections are either cold or antagonistic.]
 

 
She pouted.
 

 
The comments flooded with female fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Ah, they really like Sister Zhao!
 

 
He Shun, unable to tolerate it any longer, swung his arm to give her a piece of his mind. Observing from behind, Han Zhi couldn’t stay still and quickly stepped in to block He Shun’s raised hand. Tong Zhao, completely expecting this, sarcastically addressed Han Zhi from behind him: “So you’re getting all worked up just because I hit a nerve? Do you want to fight? I’m sending Han Zhi to handle you!”
 

 
She was almost about to say, “Pikachu, I choose you!”…
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips twitched.
 

 
This woman’s genuinely unpleasant personality always made him unable to suppress a smile.
 

 
Upon seeing Han Zhi, He Shun’s assumptions and suspicions quickly connected.
 

 
His pride and self-esteem wavered as he cursed, “...What a pair of dog-men and women!”
 

 
With that, He Shun shook off Han Zhi’s restraint and stormed out.
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been scolded, turned to the cause of the trouble: “Isn’t it easy to smooth things over with him? Why bother?”
 

 
“Difficult, extremely difficult,” Tong Zhao shook his hand playfully, acting spoiled: “It’s nearly impossible for me to hold back from giving him a scolding. Oh my god, did you see how he came to question me—why should I put up with it? He’s not even my boyfriend and thinks he has any authority over me.”
 

 
Han Zhi nodded in understanding: “Sounds very infuriating.”
 

 
When it comes to infuriating people, Tong Zhao is truly a master at provoking hatred.
 

 
However, Han Zhi strangely had little empathy for men. It was as if he was born to think from a woman’s perspective, only wanting to protect the girls' interests.
 

 
Tong Zhao noticed his skepticism and raised her right hand for him to see: “Look, my wrist is red from where he grabbed me.”
 

 
Indeed, there were red marks on her fair wrist from where He Shun had grabbed her. Her pale skin made the bruises even more conspicuous.
 

 
The Empress had never been subjected to such grievances and immediately showed her displeasure.
 

 
Seeing the girl’s wrist injured, Han Zhi’s already limited sympathy turned into genuine concern for Tong Zhao. He sighed, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to get some medicine.”
 

 
“But you have to cooperate with me in the act,” Tong Zhao pressed on.
 

 
Han Zhi knew she was likely to bruise easily but also recognized she was genuinely upset, so he indulged her: “Alright, as a seasoned actor, I’ll play along with whatever you need.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, pleased with the response.
 

 
At the time, no one expected that this would turn out to be a prophetic statement.
 

 
Returning to the current situation:
 

 
He Shun was furious, his anger making him stomp heavily with each step.
 

 
He had feelings for Tong Zhao, an elevated admiration, slightly pleased by this little beauty’s admiration of him. He enjoyed making her dance around him and was thrilled with even the smallest favors. He had never expected that she was actually deceiving him the entire time!
 

 
He was confident that he would not become prey to the “sea king.”
 

 
It was just a woman’s trick.
 

 
In the presence of an experienced and successful man like him, he could see through such things at a glance.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so well-behaved, unable to hide anything from him, her face easily reddening.
 

 
It was probably that ambitious woman who got the female Sea King card! Unfortunately, he was a man she could never control. The young and impulsive Wei Zekai might have a chance, but He Shun had little regard for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
However, however...
 

 
He Shun’s mind was in complete disarray.
 

 
Viewers of variety shows instinctively love moments of genuine emotion, whether it involves someone’s misfortune or not. It feels authentic and engaging. It’s like some old American reality shows, which often staged dramatic confrontations and outbursts in front of the camera, airing crass lines that would make educated and respectable people cringe, yet still managed high ratings.
 

 
No matter how civilized the times become, the public’s appetite for drama remains unchanged.
 

 
He Shun walked into the public area of the lounge.
 

 
Wei Zekai was nowhere to be found, and the two girls were watching TV.
 

 
He was somewhat displeased, assuming that Wei Zekai was hiding away to play games again, missing in crucial moments. However, on second thought, having only the two girls was not so bad. They seemed to have always disliked Tong Zhao. He once overheard Chang Xiaonian call Tong Zhao a "green tea."
 

 
He Shun approached them and, with a serious demeanor and a determined tone, made a shocking revelation:
 

 
“Tong Zhao is the sea king among us. She deceived my feelings!”
 

 
……
 

 
………
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi, sitting closely on a small sofa, looked up at He Shun.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not talkative, but Chang Xiaonian couldn’t hide her confusion and curiosity: “Huh?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Are we even that close?]
 

 
Tong Zhao was right; their relationship was not good at all.
 

 
The identity of the female sea king did not threaten the interests of the two girls.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought it was rather foolish for a man like He Shun to seek their help to seek justice after being emotionally hurt.
 

 
Not only did she not sympathize, but she also found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
[Doesn’t he look down on women a lot? How can he be deceived by a woman and then seek help from another woman?] Chang Xiaonian’s inner thoughts voiced a portion of the audience’s sentiment: [What does it have to do with me? Help, every time he speaks, it just makes Brother Zhi look even better. I hope my future boyfriend isn’t like this guy, please.]
 

 
If He Shun had arrived a bit earlier, Chang Xiaonian might have shared his antagonism.
 

 
After all, in many black-and-white online novels and short videos, green tea bitches and white lotus flowers are universally condemned.
 

 
However, after receiving Brother Zhi’s care, she had become more forgiving towards flowers and plants. She felt a bit embarrassed about her previous behavior of gossiping behind Tong Zhao’s back. Although she couldn’t apologize directly, at least she didn’t feel the impulse to join in the bashing when others tried to slander Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Don’t you understand this at all?”
 

 
Although He Shun was already aware that women typically react slower than men, he was still a bit impatient: “She intentionally seduced me and then revealed her true colors after I confessed to her…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked with curiosity: “What exactly are these true colors?”
 

 
He Shun, enraged, replied: “She rejected me!”
# Chapter46
Chang Xiaonian mumbled, "... Oh."
 

 
He Shun sighed in relief, "Do you understand now?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian didn't really understand.
 

 
If it were one of her close friends, even if the confession was rejected by a man and she knew everyone had the right to refuse, she would still help her friend by cursing out the guy to let off steam, and only after she calmed down would she offer advice.
 

 
But He Shun...
 

 
He's someone she has no real connection with!
 

 
Moreover, didn't He Shun seem quite confident last time? He told her to be clear-headed, saying that if a girl wants to find a partner, she needs to learn to actively do housework, otherwise, no one would want her, and then he eagerly went to be a tool for Tong Zhao. And now he got rejected? Serves him right for being so narrow-minded!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no intention of defending him.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn't catch on as quickly; she seemed a bit slow and continued to be puzzled, "Why is getting rejected a sign of being a sea king? Maybe she just doesn't like you?"
 

 
"She was leading me on and misleading me!"
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked, "What specific actions misled you?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian suddenly remembered that this friend of hers was a science prodigy and also a bit rigid.
 

 
He Shun argued indignantly, "Whatever I did, she praised me and would blush when talking to me."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Blushing, what a sophisticated fishing tactic!]
 

 
"Teacher He," Zhong Muxi asked with even more confusion, "I remember you were tutoring her. Isn’t it normal for a student to praise the teacher? As for blushing, that’s just blushing. Is there any more convincing evidence? With the way you spoke just now, I thought she at least mentioned liking you or something similar.”
 

 
[Don’t ask anymore, He Shun is getting anxious.]
 

 
[Is this the power of a straight woman?]
 

 
[I’m already starting to feel embarrassed for He Shun. I hope his business partners don’t see this episode.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi sighed, "If there's no verbal evidence, do you have any actual progress in your relationship? Have you hugged, held hands, or kissed?"
 

 
"No, but..."
 

 
He Shun opened his mouth to argue.
 

 
However, under the barrage of questioning, he not only stuttered but also suddenly realized deep down—
 

 
Yes, Tong Zhao had never made any promises to him.
 

 
Why had he always been so sure that she was interested in him? Moreover, with his experience, he knew that attraction between men and women before establishing a relationship is unreliable; you might be into each other one day and indifferent the next.
 

 
[The empress knows how to see through people’s intentions.]
 

 
[Her previous analysis of He Shun was spot on.]
 

 
Noticing the shift in the comments, the special effects team timely inserted a previous psychological analysis by Tong Zhao regarding He Shun:
 

 
[He Shun is a man overflowing with confidence who looks down on women, believing that women are naturally inferior to him in terms of physiology, psychology, and intelligence. It’s easy to handle someone with this mindset. People who treat others as fools in interpersonal relationships are the most likely to end up with a big fall.]
 

 
[He’s arrogant, so he magnified the feelings I showed.]
 

 
[He looks down on women, so he thinks I can't escape his grasp.]
 

 
[It would be best if he develops a complex about women and stops putting on a show in front of them.]
 

 
The last comment had the audience in stitches.
 

 
At this moment, Han Zhi hurriedly walked into the living room and asked, "Where’s the first aid kit?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stood up, "I’ll get it for you. What happened?"
 

 
He Shun’s irritation flared up.
 

 
Just now, when he was talking to Chang Xiaonian, she was cold and indifferent.
 

 
He Shun thought Chang Xiaonian was just pretending to be aloof, as she acted the same way with all men. But then she was so attentive to Han Zhi...
 

 
Recalling how Tong Zhao had shown off behind Han Zhi, He Shun was consumed with jealousy: “Now you’re just her lapdog? I’m telling you, that woman isn’t so simple. Don’t let yourself be used without even realizing it.”
 

 
[Although you’re confident when pointing fingers at girls, your powerless rage looks really pathetic.]
 

 
[I love the literary genius of the comments.]
 

 
[Handsome men and beautiful women are a match made in heaven, and it’s ridiculous for you to oppose it!]
 

 
After finding the first aid kit, Han Zhi finally looked at He Shun, his eyes cold and frosty:
 

 
"Just because she rejected your confession, you want to resort to violence? If helping her find medicine is exploitation, then I’m willing to do it."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just finished playing a game and came out to watch, heard this and asked, "Who got hurt?"
 

 
"I saw He Shun confessing to Tong Zhao in the hallway. After she rejected him, he wouldn’t let her leave, and her wrist ended up with a large bruise."
 

 
Han Zhi spoke clearly and logically. He generally got along well with everyone, and even Zhong Muxi, who was most resistant to men, thought he was a good man. When he spoke, the scales of reason naturally tipped in his favor.
 

 
"I didn’t lay a hand on her!"
 

 
He Shun denied it.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pale-faced Tong Zhao walked out from the hallway leading to the game room.
 

 
It was unclear how she managed to make her face look so pale.
 

 
Earlier, when she had been mocking He Shun, her complexion was rosy and healthy, as if she had had a little to drink.
 

 
Han Zhi ignored his explanation. After Tong Zhao sat down on the sofa farthest from He Shun, he took out some ointment and applied it to her. Everyone could clearly see that there was a red mark on Tong Zhao’s wrist, evidently caused by someone grabbing her too hard.
 

 
He Shun’s face instantly turned dark.
 

 
He had indeed held her hand for a while...
 

 
But was it really that hard?
 

 
He wasn’t sure.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who looked delicate and used to pretending to be pitiful, now sat quietly on the sofa with her long lashes casting shadows over her bright eyes. She lowered her head, exposing a slender, pale neck that, like her arms and legs, seemed fragile and easy to break. Honestly, when she was quiet, she fit the straight male fantasy of pure and weak, easily controllable.
 

 
She was so beautiful and delicate, like a porcelain doll, that it evoked a flood of sympathy from the audience who were fans of attractive people.
 

 
Even Chang Xiaonian, who generally had a neutral opinion of Tong Zhao, couldn’t hold back: “Acting out after a failed confession, you’re the one revealing your true colors!”
 

 
He Shun’s lack of communication skills was glaringly exposed.
 

 
The director displayed the approval panel; He Shun’s approval rating had dropped to only 10.
 

 
It was roughly at the level of “if something bad happened to him, people might still send flowers in sympathy, but they don’t want to interact with him any further and find him annoying.”
 

 
He Shun’s disdain for others didn’t mean he wanted to be a public figure.
 

 
Feeling the strange looks from everyone, he anxiously explained, “I was just so angry at the time, and I didn’t hit her. I was just afraid she would run away and not listen to me properly. It wasn’t that serious! Right, it must be fake, like with blush or lipstick…”
 

 
[Next, He Shun will perform a segment of “The More You Explain, The Worse It Gets.”]
 

 
[Will he really find a girlfriend after this show airs? Just asking.]
 

 
[Maybe. I’ve heard he’s quite wealthy and not bad-looking among rich people.]
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, poured more ointment, and applied it to the wound.
 

 
There was no sign of the bruise spreading.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [His understanding of women is shockingly shallow and stereotypical.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi: [I need to stay away from him in the future.]
 

 
“Did you hurt your hand? Is it serious?” Wei Zekai ran down the stairs from the second floor, squatted beside Tong Zhao, and examined her injury with concern. This action surprised the audience, especially the two playboys and added weight to the notion that “Tong Zhao genuinely likes him,” which annoyed Han Zhi a bit.
 

 
[Wei Zekai is awakening? The Wei-Zhao faction is ecstatic!]
 

 
[Not bad, the younger brother is making progress.]
 

 
However, the AI's analysis quickly shattered the audience’s illusions:
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Injured your hand? Will it affect your performance? Damn, He’s caused a lot of harm.]
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……………]
 

 
The comments were filled with ellipses.
 

 
Wei Zekai, a man who silenced the comments!
 

 
Seeing his malicious assumptions crumble on their own, He Shun became increasingly flustered in his defense: “Why are you all looking at me like that? I didn’t do it on purpose. How was I supposed to know she was so fragile? I swear I really didn’t mean to hurt her. If I had intended to, it wouldn’t just be a bruise on her wrist. Can I just apologize? I’m sorry!”
 

 
As he spoke, He Shun became more agitated.
 

 
He genuinely believed he was in the right.
 

 
The mistake was misjudging Tong Zhao; he didn’t expect her to be such a malicious woman.
 

 
He merely held someone’s hand while talking for a moment, and now it’s his fault that her wrist is bruised? He feels incredibly unlucky.
 

 
He was innocent but fell victim to a bad woman. It’s truly unfortunate.
 

 
People who are arrogant can’t hide their emotions, and his insincere apology only further diminished any goodwill.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s injury was not serious; if He Shun had apologized with a good attitude, people would have calmed down and understood it objectively. But instead, he made things worse by exposing his problematic mindset while trying to explain.
 

 
He genuinely believed that injuring a wrist didn’t count as hitting someone.
 

 
Tong Zhao should be thankful that he didn’t actually intend to hit her.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was fuming.
 

 
But she felt that her relationship with Tong Zhao wasn’t close enough to defend her.
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, couldn’t listen any longer.
 

 
“Are you done yet? Why should Tong Zhao listen to you? If she doesn’t want to hear what you have to say, maybe you should reflect on whether you’re just talking nonsense. Ok, if you want an answer, she rejected you! It’s straightforward and clear. Or do you not understand human language? Do we need to send you a dream to explain it? Fine, if that’s what it takes, people from the underworld can handle such things.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was a young master known for his prowess in various online games.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t have the face to scold him, but Wei Zekai did so without hesitation.
 

 
If it weren’t for the invisible force (the system tries to prevent guests from saying restricted lines) holding him back, He Shun’s family tree might have already started facing trouble.
 

 
After being berated by someone he viewed as just a pampered kid from a wealthy family, He Shun angrily retorted, “What’s it to you!”
 

 
“You injured her hand, so of course it concerns me!”
 

 
He Shun yelled, but Wei Zekai yelled even louder.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao already suspected about 50% of the reason behind Wei Zekai’s fury, but to keep up the act, she still showed Han Zhi a somewhat smug smile, resembling a pampered little princess.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mind was as quick as his speech: [Damn it, Tong Zhao’s hand shouldn’t be hurt. That’s the hand used to coordinate with me to take down the opponents!]
 

 
“What did I say wrong? Are you angry because your confession failed? Didn’t you injure her hand?”
 

 
He Shun thought about it and realized that the young master was probably right.
 

 
“I’m not angry because of embarrassment; I’ve seen through her true nature. I didn’t expect all of you to be deceived by her,” He Shun said with deep disappointment, looking at the two girls. The two men had become nothing more than Tong Zhao’s lapdogs in his eyes. He added another gem of wisdom: “If you want to maintain your dignity, you shouldn’t be on her side. Good girls should draw a clear line from that kind of person!”
 

 
This was clearly stirring up trouble.
 

 
But it was also He Shun’s honest opinion.
 

 
He wasn’t a woman-hater; in fact, he liked and needed women very much.
 

 
But what he liked were good women.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously been seen by He Shun as the ideal obedient girl, while Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were too lacking in femininity and didn’t satisfy a man’s sense of self-esteem. However, it now seemed that Tong Zhao was the most unforgivable bad woman!
 

 
He hoped the two girls would wake up and realize that they shouldn’t blindly support their own gender.
 

 
Just like those women who say, “Although I’m a woman too, I think blabla…”—that’s the kind of clear-headed and sensible girl in his eyes.
 

 
Such a classic idea that can provoke gender conflicts was fully displayed to the audience.
 

 
Reality shows are just this authentic.
 

 
The more controversial the topic, the fewer celebrities are willing to appear on the show.
 

 
The same goes for ordinary people.
 

 
Fortunately, there are many people in China, so with such a large pool, it’s always possible to find suitable guests.
 

 
He Shun thought his subconscious must be as mature and wise as he is, full of male charm.
 

 
He didn’t think he would cause any public relations crisis—
 

 
After all, his views and thoughts are in line with mainstream society.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was a bit overwhelmed by being yelled at by a man and moved closer to her friend.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian glanced at him disdainfully: “Crazy.”
 

 
After saying that, she dragged her friend upstairs, clearly unwilling to get involved.
 

 
With Young Master Wei Zekai protecting her, there was no need for them to rush to defend Tong Zhao. However, He Shun’s irritating nature was fully displayed. They decided to avoid him in the future to prevent him from “accidentally” bruising someone’s hand because he wanted them to stop and listen to him.
 

 
After He Shun threw his tantrum and was ignored, he left in a huff.
 

 
Han Zhi finished applying the ointment, confirmed that Tong Zhao didn’t need anything else, and then left.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt sorry for his teammate and sat down next to her to comfort her: “Does your hand still hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes and spoke softly: “A little.”
 

 
“I see,” Wei Zekai said with great concern, “Does that mean you can’t play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
She had guessed correctly.
 

 
So the guy’s anger earlier was because his duo queue partner was out of commission.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were a guy, she’d be fine now, but his heart would be aching.
 

 
Who wouldn’t have a tough time trying to win over Wei Zekai’s heart?
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Retreating in the face of difficulty doesn’t fit my aesthetics. Go for it, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
Tong Zhao pouted: “You only care about the game, and I’m not important at all?”
 

 
“How could that be?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t stand being misunderstood.
 

 
He suddenly placed his hands on her shoulders, looked intently into her eyes, and said:
 

 
“You’re an important teammate to me!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [……]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can’t keep this up. Just let it be destroyed!]
 

 
Tong Zhao steadied herself and gathered her thoughts.
 

 
Wei Zekai, being a young guy, needed a gradual approach. She couldn’t be too hasty: “You can play games. It doesn’t affect anything. Do you want to play now? We can go to your room.”
 

 
“My room?” Wei Zekai was puzzled.
 

 
“I’m afraid of seeing him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her head, looking like an adorable, aggrieved little thing.
 

 
Wei Zekai understood and accepted the suggestion to go to his room, and he patted his chest, reassuring her: “Don’t worry, with me around, that old man wouldn’t dare lay a finger on you!”
 

 
Tong Zhao realized he wasn’t impressed by being admired, so she skipped the grateful look.
 

 
This fool, it’s already good enough that she didn’t give him a disdainful glance.
 

 
※
 

 
When they arrived at the estate, Wei Zekai, the super-rich second-generation who had criticized the shabby estate, had no qualms about choosing the best suite. Although Tong Zhao didn’t look around, she had quietly observed with her peripheral vision and indeed noticed some clues.
 

 
The dog hair left on the floor was clearly from that little dog.
 

 
“Your room seems bigger than mine. Is the bedroom the same?”
 

 
“Why don’t you go check?”
 

 
Each suite had its own small living room, bathroom, and bedroom.
 

 
With the owner’s permission, Tong Zhao glanced into the bedroom and indeed found noticeable golden-brown dog hair on the white bed sheets.
 

 
“I’ll go wash my face and clear my head,” Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sprawling out on the living room sofa, nodded to show he heard her.
 

 
The bathroom also had traces of dog hair.
 

 
Not having a dog was indeed a lie from Wei Zekai.
 

 
But there were no sounds of dogs in the room—
 

 
Unless specially trained, it’s rare for dogs not to bark when a stranger enters the room. At least for small dogs, their tolerance in this aspect… maybe it’s Tong Zhao’s prejudice, but having been barked at by Pomeranians and Chihuahuas before, she thought corgis couldn’t control themselves.
 

 
An immature idea gradually took shape in Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
As usual, she played games with Kai Wei, but her frequency of speaking was much higher than before.
 

 
“Where is their jungler?”
 

 
“He should be taking his own red buff.”
 

 
“What skills did the enemy use in the last team fight?”
 

 
“The ADC used Cleanse.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao’s questions weren’t complicated, some were simple enough to answer without much thought.
 

 
With the continuous high frequency of questions, Wei Zekai gradually developed a reflexive response.
 

 
Finally, when the timing seemed right, Tong Zhao asked, “What about that little dog?”
 
“It’s playing the game with you.”
 
……
 

 
[Psychology Master, I bow to your wisdom!]
 

 
[Seriously? This works? Is Wei Zekai’s IQ all used up for playing games?]
 

 
[Impressed by the devotion, haha]
 

 
Tong Zhao subconsciously felt that this tactic was effective on him.
 

 
It definitely wouldn’t work on Han Zhi.
 

 
After hearing the answer, Tong Zhao fell silent.
 

 
Realizing what he had said, Wei Zekai's hand shook, not only did he misfire his ultimate, but he also inadvertently punished the ADC’s cannon, receiving a frustrated question mark from the ADC: “Damn, I didn’t hear clearly just now. What dog? I don’t know… Hey, can you control the enemy mid-laner? They keep messing around in my jungle!”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t press the issue any further.
 

 
She had a premonition that, given Wei Zekai’s thought process, the real reason behind things might be much stranger than she imagined.
 

 
For this private gathering, Tong Zhao's progress: She reached six stars in the game.
 

 
Meanwhile, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were discussing the afternoon’s incident with a sigh.
 

 
“Even if Tong Zhao really is a sea king… I suspect she has a lot to do with it. After all, Xiao Xi, you’re not, and I’m not, so it must be her!” Chang Xiaonian analyzed confidently, “Anyway, it’s not our business. That guy He Shun’s behavior is just too ugly. He deserves to be played around with; hitting a woman is simply unforgivable!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi, hugging a pillow, softly agreed: “I don’t like He Shun.”
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi defend Tong Zhao made Chang Xiaonian feel a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
But then she realized it was just part of the official task.
 

 
Zhong Muxi worriedly asked her: “By the way, are you okay? It seems like Wei Zekai has a good relationship with Tong Zhao…”
 

 
She knew her close friend had always been fond of Wei Zekai.
 

 
Whether it was for money or if she was materialistic was not something she considered.
 

 
She was concerned about her friend's feelings.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was taken aback but then waved her hand: “I’ve long stopped liking him! This time I’m not getting involved in the activity, but I’m quite happy.”
 

 
Even though she hadn’t found a suitable partner, she had experienced a sweet and dreamy romance.
 

 
She was very satisfied!
 

 
“That’s good.” Zhong Muxi felt relieved.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian looked at her friend intently.
 

 
In theory, she should remind her that Han Zhi is that sea king.
 

 
But considering Zhong Muxi’s many old injuries…
 

 
Recently, she had been keeping a close eye on her, eating and sleeping together. When Xiao Xi lost control of her emotions, she would cry on her shoulder, which helped control her self-harming urges. But she couldn’t be with her forever… Maybe Han Zhi could do what she couldn’t.
 

 
Forget it, let’s observe for now.
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi were like parallel lines; aside from being forced together during a game of Truth or Dare, they had no intersecting points.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was quite curious about how he would make his move.
 

 
But he seemed unaffected.
 

 
And in this estate, there was someone else who was also concerned about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It wasn’t Han Zhi, it was Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had vowed to stop being a lapdog, but he continued to pay attention to the crying, self-harming girl. He thought if something similar happened again, he’d swoop in and take away her fruit knife—he had practiced jumping many times in his room for this, truly an elite among dogs.
 

 
After He Shun was isolated, the atmosphere in the estate became a bit strange.
 

 
People with sensitive and fragile mental states are most easily affected. Although it wasn’t Zhong Muxi’s fault, her condition continued to deteriorate day by day. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t do much about it and had to leave it to Han Zhi to figure out a solution.
 

 
Han Zhi was surprised: “You’re creating opportunities for me to pursue your friend?”
 

 
“To make her happy,” Chang Xiaonian corrected him, “I’m involved too, so don’t mess things up.”
 

 
Han Zhi was a bit surprised, then touched her head: “Why does it seem like you’re doing better and better after leaving me?”
 

 
“It’s always been this way; it’s too late to regret now.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian accepted his praise calmly and hummed a happy tune.
 

 
Under her matchmaking, the three of them frequently spent time together.
 

 
He Shun saw this and felt he had once again misjudged— not only was Tong Zhao a schemer, but even Han Zhi, who he had thought well of before, was just another pretty boy spinning around women. And those two girls were even more foolish.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was surprised that Han Zhi didn’t enjoy having two women accompany him as much as He Shun imagined.
 

 
He came up with some entertainment activities but invited Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao to join.
 

 
Under the condition of “mutual support,” Tong Zhao reluctantly attended.
 

 
Han Zhi’s strategy was effective; Zhong Muxi’s smile gradually increased.
 

 
One time, after swimming in the pool and feeling tired, the three girls sat by the poolside, sipping on the frozen juice Han Zhi had prepared in advance, and chatted idly. Zhong Muxi said enviously, “Han Zhi is amazing, he has everything prepared. I’m almost embarrassed.”
 

 
“What’s there to be embarrassed about?”
 

 
The favored concubine, who saw all men as tools, looked at her in confusion.
 

 
Since distancing herself from He Shun’s male chauvinism, Tong Zhao had increasingly revealed her true nature in front of everyone. Her hand, which would never heal, was taken care of by Wei Zekai, who accepted that girls were more delicate and helped her with tea and water, after all, she was an injured comrade, and it was right to take care of her!
 

 
After several gatherings, Chang Xiaonian had a good understanding of what Tong Zhao was like.
 

 
She was basically a princess with a disorder.
 

 
The green tea act was fake, and she didn’t like to speak ill of other girls.
 

 
She looked at Tong Zhao with considerable patience.
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao belatedly remembered her mission as a supporting role and reluctantly added, “If you’re embarrassed, next time you can prepare things together with him.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian questioned, “What about you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied very calmly, “I have a hand injury.”
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao flashed a delicate smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile was beautiful, but Chang Xiaonian read the underlying message from it—
 

 
"Expect me to do the work? Not gonna happen."
 

 
How could someone use such a beautiful face to maintain this "I’m too delicate to handle hard work" attitude!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned by her shamelessness.
 

 
For a moment, she was speechless, losing her ability to talk.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t notice the underlying tension in their conversation; she thought Tong Zhao had a point.
 

 
Although she didn’t want to be a caretaker for men, she was willing to join in on the preparations. She vaguely sensed that these gatherings were arranged for her, and she felt grateful but also wanted to contribute something for everyone.
 

 
[Oh no, Xiao Xi is such a good girl, Brother Zhi, go save her!]
 

 
[So obedient...]
 

 
[To spoil the mood, this kind of thinking can easily lead to the favored concubine bossing her around…]
 

 
The audience before the live broadcast fell silent for a moment.
 

 
Everyone has a dark side; even saints acknowledge actions over intentions.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows are all about intentions, so the public is generally more forgiving of guests’ performances as long as they are interesting and engaging! Even in instinctive films, Xu Zhu was criticized not for her selfish nature but for her inability to secure a role and almost derailing the plot by causing a key character's death. She wasn’t condemned to leave the entertainment industry just because of her inherent flaws.
 

 
Tong Zhao's princess syndrome was similarly accepted.
 

 
Of course, some people disliked it, but others found it endearing.
 

 
Anyway, the audience wasn’t the ones being used as tools!
 

 
There were also male viewers willing to be the tool for the beautiful sister.
 

 
And some people even felt vicariously pleased.
 

 
The variety of opinions played out on the screen.
 

 
Before the next gathering, Zhong Muxi indeed proposed joining in on the preparation work, and Han Zhi gladly agreed.
 

 
He also slowly built rapport with Zhong Muxi in his own way—
 

 
Zhong Muxi was like a shy little hedgehog, even more so than Chang Xiaonian, requiring patience.
 

 
He had to take it slow, being a patient hunter.
# Chapter47
The afternoon sunlight gently bathed the grass.
 

 
The well-trimmed lawn was gilded with a layer of gold, beautiful like an oil painting. And Tong Zhao, wearing a straw hat and well-applied sunscreen, was the main character of this oil painting. She was also very aware of her role, and after tasting each of the hot dishes, salads, and desserts her friend had prepared, she began to give her feedback:
 

 
“This sweet and sour spareribs and potato-braised beef brisket are quite good, though the spareribs could be a bit sweeter.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian coolly remarked, “If you want it sweeter, you can make it yourself.”
 

 
“But mine doesn’t taste as good as Muxi’s,” Tong Zhao said, speaking very kindly to the well-trained butler number two, Zhong Muxi. With a soft voice and clasped hands, she pleaded, “Muxi’s cooking is the best. My hands hurt, so I can't hold the pot, and I’ve never learned to cook. Thankfully, you’re here. I wouldn’t know what to do without you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Your hands hurting my foot!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian felt sick just looking at her.
 

 
But with such a pleasant attitude and flattery in every sentence, Zhong Muxi, who had a thin skin, blushed with embarrassment and looked quite pleased. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t say anything more and had to console herself – at least Tong Zhao knew not to be pushy about getting a free ride.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was still naïve.
 

 
When the relationship became truly familiar, the imperial consort could show off with an air of authority.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The training of a butler is subtle and imperceptible, like a silent influence.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [At first, they just prepared my portion and received compliments. Then, they were asked to make dishes according to my preferences, and now they know my tastes without me saying anything... Not bad!]
 

 
[I suddenly understand how my cat pua-ed me.]
 

 
[This litter-scooping officer is crying.]
 

 
[Congratulations to Miss Muxi for getting a cat master!]
 

 
[The only sane and normal person on the scene might be Miss Chang…]
 

 
Blushing from the compliments, Zhong Muxi hurriedly lowered her head and said quietly, “If you like it, I’ll add more sugar next time.”
 

 
Humans are social animals.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not a cold and solitary type. After being abandoned by a man and resisting male company, she craved a sense of security in friendships more than most girls. The pain of being dumped largely comes from being rejected and betrayed by those closest to you, with original hopes and plans torn up and thrown away, leaving the abandoned party helplessly facing memories.
 

 
Tong Zhao provided her with generous and affirming recognition.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian watched her and felt silently sick.
 

 
“Ah, I’m done drinking.” After finishing the last sip of mango juice, Tong Zhao looked dejected.
 

 
“Would you like more mango juice, or should we try something else?”
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi had made many freshly squeezed fruit juices and put them in the fridge.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m getting a bit tired of mango juice; I want watermelon juice.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took the empty cup to the kitchen to rinse it and set it aside to dry. Then, she took out the watermelon juice from the fridge and, the moment she placed it in front of Tong Zhao, it felt like a jolt in her brain — [Oh no, what am I doing!!!]
 

 
[I can’t be complicit in this!!]
 

 
[Why am I listening to her??? Does she have no hands or feet???]
 

 
“Thank you.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the watermelon juice with both hands and smiled sweetly at her.
 

 
……
 

 
To be honest, Chang Xiaonian was straightforward and only liked men.
 

 
She liked reading romance novels and watching idol dramas.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was cold towards them, Chang Xiaonian had a negative impression of her.
 

 
However, when Tong Zhao used her tactics for dealing with men to charm and act cute with her —
 

 
The inner voice couldn’t lie: [It’s so annoying. Why does someone have to be so cute when they smile?]
 

 
[……I retract my statement about Miss Chang being the only sane person.]
 

 
[Why hate on "green tea"? It's because the "green tea" isn’t aimed at you. /doge]
 

 
Chang Xiaonian sat down with a wooden expression, struggling to accept her own behavior of switching sides.
 

 
It must have just been a momentary lapse; it doesn’t mean anything…!
 

 
※
 

 
It seemed Zhong Muxi's emotional state had been improving day by day.
 

 
The injuries on her hands had decreased but left varying shades of scars, so she only wore long-sleeved clothes to hide them, even wearing a dark-colored coat when swimming. When alone, she often stared at the wounds on her hands and regretted self-harm.
 

 
Some comments criticized her for not taking care of herself.
 

 
Others showed understanding.
 

 
As an amateur, Zhong Muxi’s solo clips had very few views.
 

 
After all, her life wasn’t very interesting; the only highlight was her interactions with Han Zhi. Han Zhi's fans might as well watch his solo clips instead.
 

 
However, the popular comments under Zhong Muxi’s solo clips received a lot of approval:
 

 
[This is what heartbreak is like. You come to terms with it yesterday, but today you can’t handle it. When you’ve accepted it, you’re as regretful and angry with yourself as you are now. But when overwhelmed by emotions, even breathing feels like a luxury. Even if you no longer love that man, you can’t face the fact that you weren’t chosen.]
 

 
NetEase Cloud has been mocked as "Net Depression Cloud," marking the onset of depression.
 

 
Yet, the large amount of breakup literature and melancholic captions on Douyin proves that there is a corresponding market demand.
 

 
The production team of "Sea King Killer" noticed this and edited some segments of Zhong Muxi with sad background music, promoting them on many marketing accounts and Douyin influencers. This helped the variety show gain more fans. Since other guests continued to show kindness towards her, it healed many viewers, and this positive sentiment also extended to the other guests.
 

 
Except for He Shun, everyone benefited.

"If I had these friends during my breakup, I wouldn’t have collapsed every night."
 

 
"Collapse later; first, make Tong Zhao a plate of sweet and sour ribs.”
 

 
The last post is from a short video:
 

 
Zhong Muxi had insomnia and subconsciously went to the kitchen to harm herself, but she ran into Tong Zhao, who was out for a walk. Tong Zhao ordered her to make a late-night snack — cooking in the middle of the night, with oil smoke everywhere, who would want to do that? However, her attitude was so casual, and Zhong Muxi was in a particularly vulnerable state, so she really put down the fruit knife and made the snack…
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t finish it alone, so she pulled Zhong Muxi to sit down and ate a big bowl of rice with sweet and sour ribs.
 

 
The carbs were overwhelming.
 

 
Zhong Muxi ended up with a full belly, dazedly being escorted back to her room.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian was awakened by the noise, she was still half-asleep. Tong Zhao's meaningful comment, “Take care of your friend,” startled her awake. She quickly pulled Zhong Muxi to wash her face, brush her teeth, and get into bed, making sure to tuck in the corners of the blanket securely before feeling at ease.
 

 
Only the omniscient viewers knew that Tong Zhao was truly a light sleeper.
 

 
Since the little dog incident, she had even moved the sofa to behind the door, sleeping directly behind the door to not miss any noise, determined to catch that dog. The audience was charmed by her relentless spirit, crowning her as the 999th generation leader of the Beggar’s Sect, mastering the art of dog-beating.
 

 
Unfortunately, the little dog never appeared.
 

 
Tong Zhao was increasingly frustrated and more determined.
 

 
In the manor with six people, the five who were grouped together made the one left out feel even worse.
 

 
Previously, He Shun was distant from others, believing he was above them and unable to relate to women and children. It was his choice. But now, others ignored him; even when their eyes met in passing, they would immediately look away. This feeling…
 

 
Was utterly terrible!
 

 
He had exposed Tong Zhao’s true nature under the public eye.
 

 
He didn’t expect that not only was she not ostracized, but her relationships with others also improved — Tong Zhao had previously relied only on him. Observing silently, his mentality began to collapse. He Shun couldn’t accept that he was a failure, a loser in this game. He had not only lost in love but also lost the respect of others.
 

 
And all of this was thanks to Tong Zhao.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t understand more and more, and he really wanted to find someone to voice his grievances.
 

 
Men wouldn’t understand; they were all Tong Zhao’s sycophants.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was too blunt to empathize with a man’s difficulties.
 

 
That left Zhong Muxi, who was weak and easy to talk to.
 

 
His thoughts were laid bare under the AI scan, and they deeply disgusted the audience.
 

 
[Picking on the weak and fearing the strong, what a real man / like/like]
 

 
[Get lost. What kind of ability is it to target the soft Zhong Muxi? If you have guts, go after Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s sarcasm is at MAX level. If he gets another round, he might never recover / doge]
 

 
Unfortunately, the audience couldn’t influence the development of the show and could only vent their frustration through comments and bullet screens. What’s worse, this episode ended with He Shun’s dark and irritable inner thoughts —
 

 
[I’m an adult; I don’t need you to prevent me from getting obsessed. I want to be obsessed!]
 

 
But it was useless. No matter how anxious he was, he had to wait for the next episode to air.
 

 
Zhong Muxi rarely had moments alone, but He Shun had too much free time. Plus, the production team deliberately arranged for them to meet — this dirty scheme was definitely kept confidential and would also increase monitoring on He Shun. If any signs of violent behavior were detected, he would be forcibly awakened before his brain could issue commands to his hands, and expelled from the holographic space.
 

 
While the variety show encouraged conflict for gimmicks, there were strict personal safety regulations to avoid leaving psychological scars on the actors and guests.
 

 
Anyway, on this morning when Zhong Muxi got up particularly early to make porridge for her friend, He Shun cornered her in the kitchen.
 

 
"Miss Zhong, I want to talk to you."
 

 
He Shun walked up to her.
 

 
Mr. He, who usually paid great attention to his personal image and dressed immaculately, now appeared tired. Underneath his typically resolute and refined face, there was a faint bluish tint, a sign of unkempt stubble. Zhong Muxi flinched slightly: "Is there something wrong? I'm cooking..."
 

 
"Listen to me first."
 

 
He Shun interrupted her, ignoring her fearful body language: "I remember that when you first arrived at the manor, you said you didn’t know how to cook. Why did you lie to me?"
 

 
He knew exactly how to bully people.
 

 
By pointing out the other party’s moral flaws, he made Zhong Muxi, who was prone to self-blame, feel disadvantaged in the conversation.
 

 
"At that time... I didn’t want to cook." Zhong Muxi clenched her fingers tightly.
 

 
"Fine, I won’t hold you accountable for lying," He Shun pretended to be magnanimous, “But isn’t it excessive how you all exclude me from everything? I was clearly deceived and hurt... I heard you’ve been through a breakup too. Why can’t you understand my feelings? By siding with Tong Zhao, you’re an accomplice."
 

 
Caught off guard by the reopened wound, Zhong Muxi looked at him in shock.
 

 
She shook her head, tears welling up in her throat.
 

 
The audience was on the verge of a brain hemorrhage, with some irate ones calling her a pushover, but more were anxiously calling for the show’s director.
 

 
From her reaction, He Shun regained his confidence.
 

 
Although his appearance was plain, this woman did have some merits.
 

 
At least she didn’t ridicule him mercilessly like the other two women.
 

 
He continued his reasoning: "Don’t deny it, and don’t say it’s Tong Zhao who doesn’t welcome me. Half a month has passed, have you ever thought about suggesting to them to invite me along? No, in the face of passive aggression, silence and watching are complicity. I really... didn’t expect you to be this kind of person. Or did you simply not realize it? Men care about details too. My breakup was due to malicious deceit, maybe you’re just too cold and numb."
 

 
Mr. He was particularly resentful.
 

 
Already feeling wronged, he was further ostracized.
 

 
"I didn’t, I didn’t know. Don’t talk to me about this. I don’t want to talk to you…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi usually had strong logical reasoning, but being abandoned was her sore spot. The moment the pain point was touched, her eyes welled up with tears, and she could only shake her head and deny it while trying to hold back the tears. She turned to escape, but he, being perceptive, stopped her in time. This time, he wasn’t angry at all and managed to control himself to avoid any physical contact—Mr. He disliked violence, considering it a barbaric and uncivilized act. The last time was purely a misunderstanding, and Tong Zhao was just too infuriating.
 

 
“Stop avoiding this—”
 

 
Before He Shun could finish his stern speech, he received a kick to his side.
 

 
The kick was swift and fierce, causing his body to tilt sideways and stumble several steps before he managed to steady himself.
 

 
It was technically an act of violence, but the production team deemed it self-defense as long as the kicker didn’t continue to assault him, it wouldn’t cross the line.
 

 
Clearly, Tong Zhao had no interest in continuing to beat him.
 

 
Her strength was limited, and she might even risk injuring herself without making a tough-skinned man feel much pain.
 

 
Tong Zhao was delicate—she could mock and insult, or incite others to fight, but personally taking action? A dog like him didn’t deserve it.
 

 
With a raised chin, Tong Zhao locked eyes with the astonished He Shun. She curled her lips into a smirk, her tone slow and firm, carrying an air of pride and condescension: “Bullying a woman you can’t defeat, so you go after weaker women? Very well, you’ve learned something.”
 

 
“You—”
 

 
“Shut up, did I give you permission to speak?!”
 

 
With the smile gone, Tong Zhao’s expression turned cold. Still dressed in her immaculate white dress, her imposing aura left He Shun speechless.
 

 
“You don’t need to ask her. I just dislike you. You annoy me. You’re not allowed at any gatherings, and if you have any objections, come to me directly. Don’t whine to others…”
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly tilted her chin towards Zhong Muxi, indicating for her to stay behind her.
 

 
She followed Tong Zhao closely like a dog that had found its owner.
 

 
“First, it shows you’re picking on the weak and fearing the strong.”
 

 
“Second, it’s useless to confront them. I’m the one with the decision-making power. Understand? They don’t matter.”
 

 
Deserving of both praise and criticism, Empress Chen never liked using her subordinates as shields.
 

 
However, she didn’t consider this as protection.
 

 
She only believed in evaluating dogs based on their owners.
 

 
He Shun’s action of bypassing her to cause trouble for Zhong Muxi completely crossed her boundaries, making her feel deeply embarrassed. She had to regain her dignity and vent her frustration with a harsh rebuke.
 

 
“And also, you were criticizing the reason for their breakup? According to your logic, the one who dumps can evaluate the one who’s dumped. Fine, listen carefully,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, with Zhong Muxi tightly holding her arm, briefly frowned but tolerated the action as if it were a gift. She channeled her slight irritation onto Mr. He, scrutinizing him from head to toe with her bright apricot eyes, and then shook her head.
 

 
While Zhong Muxi’s head shake made him feel powerful, Tong Zhao’s shake of the head made him feel defeated and humiliated, as if he were being treated like a fool:
 

 
“I rejected your confession because I look down on you, loathe you from head to toe, and find you annoying. If anyone can kneel and perform a kiss-hand gesture for me, you’re not even worthy to lick my shoes while lying on the ground.”
 

 
She was both arrogant and delighted, genuinely happy to demean her enemy.
 

 
He Shun was stunned by the insult.
 

 
The audience was also impressed by Tong Zhao’s spontaneous, flowing arrogance.
 

 
[One person desperately asks Tong Zhao to start a teaching class!!!]
 

 
[Tears, why can’t I insult people as effectively as she does?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is not just green tea; she’s a fighter jet in the red tea realm, maybe Keemun black tea... People who argue with such confidence are unbeatable. It’s a skill you can’t learn.]
 

 
There were also some off-topic comments.
 

 
Curious passersby wondered how Tong Zhao's fans must be, given how effectively she could curse. Her fans shook their heads and waved their hands, clarifying that it wasn't true. Since her debut, she had always been friendly and had never caused conflicts with others. In fact, there was almost a confrontation with Han Zhi’s fans, but as it turned out, they were all one big family, so it ended up being resolved.
 

 
Tong Zhao had no intention of staying to argue with him.
 

 
Did he deserve it?
 

 
She said everything she wanted to say and felt relieved. She didn't care how others felt; she was a woman who took arrogance to the extreme. Turning off the stove, she led Zhong Muxi out of the kitchen and upstairs. Zhong Muxi hesitated and said, “You mentioned last night that you wanted to have conpoy porridge…”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[……So it was your doing, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
[No wonder she appeared so timely; she was here to supervise, hahaha……]
 

 
“Wait, I’ll let Han Zhi make it. The kitchen is too unlucky right now, and living people shouldn’t enter.” Recently, she had picked up some jargon from playing with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Zhong Muxi whispered, “Is Brother Zhi a ghost?”
 

 
“Hmm, he’s quite ghostly.”
 

 
Han Zhi's reputation suffered.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t stand it any longer and applied to leave the event early.
 

 
After receiving approval from the production team and a vote from VIP viewers, He Shun was removed from the holographic space.
 

 
What awaited him was the sympathetic gaze of the production staff…
 

 
He Shun smiled politely, “Thank you for your hard work. I have a bit of a headache, so I’ll go rest for a while.” He decided to wait until his memory recovered to see the show’s replay and understand why others looked at him strangely.
 

 
And now, back to the reality show.
 

 
Upon arriving on the second floor, Zhong Muxi thanked Tong Zhao, her voice full of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao wondered, ‘Should I be comforting her right now?’
 

 
‘I can’t do that. I only know how to curse, mock…… and act spoiled……’
 

 
The noble lady was troubled.
 

 
Soon, her tiny bit of conscience and sympathy was depleted by her thinking, and she accepted Zhong Muxi’s thanks with composure, saying, “If you’re grateful, I want tea-marinated chicken wings and squirrel-shaped mandarin fish for dinner.”
 

 
“Okay, I’ll make them all for you.”
 

 
Preparing the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish is quite troublesome in home cooking—it requires deboning the fish, scoring it, and deep-frying it.
 

 
Viewers were excited to witness the birth of the first tool.
 

 
[Comforting people? Tong Zhao doesn’t know how. Just order some food for the cleaning staff.]
 

 
[Learned the art of ordering food as comfort.]
 

 
[I also want to be protected by a little kitty, sob sob sob……]
 

 
Tong Zhao was satisfied.
 

 
After Zhong Muxi calmed down, she couldn’t hold back her tears and quietly cried while holding onto Tong Zhao’s sleeve, making her a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
So, leading the crying and indecisive Zhong Muxi, Tong Zhao knocked on Han Zhi’s door. When he came out in slippers, she pushed her inside and briefly explained the situation: “I’m going to take a nap. I hope to have conpoy porridge by eleven.”
 

 
[It’s time for my favorite segment where Tong Zhao orders food!]
 

 
This comment was highlighted and bolded by other users.
 

 
After saying this, Tong Zhao simply left.
 

 
She believed that Han Zhi wouldn’t do something as low as taking advantage of a vulnerable girl; it was beneath his standards. Even if pressured, he likely wouldn’t act that way. When she woke up right on time at eleven, Zhong Muxi was already at the door with steaming conpoy porridge.
 

 
The viewers on the barrage had reached a level of frustration so high that they lost the will to express it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, how many caretakers' lives have you ruined!
 

 
By evening, everyone received an official notice—player He Shun had decided to withdraw from the game due to personal reasons. His previous selections would be retained, but other players could no longer choose him as their object of affection.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian spat, “Even if he were the only man left in the world, I wouldn’t choose him.”
 

 
“Well said.”
 

 
Tong Zhao happily enjoyed the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish made specially for her.
 

 
Seeing her savoring it, Chang Xiaonian also tried a bit: “It’s so sweet. How did you make it so sweet?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi quickly looked away after glancing at Tong Zhao with embarrassment.
 

 
Tong Zhao loved sweets and preferred a sweeter approach even for hot dishes.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian immediately understood: “...Xiao Xi, you just indulge her!”
 

 
The laughter and chatter around the dinner table temporarily lifted the gloom from her heart.
 

 
However, as night fell and everything grew silent, Zhong Muxi still couldn’t sleep, thinking about what Mr. He had said to her. She couldn’t control herself from recalling that failed relationship; someone she genuinely liked didn’t even give her a proper closure and left her impatiently.
 

 
She didn’t cry or make a fuss during the breakup; letting go wasn’t difficult.
 

 
What was difficult was the endless questioning of why he wasn’t willing to stay.
 

 
Each time, she felt that she was inadequate—otherwise, why couldn’t she keep the person closest to her? Reflecting on every painful detail, she wondered if noticing and doing better at that moment might have salvaged the relationship.
 

 
...
 

 
Unconsciously, Zhong Muxi found herself moving like a zombie, getting out of bed and stepping into the hallway.
 

 
She stood there, crying for a while, overwhelmed by negative emotions again.
 

 
Tonight, there are two people unable to rest peacefully.
 

 
One is Han Zhi.
 

 
The other is Wei Zekai.
 

 
When Han Zhi opened his door and didn’t see anyone in the hallway, he went downstairs. Wei Zekai, moving even more slowly, hesitated repeatedly, thinking about that tearful face, which then turned into the image of a small dog.
 

 
Another person who stays up particularly late and has light sleep is Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t worried about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
She was here to catch the dog.
 

 
Feeling burdened with the responsibility of being a righteous avenger, Wei Zekai, the dog, encountered Tong Zhao, who was holding a blanket and acting as the dog-catching team leader, once again in the hallway.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [......]
# Chapter48
When two paths cross, the brave win.
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai the corgi had many thoughts running through his mind—
 

 
For instance, he imagined a distinctive "danger" character from *Sekiro* appearing above his head.
 

 
For instance, wasn’t this his comrade?
 

 
For instance, why was Tong Zhao coming out at this time?
 

 
His view of Tong Zhao was mixed, combining two perspectives, and was quite complicated.
 

 
Tong Zhao's view of him, however, was much simpler.
 

 
She was determined to catch this dog!
 

 
After removing the bedding, she had only a thin sheet left. She threw the blanket, which fell over the small dog, enveloping him. Catching a dog by hand was too difficult and might give the dog a chance to escape. Tong Zhao never overestimated her physical abilities. Once the blanket covered the little dog, she quickly gathered it up and packed it to bring back to her room.
 

 
[Caught!]
 

 
[Lol, this combination is so offbeat.]
 

 
[The heartbreaker turned dog-catching team leader, Wei Zekai gets the first prize, add a chicken leg!]
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog really wasn’t interested in any damn chicken legs.
 

 
The blanket was making him a bit uncomfortable. Normally, a regular dog would use its claws to get out, but he was afraid of hurting Tong Zhao. So, he kept his claws sheathed and gave some symbolic angry kicks. After a couple of kicks, he found the spot where his paws were stepping felt a bit soft... Damn it!
 

 
Wei Zekai became somewhat guilty and quieted down.
 

 
[It's not like I did it on purpose, why should I feel guilty about it!]
 

 
[Forget it, I’m just afraid of hurting her if I push too hard.]
 

 
[By the way, wasn’t her right hand injured? How come she’s grabbing me so forcefully? Damn it!]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s furious barking was heard clearly by the audience with the God’s-eye view.
 

 
Usually, cursing on a variety show would lead to losing fans.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s ineffectual, furious barking actually hit the audience’s cute and funny points, making them think the little master was so adorable he should debut directly, more likable than many celebrities' true selves.
 

 
One comment that was highlighted and praised even expressed the audience’s shared sentiment:
 

 
[So, among the six people, only Wei Zekai truly believes Tong Zhao’s hand is still injured? /candle/ candle]
 

 
The general audience found him cute, but for the Wei family and those who knew both of them in real life...
 

 
Sigh, it's painful to watch.
 

 
When Wei Zekai finally escaped from the blanket trap, he first saw an enlarged female face.
 

 
Tong Zhao only had a bedside lamp on.
 

 
The warm yellow light from the side illuminated her already beautiful face, making it appear even more gentle. The director’s casual close-up shots were of cinematic quality, and screenshots of her holding the little dog were even used by netizens for promotions—so beautifully shot that the unauthorized use of this image frequently appeared on pet bloggers' and animal protection public accounts, becoming an unexpected viral sensation.
 

 
Everyone noticed Tong Zhao’s beauty.
 

 
Except the dog.
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog: [...Caught by her again!]
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog: [What’s her problem? Why is she so fixated on me? I’m supposed to be judging sea kings and saving true love!]
 

 
The little dog barked fiercely at her, warning her to let him go.
 

 
Tong Zhao remained unfazed.
 

 
She thought that Wei Zekai would definitely panic when he realized the dog was missing. If she confronted him with the dog tomorrow, maybe she could extract some information and use the opportunity to close the emotional gap. There was no other way; this little master was too difficult to crack, so she had to use unconventional methods.
 

 
As for the dog...
 

 
Tong Zhao really didn’t plan to do anything to it; she would just take good care of it for the night.
 

 
However, after it barked at her, she narrowed her eyes slightly.
 

 
Even without being familiar with “A Hundred Ways to Gaze in Romance Novels,” one could sense the danger from her slightly narrowed eyes.
 

 
The Empress Dowager loathed being provoked.
 

 
She only let the dog’s head stick out from the blanket, leaving the rest of the short dog body still wrapped up like a spring roll, ensuring the dog couldn’t run around.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can’t just take out my anger on the dog.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, the barking dog’s blame will be placed on Wei Zekai. I’ll settle it with him sooner or later.]
 

 
Having exercised some energy while catching the dog, Tong Zhao found herself unable to sleep. Feeling bored, she started playing with the dog. She had always suspected that Wei Zekai might be the judge, so perhaps this official-spy dog might have some hidden mechanisms?
 

 
With this thought in mind, Tong Zhao slipped her hand into the spring roll-like blanket, trying to search the little dog for possible cameras, recorders, or GPS devices.
 

 
At first, the dog didn’t understand what she was trying to do.
 

 
Until its sensitive, snow-white belly was rubbed by her hand.
 

 
[What... the hell!]
 

 
Tong Zhao had a basic affection for small animals. Her touch was firm yet gentle, careful not to hurt it. But this gentle petting was so ticklish that the corgi started yelping loudly. Afraid of attracting others to witness its embarrassed state, the originally robust barking turned into a soft, plaintive protest.
 

 
It sounded a lot like whining.
 

 
The audience was also stunned.
 

 
[Is this content allowed? It actually seems like it is.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai seems to have started enjoying it after barking a couple of times, hahahaha…]
 

 
[If the goddess pets me like that, I could also become a dog. Woof woof!]
 

 
The mainstream sentiment on the screen became a flood of woofs.
 

 
Everyone wanted to become a little pet of their idol.
 

 
Not finding what she had imagined on the little corgi, Tong Zhao reluctantly withdrew her hand.
 

 
And Wei Zekai had already turned into a useless dog that couldn’t even wag its tiny tail, with a blank mind: [Huff… Huff… Damn woman, why am I so ticklish? It’s driving me crazy!]
 

 
Those who are ticklish know that after being thoroughly tickled, their mental defenses are at their weakest.
 

 
It’s akin to a sage’s time.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao slowly threw out a question: “Little puppy… or should I call you Wei Zekai?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: [……]
 

 
Her tone was very certain.
 

 
Her inner thoughts were casual:
 

 
[Not finding anything, and now can’t sleep, let’s play with the dog for a bit and then sleep.]
 

 
This headless question was a byproduct of her insomnia and playing with the dog.
 

 
But Wei Zekai didn’t know she was such a bored person and was stunned.
 

 
The dog, originally looking angry, now seemed a bit cute as it stared blankly at itself. Tong Zhao, while patting its chin, continued with a smile: “Do you think you’re doing a good job acting? Actually, I saw through it long ago. Some of your small movements are common in dogs.”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao, whose interest came and went quickly, soon lost interest.
 

 
She unwrapped the blanket and planned to drive the little corgi to the bathroom, so it could make do with sleeping there for the night and avoid messing up the room: “I’m going to uncover the blanket for you now. You’d better turn back and explain things to me…”
 

 
Just as her words ended, a puff of unknown smoke with cartoon sound effects erupted on the bed.
 

 
Moments later, the smoke cleared.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “……”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “……I can explain.”
 

 
Underneath the brown-gold highlighted hair was a face of shock and embarrassment.
 

 
Suddenly appearing face-to-face, Tong Zhao’s internal thoughts raced at a speed that even advanced AI couldn't keep up with. After a rapid, almost unbelievable internal monologue, she quickly accepted this supernatural scenario and identified the most advantageous course for herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao reached out, grabbed his collar, and pulled him towards her.
 

 
Compared to Tong Zhao’s rapid internal dialogue, Wei Zekai's brain was blank. Caught off guard by her sudden pull, he stumbled forward. Fortunately, his physical reaction speed was good enough to single-handedly catch the blanket just in time…
 

 
At this moment, his and Tong Zhao’s lips were only a fingertip apart.
 

 
In the next moment, Wei Zekai scrambled to the foot of the bed, his back hitting the wall without him realizing it.
 

 
[What a waste, what a waste!]
 

 
[Wei Zekai probably thinks his reaction speed is amazing right now!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, still shaken: [Damn, I managed to avoid kissing even in that situation. I’m so awesome.]
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Laughing so hard, what’s the benefit for you? Hahaha!]
 

 
Tong Zhao clearly hadn’t expected this outcome either.
 

 
She wasn’t planning to force a kiss; she just wanted to close the distance to talk.
 

 
Even if he hadn’t managed to catch the mattress in time, she would have simply stopped his shoulder. But she never imagined he would perform such an evasive maneuver.
 

 
The two of them stared at each other in astonishment for a moment.
 

 
The romantic fantasies from love movies had vanished entirely.
 

 
The top-notch love movie heroine, the Empress, had been unexpectedly turned into a comedian.
 

 
Even Tong Zhao was momentarily at a loss for what to do.
 

 
While she was considering which tactic to switch to, Wei Zekai reacted first. His handsome face turned bright red in an instant: “W-Why did you pull me like that? You almost caused a big problem!”
 

 
The child was so frightened that he could barely articulate his words.
 

 
Wei Zekai had never been so close to a girl in his life.
 

 
Back in school, he liked to perm his hair, dye it, and get tattoos. To his classmates, he was seen as a wealthy, high-class troublemaker, and female classmates didn’t dare to talk to him. The young ladies of similar social status thought he was eccentric. Only Tong Zhao could handle his nonsensical and sharp-tongued remarks... even then, their interactions never crossed boundaries.
 

 
In the reality show, Tong Zhao was a girl he had only known for a little over half a month.
 

 
Initially, he didn’t take her seriously, and later, it was just a pure and steadfast friendship.
 

 
In the moment when he almost kissed her, Wei Zekai’s gender awareness, which had been misplaced in his brain somewhere, finally returned to its correct position. He realized that his battle comrade was a soft girl... indeed very soft... if her whole body is that soft, her lips must be soft too...
 

 
[Stop!]
 

 
[No more reminiscing!]
 

 
Wei Zekai was startled by his own thoughts.
 

 
His shyness and diminished confidence only added to his discomfort: “I didn’t choose to become a dog, and I didn’t intend to be caught...”
 

 
From an observer’s perspective, Wei Zekai was in the right.
 

 
He had turned into a dog, but he wasn’t chasing Tong Zhao; he was just innocently passing by in the hallway.
 

 
However, what kind of person is Tong Zhao? Even if Wei Zekai explained things clearly, her quick wit could come up with twisted reasoning to confuse him—she was like a keen predator, never missing any flaw.
 

 
The more he retreated, the more she pressed on.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow slightly and leaned forward. This time, Wei Zekai had nowhere left to retreat:
 

 
"Because I'm very interested in you, little doggy."
 

 
Her usually cheerful and somewhat arrogant voice was now subdued and heavy. The light from the bedside lamp cast a halo around her, outlining her graceful figure under her nightwear. In this moment of gender reversal, the scene stirred the audience's hearts with excitement, yet retained a subtle purity. The more they knew that nothing serious would happen, the more they looked forward to the development.
 

 
"Inter-interested!?"
 

 
Wei Zekai stuttered.
 

 
……
 

 
The production team was also quite intrigued at this moment.
 

 
A mischievous writer then suggested, "Why not let Wei Zekai keep his biggest appeal point?"
 

 
"What appeal point?" The director scratched his face.
 

 
"The dog ears and tail. Don’t people always want to pet him?"
 

 
Everyone agreed that this was a good idea.
 

 
The director glanced at the modeler, who confirmed that adding these features was a simple task and could be done immediately if approved. The director nodded enthusiastically, "Add them. Let the audience see this particularly honest tail."
 

 
As the audience was engrossed, an official announcement with a white background and black text popped up from above:
 

 
"Staff have decided to return some of the dog features to the Judge.”
 

 
"Hope the Judge can turn the tables with the cheats we've given him!"
 

 
Just as the comment flew by, there was a *Duang* sound, and stuttering Wei Zekai's head and rear each sprouted dog ears and a little tail.
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted this supernatural development with composure.
 

 
Her focus was solely on the prize money; as long as he didn’t turn into a cockroach, she could accept anything!
 

 
"Yes, I'm very interested in you,"
 

 
Tong Zhao pushed him against the wall. Wei Zekai, irritated, desperately pressed his ears and tail, wanting to either push them back or rip them off. However, when he tried to pull them with force, it hurt so much that his eyes turned red. His anxious and pitiful appearance stirred a hidden sadistic side in Tong Zhao. She firmly grabbed his wrist, "Stop pulling, doesn't it hurt?"
 

 
"It hurts!" Wei Zekai was furious: "This is the ability given by the officials. It was supposed to be just turning into a dog for an hour, with the option to change back at any time. Damn it, what’s with these dog ears and tail? What the hell..."
 

 
His panic even made his dialect accent pop out.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but smile and gently stroked his dog ears.
 

 
The moment she touched them, the dog ears perked up.
 

 
Wei Zekai, panicked, slapped her hand away: "Don’t touch!"
 

 
He hadn’t felt it when he was pulling them himself, but when someone else touched them—especially Tong Zhao’s cool, soft little hand—it made his nerves tingle and his whole body felt off. He had slapped a bit too hard and, realizing his mistake, his eyes showed a large amount of regret as he held her hand: "I didn’t notice earlier. Damn it, your hand was already injured… I’m sorry, my mistake."
 

 
His face was visibly remorseful.
 

 
[Poor Wei Zekai, fooled completely by the wicked woman.]
 

 
[To this day, he still believes Tong Zhao's hand is injured! Wake up!]
 

 
[He might be the type who still believes in Santa Claus as an adult.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was as stunned as the audience.
 

 
However, after hearing his self-explosion, she was even more certain of his role as the Judge and knew she needed to be more careful in her approach…
 

 
【Wei Zekai's personality is a bit off-track; you can’t use typical strategies to deal with him.】
 

 
【Playing subtlety with him either means he understands it as 'we’re really close' or, by the end of the month, he still won’t grasp my subtext. It’s useless; the subtext needs to be submerged so deep it’s at the bottom of the ocean.】
 

 
Tong Zhao's inner thoughts precisely analyzed Wei Zekai's personality.
 

 
So, she decided to go for a direct approach.
 

 
“By 'interested,' I mean I like you,”
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out her phone, turning her back to Wei Zekai as she clicked through to open the photo album.
 

 
In the album were three screenshots of the "Heartfelt" app’s interface, edited for effect.
 

 
The only difference between the three screenshots was the name selected on the app:
 

 
“You are my Heartfelt Choice.”
 

 
After a pause, amidst the audience's barrage of question marks and exclamation points and the anxious silence from Wei Zekai holding his breath, she spoke the crucial line in a firm, gentle, and earnest tone, flipping her phone to show him the screen—her carefully prepared ace!
 

 
The "Sea King Kill" battle tested emotional intelligence and, even more, intellectual prowess.
 

 
……
 

 
[Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, who can compete with her?]
 

 
[Is there a cut of this scene in Tong Zhao’s individual segment? How did Sherlock Holmes miss this clue?]
 

 
[I’m crying; my baby is being deceived by the wicked woman.]
 

 
At this moment, the audience was ecstatic over the "wicked woman."
 

 
This was precisely the kind of intellectual and courageous showdown they had hoped to see in "Sea King Kill." Tong Zhao, who remained clear-headed until the final moment, was indeed incredibly impressive… Of course, she was also very cool and fierce in "Countdown 72 Hours," with action scenes that made hearts race and legs go weak.
 

 
However, the literary scenes in "Sea King Kill" delighted the brainy audience, like taking a big bite of cake only to find it filled with fresh, surprising fruit.
 

 
This woman was a master strategist.
 

 
With "Sea King Kill" still ongoing, various variety shows and film invitations, like snowflakes, were flying into the hands of her manager, Sister Chu.
 

 
Who wouldn’t want the subconscious effects of such a show?
 

 
The one that intrigued Sister Chu the most was an invitation to a fantasy martial arts film.
 

 
"Ruthless Tribulation”
 

 
She checked the information and found that it was a long-standing major production, fully prepared and ready to start, but they were struggling with choosing the lead actress. The scriptwriter had given the heroine so many challenges that there was no suitable actress to take on the role. Moreover, the scriptwriter was a prominent figure with a powerful background who refused to make changes, leaving no solution but to delay the project.
 

 
The industry had nearly forgotten about it.
 

 
“... Let’s have Tong Zhao decide.”
 

 
Back to the scene.
 

 
Wei Zekai hesitated and asked, “You like me? How is that possible?”
 

 
Once Tong Zhao confirmed that Wei Zekai had seen the content, she pressed the lock screen button and set her phone aside.
 

 
“How is it not possible?” she asked, curious about his reasoning.
 

 
He nodded solemnly:
 

 
“Well, liking me is quite reasonable. After all, I have so many advantages. I always found it strange that no one confessed their feelings to me before. It seems the world has finally returned to normal.” Wei Zekai sighed in relief, as he had indeed been puzzled by the lack of confessions in the past! The world had been out of order.
 

 
“...”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I really want to hit him.]
 

 
However, his smugly wagging little tail was somewhat endearing.
 

 
Tong Zhao graciously forgave him and continued the scene: “So, do you have any feelings for me?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had two thoughts: [1. To seduce Wei Zekai and actually make him like her.] [2. If that doesn’t work, Plan B is to let him say he doesn’t like her, and she’ll just leave him alone, but at least she wants to pair up on the Heartfelt app. Given his personality, the chances of him agreeing are quite high.]
 

 
The ruthless and merciless woman had only one goal in mind: to complete this game.
 

 
“Huh? Feelings?”
 

 
Wei Zekai’s brain was overheating.
 

 
He was originally holding Tong Zhao’s hand to check for injuries, but she took the opportunity to interlock their fingers and put on an expression of focused anticipation: “I played so many games with you, and you don’t have any feelings for me?”
 

 
Realizing that Tong Zhao was a girl, Wei Zekai could no longer view her as he had before.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Wow, she’s kind of pretty.]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[If given another chance, would you still say it’s just a little?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, such a beautiful woman, has such a hard time being pursued. I’m starting to wonder what kind of girlfriend the real Mr. Wei would end up with.]
 

 
“I think you’re quite good,” Wei Zekai said, each word coming out slowly as if he was searching for the right expression. “Wang Er’s Diao Chan is very skilled, Orange’s Guan Yu self-destructs all the way, playing an ADC in the bottom lane against two opponents, and the support is also great at engaging…”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her temples throb.
 

 
[Forget it, I didn’t expect that even Tong Zhao would resort to moral blackmail. Sigh.]
 

 
The bullet screen exploded with comments.
 

 
“... You’re also very beautiful and a good person.”
 

 
By this point, Tong Zhao was so embarrassed she almost wished she could die.
 

 
Fortunately, it was just the two of them in the room. If a third person knew she had been rejected, she’d have to shut down on the spot.
 

 
[Hahaha, didn’t see that coming! We’re watching!]
 

 
The malicious VIP viewers even took a screenshot of the current live viewer count, adding the caption, “2516434 people watching Tong Zhao get rejected,” making the audience laugh uproariously.
 

 
[You bad woman, you have your day now!]
 

 
[So satisfying. Natural blackness is indeed a cure for scheming blackness.]
 

 
Wei Zekai finally blurted out the most crucial part: “Where do you think is a good place to buy a wedding house? During the New Year, I definitely have to go back to my own home. If you miss your home, we can each go back to our own places. My family doesn’t mind; if they do, I’ll handle it. And if we have kids, if you want them, we’ll have them. If you don’t, we won’t. But it’s better to have one. My family is quite wealthy, though we don’t have a throne, we do have a lot of money to inherit. I like both boys and girls. Actually, as long as we have a living heir, it’s not a loss. Even if it’s an alien, I’d still love it.”
 

 
…
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Huh?”
 

 
After finishing that long speech, Wei Zekai regained his rhythm. After all, he shouldn't be shy in front of his girlfriend!
 

 
So he continued to outline his future plans with Tong Zhao: “I’m currently getting an allowance from my family and have some shareholder dividends. I used to spend a lot and had no money left, but I’ll save more with a girlfriend. At most, I won’t start a business, which should save about three million each quarter to support you. After the show ends, let’s go register for marriage? If you think it’s too soon, we can get engaged first. It’s up to you; I don’t mind.”
 

 
Mr. Wei’s indifference was surprisingly detailed in his planning.
 

 
Engagement, marriage, and having children—this was his maximum understanding of romantic relationships.
 

 
As Wei Zekai spoke, he looked up, smiling with a somewhat nervous grin, his dog tail wagging as fast as a fan’s blades, and his eyes bright.
 

 
His golden-brown head was just as bright.
 

 
“According to our jungle rules, if you’re with me, you’ll get all the Buffs, but you’ll also need to share the mid-lane minions with me…”
 

 
After saying this line that would enrage any mid-laner, he suddenly lowered his head and quickly pecked her lips.
 

 
[……Got it, it’s indeed soft!]
# Chapter49
[He went for it!]
 

 
[Wow, this speed is amazing! He really is the master of tricks, like Han Zhi, a master of deception!]
 

 
[Is there a VIP brother who recorded a GIF? Please, please, please QAQ]
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned, her eyes wide.
 

 
What just happened?
 

 
Did she get kissed?
 

 
So magical…
 

 
She knew how to kiss, something deeply ingrained in her consciousness.
 

 
But what just happened could hardly be called a kiss.
 

 
It was just a brush of lips, more innocent than holding hands, and Tong Zhao found it amusing as she looked at him, realizing he hadn’t thought about what to do afterward. His ears drooped, and he just sat there, pretending to be dead. Not only was his face flushed, but his eyes were also glistening, as if he had done something remarkable and great.
 

 
Wei Zekai noticed Tong Zhao's gaze, his sensitive dog ears twitching before his face did.
 

 
“What are you laughing at?” he asked, somewhat displeased, then softened his tone: “Aren’t you angry? I kissed you out of nowhere…”
 

 
Is that something to be angry about?
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s thoughts were adorably naive, awakening a dwindling conscience in Tong Zhao that she didn’t know had been buried in a corner somewhere—her goal was just to win the game, while this little dog took her confession seriously, making her feel a pang of guilt.
 

 
“I’m not angry,”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and leaned in again.
 

 
Wei Zekai froze, staring wide-eyed.
 

 
The distance between the two was very close, so close that Wei Zekai could smell the faint scent of orange shower gel on her body, "Just wanted to teach you that what happened just now isn't called kissing, little student."
 

 
"Shit! Who are you calling a little student?"
 

 
Dangerous - elementary school student- Wei Zekai exploded, and was about to argue with his new girlfriend, but before the second sentence could be said, he was kissed back by the soft lips that came up against him. Tong Zhao kissed him against the wall, her other hand was supposed to encircle his waist, but her fingertips changed their route after touching the fluffy tail, gently grabbing the tail, and after her fingers found one of the bones, she skillfully stroked it upwards.
 

 
Wei Zekai was dumbfounded.
 

 
When the tip of her tongue pried open his thin lips, he didn't react to resist even for a moment, and was easily stirred into it.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Shit, what's going on here? I can't breathe!
 

 
As if sensing his thoughts, Tong Zhao pulls back a little, and says in a soft, mute voice, "Breathe through your nose, puppy dog."
 

 
He didn't have time to say anything, he was kissed again.
 

 
Wei Zekai is not accustomed to kissing with eyes closed, Tong Zhao also did not close her eyes, pressed under the thick eyelashes, her eyes soft and deep.
 

 
How gentle her look is, how ferocious her actions are.
 
Pushing closer and closer, kissing him until he almost fainted.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Is this, is this what love is all about? It's so exciting! It's much more exciting than a video game!
 

 
[What's wrong with playing video games, Mr. Wei?]
 

 
[What kind of drama is this? I'm high!]
 

 
The audience thought Wei Zekai was an adorable gem, even when cursing, his words had a cute tone.
 

 
But how could that be possible?
 

 
After the initial shock, Wei Zekai felt a strong sense of disbelief—why should he be held down by a delicate mid-laner? After a brief moment of stiffness, he wrapped his hand around her tiny waist and the back of her head, fiercely capturing her lips and tongue, kissing her without any restraint. Her lips were soft, and the more he kissed, the more intense it became…
 

 
When Tong Zhao was in control, the atmosphere was quite romantic.
 

 
But once it was Wei Zekai's turn to take charge, Tong Zhao suddenly broke the mood: [Ah, it feels like being enthusiastically nibbled by a large dog.]
 

 
But it's a good thing.
 

 
Men, regardless of age, whether older or younger, are considered less appealing without their sharp edges; a man who isn’t dangerous or aggressive is often seen as lacking in sex appeal. Tong Zhao felt that his currently displayed wolf-like nature was a plus, though he still had a strong “dog-like” vibe.
 
She pushed away Wei Zekai, who was in the mood for kissing.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not use much force, and Wei Zekai was pushed away by her, sitting obediently and watching her.
 

 
He was good-looking and lived a refined life, going to a high-end club every week to be styled by a familiar hairdresser. The stylist didn’t just take his money; they also gave him fashion advice and groomed his eyebrows. Whenever he appeared in public, he always looked clean and handsome. Usually proud and unruly, now under the soft light, he seemed as obedient as a well-groomed puppy.
 

 
But the taste of the passionate kiss was too wonderful, and he couldn't help but lick his lips, his little fangs revealing a hint of aggression.
 

 
He's not milky, he's fierce.
 

 
Just sits a little weird.
 

 
"Cough ......" Gui Zekai averted his eyes, his tail wagged vainly: "It's late, I'll go back to my room."
 

 
His sitting posture was a bit awkward.
 

 
"Cough..." Wei Zekai shifted his gaze, his tail flicking nervously. "It's getting late, I'm going back to my room."
 

 
Tong Zhao understood immediately.
 

 
After such an intense kiss, it was completely normal to have some indescribable reactions.
 
She didn’t feel offended; she just wanted to tease him a bit: “Aren’t you going to stay and sleep together?”
 

 
[？？？？]
 

 
[Mom won’t allow it! I don’t agree!]
 

 
[I agree! Let’s skip straight to the wedding night!]
 

 
[Got it, the way to conquer a scheming heartthrob is to be a naive sweetheart.]
 

 
This invitation is so tempting ah, Wei Zekai looks at her eyes brightly full of danger, as long as he can not hold, he will gnawes not only the mouth, but the whole person will be peeled off the bones and devoured clean ......
 

 
Yet no.
 

 
"I won't!"
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, clearly pleased: “Elementary schooler, huh?”
 

 
“You're the elementary schooler! I'm going back to my room!”
 

 
He closed his eyes, getting out of bed in a huff, and fled as if escaping, all while Tong Zhao's light laughter echoed behind him.
 

 
At that moment, an announcement popped up on the screen—
 

 
“After watching the cat and dog battle, let’s rewind the timeline back to fifteen minutes ago.”
 

 
Then came a rewind effect and a recap.
 

 
The four of them got up because they heard Zhong Muxi sobbing in the hallway. Wei Zekai had done a lot of mental preparation before turning into a dog, wasting some time and falling a step behind Han Zhi, which led to him being intercepted by Tong Zhao. Wei Zekai wasted some time because he did a lot of psychological construction before he turned into a dog, and he was slower than Han Zhi, so he was intercepted by Tong Zhao.
 

 
In the end, only Han Zhi found Zhong Muxi huddled in the corner of the kitchen.
 

 
She was already thin, and now curled up into a ball, making her even less noticeable.
 

 
Whether psychologically or physically, when a person is enduring immense pain, they tend to instinctively shrink into themselves, as if doing so could reduce the area of impact, ideally getting smaller and smaller until they disappear entirely.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly noticed the knife in her hand.
 

 
Her hand, gripping the knife, trembled uncontrollably. She was making a strong effort to withstand wave after wave of negative emotions, holding back the urge to harm herself, not wanting her friends to worry or to let down their goodwill.
 

 
[What, is she having another episode?]
 

 
[Don’t say it so harshly…]
 

 
[Han Zhi, maybe you shouldn’t go over there. What if you get hurt?]
 

 
A debate erupted in the comments.
 

 
Some felt that Han Zhi shouldn’t go over and should prioritize his own safety.
 

 
Others believed that only Han Zhi could save her.
 

 
No matter how intense the arguments got, Han Zhi walked over and sat down beside her, softly calling, “Muxi.”
 

 
He called her several times before Zhong Muxi finally looked up at him, her eyes behind the lenses blurred with tears.
 

 
“Come here, let me hug you.”
 

 
Han Zhi ignored the knife in her hand and directly pulled her into his arms.
 

 
His large hand firmly grasped her shoulder, but he didn't cross any boundaries: “Unfortunately, my body temperature is a bit low. If I had a warm, furnace-like body, it would feel more comfortable to hug.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi couldn't find her voice and shook her head in his embrace.
 

 
[No… it’s already good.]
 

 
[It’s my fault. Everyone has helped me, and I can’t keep being so helpless.]
 

 
Her voice seemed choked by tears, only the audience could hear her silent thoughts.
 

 
“Feeling sad and upset is a normal reaction. Having friends around definitely helps, but it won’t make everything better immediately; no one is that powerful. Sometimes, you might even force yourself to accept their help, only to break down and cry when you’re alone at night… In those moments, you feel even worse, thinking you’re hopeless, not just disappointing your partner but also letting down your friends, and feeling like you can’t do anything right.”
 

 
As he spoke, Han Zhi’s chest vibrated softly. “Isn’t it strange? Friends who want to help you might end up being the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.”
 

 
His voice was calm, tinged with a hint of compassion.
 

 
When he spoke, it seemed like everything could be forgiven.
 

 
There are often short videos on Douyin harshly criticizing those who’ve experienced heartbreak. Even if they’re well-intentioned, Han Zhi disagreed with them.
 

 
In his eyes, pain, sorrow, and an inability to let go are all valid.
 

 
You have to forgive yourself for still loving that jerk and accept the restless nights you endure.
 

 
“No…” Zhong Muxi explained softly, “It’s my own problem; everyone has been really good to me.”
 

 
Han Zhi: "I just noticed something."
 

 
Han Zhi: "After Muxi realized I was here, she immediately turned the blade toward herself... Seriously, a girl who is sad to the extreme only ends up hurting herself. I must make her happy again."
 

 
The detail Han Zhi noticed went unnoticed by the audience at first.
 

 
Once he pointed it out, the comments section exploded with reactions.
 

 
[Wow, Brother Zhi is so gentle, sob sob sob.]
 

 
[Let him be the sea king; it feels like he’s here to save all the suffering souls, being kind to just one girl is such a waste of talent! /dog head]
 

 
[I have a similar experience, really. If I had been a bit tougher, that jerk would already be reincarnated… I just can’t show aggression toward others. When men go crazy and take revenge on society, I go crazy and take revenge on myself.]
 

 
Many comments shared personal stories about their low points in life.
 

 
Why do sad songs sell so well?
 

 
Because there’s nothing new under the sun; the same suffering keeps happening.
 

 
It’s just that they weren’t as fortunate to meet someone like Han Zhi to guide them.
 

 
"The kitchen floor is hard; let’s find another place to talk," Han Zhi said.
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded.
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded.
 

 
Han Zhi led her to his room, directly into the bedroom.
 

 
The previously warm comments immediately changed tone.
 

 
However, what they expected didn’t happen. After Zhong Muxi sat on the edge of the bed, Han Zhi poured her a cup of hot chocolate from a thermos on his bedside desk and encouraged her to drink it slowly: “I like to have something sweet before brushing my teeth and going to bed,” he said.
 

 
Warmth spread from her fingertips, and Zhong Muxi took small sips, her cold hands and feet gradually warming up.
 

 
“Are you very concerned about what He Shun said?”
 

 
Han Zhi casually brought it up: “I heard a summary of the conversation from Tong Zhao.”
 

 
At his words, Zhong Muxi's shoulders tensed. Even though she was reluctant to admit it, she slowly nodded: “Actually… I don’t like that guy anymore, but the whole situation is so complicated. It feels like there are endless challenges to overcome. Is it that if I were just a little better, he wouldn’t leave me? Am I really that inadequate? … Maybe I am. I really hate my personality.”
 

 
She self-deprecatingly lifted the corners of her mouth: “I really envy Tong Zhao.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Hmm?”
 

 
[Tong Zhao, huh?]
 

 
[Not surprising, she's the type that easily makes other women both envious and jealous.]
 

 
“Look, a guy like He Shun would cook for her and run errands because she's good enough and worthy. I can imagine… if she were to break up, no matter how long she dated her boyfriend, it would never be as embarrassing as my situation.”
 

 
Han Zhi: [The implication that she's good enough means Muxi feels she’s not good enough or worthy.]
 

 
“I’ve never seen her when she’s heartbroken, so I can’t really judge,”
 

 
Han Zhi sat beside her, his long legs casually stretched out: “Let’s look at it from another angle. No one is inherently bad, and everyone deserves to be valued. So where does the problem lie, do you know?”
 

 
“...Me?” Zhong Muxi replied, puzzled.
 

 
Han Zhi ruffled her hair, wanting to shake some sense into this self-blaming girl: “The problem is that no one dares to voice their own needs.”
 

 
“Human nature is flawed like that; if you’re accommodating and passive, the other person will take advantage. When conflicts arise, if you first reflect on yourself, they will seize the opportunity. A woman who always says yes will eventually encounter… or foster a man who always says no.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi lowered her head: “It’s all because I’m too soft.”
 

 
“Softness can translate to being too considerate, too gentle, too thoughtful of others.”
 

 
Han Zhi’s gentle praise made her feel a bit shy and warm.
 

 
Was she really as good as he said?
 

 
She only said, “Tong Zhao is really impressive. Sometimes I wish I could be as amazing as her.”
 

 
Han Zhi inwardly gasped.
 

 
Having a difficult woman like Tong Zhao was enough; being too much like her might not be a good thing.
 

 
“Don’t set so many goals. Trying to become someone else is very hard. Even if you really manage to imitate them, there’s nothing to be particularly proud of,” Han Zhi said as he took the fruit knife from her hand and placed it on the nightstand, then intertwined his fingers with hers. “If you’re a meat bun, Tong Zhao might be a particularly beautiful fruit hard candy. That’s okay; a round, plump meat bun can be very endearing. I love eating those.”
 

 
He pinched her cheek, which was indeed soft like a bun.
 

 
Han Zhi’s metaphor made her laugh.
 

 
Fruit hard candy sounded sweet and appealing.
 

 
But the way he described the meat bun—round and plump—made it seem cute as well.
 

 
After looking at it from a different angle, she felt much of the gloom in her chest dissipate.
 

 
Before this, Zhong Muxi had desperately denied herself, wanting to escape from the weak and tearful ‘Zhong Muxi.’ Becoming someone else felt too difficult; it would be better to just disappear.
 
But now ......
 

 
She admitted, “I seem to get upset more easily than others.”
 

 
Han Zhi replied, “Yeah, feeling sad is normal.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi felt a bit shy, “I want to try accepting this tearful side of myself. Actually, I've managed to avoid self-harm these days. The scars on my hands are all old ones now…”
 

 
The production team had female staff members who felt sorry for her and secretly adjusted the data to help her wounds heal faster.
 

 
The scar near her arm had completely healed, leaving only an ugly dark mark.
 

 
She raised her hand, the light highlighting the particularly deep scar:
 

 
“Isn’t it ugly? But no matter how ugly it is, it’s still my hand. I want to learn to accept myself, like you said.”
 

 
At this moment, aside from a few radical comments, the mainstream voices in the comments were mostly encouraging her.
 

 
[Not ugly at all! Let’s start over!]
 

 
[Plastic surgery techniques are advanced now; what’s this sister’s Weibo? I want to recommend her a hospital.]
 

 
[Some people just have a lower tolerance. She hasn’t harmed anyone, right? She’s trying her best. Although I’ve never self-harmed and don’t encourage it, I’ve experienced moments when I wanted to die. The last time was when I discovered my boyfriend was complaining to his friends that I wasn’t as pretty as others, while I was the one willing to split the bill on dates. That’s why I fell asleep first—because I understood how hard it was for him.]
 

 
“Let me see.”
 

 
Han Zhi took her other hand. She felt a bit embarrassed and tried to pull it back, but he held it more firmly.
 

 
His fingertips gently traced her skin for a moment: “It’s really clear.”
 

 
“Yeah, it’s been a long time.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi lowered her head.
 

 
“Wait for me a moment.”
 

 
Han Zhi stood up, walked to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved a sketch of Zhong Muxi, handing it to her. Then he rummaged through his suitcase: “I remember introducing myself on the first day. I write novels, but drawing is also one of my many interests.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi took the sketch and froze.
 

 
This page captured her expression perfectly, with just the right amount of enhancement. It showed the kind of beauty she only saw when she stood in front of the mirror after a shower without her glasses. The gentle, timid look between her brows left her staring for quite a while, until Han Zhi pulled a chair to sit in front of her and took her arm, bringing her back to reality.
 

 
Han Zhi held a freshly unwrapped small palette.
 

 
There weren’t many colors, only twelve.
 

 
“There’s a box here that can be used on skin. Do you mind if I borrow your hand for a bit?” Han Zhi glanced at her, and Zhong Muxi quickly shook her head to show she didn’t mind.
 

 
Zhong Muxi thought:
 

 
[Although I don’t know what Han Zhi is planning to do…]
 

 
[He’s already helped me so much; whatever he wants to do with my hand, I’ll agree to it.]
 
Han Zhi dipped the brush in water and began to trace her arm.
 

 
He didn’t choose the fair skin; he worked on the scars.
 

 
Under his brush, the deep, flesh-colored scars were transformed into a shade of pale green.
 

 
Then, he painted small, round white lanterns one after another.
 

 
Finally, a string of lilies of the valley sprang to life on Zhong Muxi’s arm.
 

 
“The language of lilies of the valley is ‘happiness returns,’” Han Zhi casually placed the painting tools on the nearby desk, lifted her arm, and gently blew on it a few times to let the paint dry to a semi-dry state. “In the past, other men may have brought you happiness and then left… It’s okay; this time, the happiness you find is your own, not because of others, and certainly not because of me.”
 

 
The ugly scars turned into a string of charming lilies of the valley under his brush.
 

 
Zhong Muxi thought of what he said about the meat bun—
 

 
“These lilies of the valley kind of look like meat buns.”
 

 
After saying this, she couldn’t help but laugh at herself.
 

 
Han Zhi thought: [It’s good that you can smile.]
 

 
After chatting with her for a while, the paint on her arm dried. Noticing her face showed a bit of fatigue, Han Zhi suggested she wash up in his bathroom and sleep directly in his room while he would take the couch in the living room. Zhong Muxi felt a bit shy, clutching the bed sheet, her delicate face showing hesitation after taking off her clunky glasses: “Isn’t that a bit much? You shouldn’t have to sleep on the couch…”
 

 
“I’m not comfortable with you going back to your room alone,”
 

 
Han Zhi leaned down, allowing her, with her poor eyesight, to see his face clearly: “You’re very cute. Be good and don’t say such tempting things to me.”
 

 
With that, he turned off the room light with a snap and left, closing the door behind him.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was left with a flushed face after being teased.
 

 
At this moment, she had completely forgotten the name of the scumbag, her mind filled only with those gentle eyes.
 

 
The next morning, when Han Zhi brought up his sea king mission, she agreed without hesitation: “Actually, you don’t even need to mention it; I would fill in your name anyway.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled, “I’m so happy.”
 

 
In contrast to their harmony, another sea king was in chaos.
 

 
Tong Zhao was woken up by Wei Zekai.
 

 
This guy had gotten up early, excited to make breakfast for his girlfriend using online tutorials and kitchen ingredients. Knowing the principle of treating others as one would want to be treated, he made all his favorite foods—
 

 
With a combination of low blood sugar and morning grumpiness, Tong Zhao shuffled in her slippers, staring at the steaming food on the table.
 

 
Fried chicken, French fries, pudding, and a bottle of soda.
 

 
No one dislikes junk food!
 

 
This was something Wei Zekai firmly believed.
 

 
Even though they had a dedicated chef at home providing nutritious meals, he would sometimes get the urge to eat spicy hotpot early in the morning. With his robust stomach, he had never suffered from his peculiar dietary preferences.
 

 
Now, he had piled all his favorite foods in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
“I made it myself,” Wei Zekai said modestly.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond, just looking at him with her beautiful eyes, heavy with emotion.
 

 
[Your Highness, calm down! Murder is against the law!]
 

 
[Who eats this for breakfast, hahaha…]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Crazy…]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, it’s not nice to refuse something made by hand.]
 

 
When she first got up, her mind was a bit foggy. She looked fierce, but really she was just a paper tiger, more easygoing than usual.
 

 
She picked up a piece of fried chicken and took a bite.
 

 
The fried chicken was raw inside.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t swallow, glancing at the cross-section of the chicken on her chopsticks, which was completely undercooked.
 

 
She turned her head and spat the small piece she had bitten into the trash can.
 

 
Tong Zhao grabbed a handful of fries sprinkled with salt.
 

 
The fries were also undercooked.
 

 
And what she thought was salt turned out to be sugar.
 

 
The half-cooked taste, mixed with oil and sugar's sweetness, created a very peculiar flavor.
 

 
Since the fries were store-bought frozen ones, they achieved an impressive contrast of hot on the outside and frozen on the inside.
 

 
In her past life, she had committed crimes; in this life, she was eating food made by Wei Zekai.
 

 
At first, Wei Zekai was too embarrassed to look at her and didn’t notice she had spat out the chicken. Finally, he gathered his courage and turned to her: “Tasty, right? Don’t worry, I’m not one of those dads who just hands off the cooking. If I had kids, I would definitely make them cute bento boxes myself.”
 
......
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly felt the desire to be child-free for the first time.
 

 
This half-cooked gift made her a bit more awake: “You sit down and try it yourself.”
 

 
“I made it for you, so eat more if you like it.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Hehe, all the good stuff is for her; I’m such a good man!]
 

 
Under Tong Zhao's insistence, Wei Zekai finally tasted his own cooking, and his proud demeanor quickly turned sheepish. Tong Zhao rubbed her forehead, her mind now fully alert: “Forget it, I’ll go…” She intended to say she’d cook, but the words changed: “I’ll go find Sister Muxi.”
 

 
As long as the world doesn’t explode, Tong Zhao won’t work.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt they were already in a relationship, so it was natural to include her in his list of crushes.
 

 
When he boasted about this to Tong Zhao, she paused for a moment: “You have to learn from your mistakes, little puppy.”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t understand the saying and asked, “I want to hold hands.”
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the end, the two sea kings exchanged phones and filled in each other's names, fulfilling the conditions for the game—
 

 
Neither of them trusted the other, so exchanging phones felt the safest.
 

 
With the two sea kings clearing the level, the game ended early.
 

 
When the sun rose the next day, the remaining civilian players woke up to notifications that the event had concluded. The rooms of the two were already cleaned out and empty. Meanwhile, that previous night, under Han Zhi’s humanitarian guidance, Wei Zekai learned how to make a proper breakfast, but it remained untouched and cold, waiting for its owner.
 

 
Everyone woke up in the holographic filming chamber.
 

 
The female staff member responsible for waking Wei Zekai had red eyes and couldn’t help but say to him, “You’ve had it really tough.”
 

 
“Huh? What do you mean?”
 

 
With no memory of what had happened, Wei Zekai still didn’t know he had been completely betrayed by his good friend.
# Chapter50
Wei Zekai felt a bit uneasy as he was met with sympathetic looks.
 

 
After coming out of the holographic chamber, he was physiologically fatigued, and the staff wouldn’t engage with the actors unless necessary. They only reminded him, “There’s a small celebration dinner at six o’clock the day after tomorrow. The director has reserved a hot pot restaurant nearby, so if you’re free, come join us for a nice meal.”
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded, “I’ll see how it goes.”
 

 
He didn’t feel particularly tired; he was just a bit dazed, like after an intense gaming session where he couldn’t even remember which hero he had chosen, only vaguely aware that he had played some frustrating games.
 

 
After returning to his room, he still didn’t want to sleep, so he pulled out his phone to message Tong Zhao.
 

 
Upon opening his phone, he was shocked to see dozens of missed calls and over a hundred unread WeChat messages, with chaotic group chats all @-ing him, most likely related to the airing of "Sea King Killer." It was overwhelming, and he didn’t want to sift through it all, so he just checked the pinned messages.
 

 
His pinned messages were simple.
 

 
Parents, family group, Zeshan Investment Company management group, and Tong Zhao.
 

 
Dad: “You look just like your mom.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was puzzled and wanted to reply, “Dad, are you okay?”
 

 
But thinking about how he needed funding during his startup period, he decided against saying anything offensive. Instead, he replied, “I inherited my mom’s beauty, but my IQ and business sense are all thanks to your good genes, Dad!”
 

 
It seemed he had a talent for flattery.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt he had sacrificed a lot for the company.
 

 
However, after seeing that reply, his father’s blood pressure skyrocketed—that was a story for another time.
 

 
Mom: “Xiao Kai, bring Tong Zhao over for dinner when you have time.”
 

 
It was a small matter.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai found it a bit strange that his mother suddenly mentioned Tong Zhao, he readily agreed.
 

 
Perhaps it was because his friend's movie was a big hit, and Tong Zhao was now a rising star; maybe his mom was curious to see her in person so she could brag to her mahjong buddies. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that was the case. A slight smile appeared on his lips, filled with the joy of “My brother is popular, and I look good because of it.”
 

 
Just as Wei Zekai was feeling pleased, he opened the company group chat to check if his team had caused any trouble while he was busy filming a variety show.
 

 
He was somewhat worried before clicking in.
 

 
If there weren’t any major issues, would they really be @-ing him so vigorously?
 

 
But when he opened it, he saw:
 

 
Second Generation A: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
Second Generation B: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
Second Generation C: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
...
 

 
They were lined up in formation. Wei Zekai snorted coldly; there were always troublemakers trying to get to him.
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I have billions to inherit, what about you?”
 

 
Unfortunate?
 

 
Impossible; “unfortunate” wasn’t in Wei Zekai’s dictionary.
 

 
Seeing Wei Zekai flaunt his wealth broke the defenses of the second-generation crowd—
 

 
Their families were wealthy too, but they had siblings to split the inheritance, and the degree of wealth could vary drastically among rich second-generation individuals. The Wei family’s wealth was something the other second-generation members looked up to. Wei Zekai could become their leader not only because of his arrogant personality but also largely due to having a good father.
 

 
Second Generation C: "You have billions, but you can’t get our Sister Zhao!"
 

 
Everyone chimed in with agreement.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt even more annoyed by this group of brats: "Why would I want Tong Zhao? She’s a person, not an object. Show some respect for your esteemed strategist!"
 

 
The title "esteemed strategist" was so cringeworthy that the entire management team burst into laughter, urging him to quickly watch the replay of "Sea King Kill." Someone even suggested they all go watch together: "Why not just go to the Boss's house? He has an IMAX and holographic setup."
 

 
Wei Zekai thought about it; his mom had said she wanted to meet Tong Zhao.
 

 
After all, they were brothers. Meeting one was the same as meeting a bunch: "Sure, let’s go together."
 

 
When Wei Zekai mentioned it to Tong Zhao, she agreed, so she packed her bags and hopped into his flashy sports car, heading straight for the Wei family home. Before they left, Wei Zekai had mentioned bringing a friend home. To him, it was a minor matter—there was plenty of food at home, and the chef could handle a gathering of ten or so people. If they needed more help, borrowing from a neighbor was also an option.
 

 
“Xiao Kai said he’s bringing Tong Zhao back to see his screen debut,”
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Wei’s mother frowned, saying, “They’re coming now? This is too sudden; I’m not prepared at all. Would it be too tacky to give a big red envelope? How thick does it need to be to seem sincere?”
 

 
The girl’s purse was small; a little makeup and her phone would fill it up, and a thick red envelope wouldn’t fit.
 

 
Wei’s grandmother suggested, “How about getting a gold bracelet from the safe?”
 

 
“Gold jewelry seems a bit old-fashioned these days.”
 

 
“Gold is great; I love gold,” Wei’s grandmother muttered.
 

 
“Who cares!” Wei’s father interjected, his teeth grinding: “Didn’t you hear what they said on the show? He plans to spend three million a month on his girlfriend. Instead of giving her a red envelope, he should just halve his allowance so he doesn’t get scammed by women.”
 

 
Wei's mother smiled, "Well, didn’t Tong Zhao come to our house before? You weren’t here, so you didn’t see her in person. She’s a good kid. You can’t judge her based on variety shows; besides, if she’s after his money, that’s not a bad thing. If she’s after his money, it can last longer."
 

 
Not to mention three million; even if it doubled, it’s just a number.
 

 
Moreover, she had seen Tong Zhao in "Countdown 72 Hours," and thought the girl was quite independent and strong. It was just the script of "Sea King Kill" that made her seem like a gold digger—after all, it was clear from the beginning that the show was about outsmarting each other. Why did her little Kai forget his own responsibilities as soon as he fell in love and empty his already limited IQ?
 

 
Only those who remember their competition can be the winners who laugh last.
 

 
"You just have too many ridiculous theories."
 

 
Wei's father paused and turned around, "Are you after my money too?"
 

 
"Of course not; I’m after your good character and handsome looks."
 

 
She said with a smile.
 

 
Satisfied with the answer, Wei’s father snorted and pretended to continue reading the newspaper.
 

 
Wei’s grandmother watched for a while and felt more and more that the men of the Wei family were doomed to be scammed by women.
 

 
In any case, the whole Wei family looked forward to Tong Zhao's arrival.
 

 
……
 

 
Then, six spirited young men with wild personalities and one suspicious figure wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a mask showed up.
 

 
The suspicious figure, Tong Zhao, took off her entire disguise and stuffed it into her bag before greeting the elders politely.
 

 
Dressed in a black silk shirt and a cream-colored irregular skirt, her outfit was simple, elegant, and generous. The high heels accentuated her beautifully proportioned legs…
 

 
She was particularly polite to the elders, but when speaking to her peers, even with a smile, there was an aura that suggested she was not to be trifled with.
 

 
Seeing this, Wei’s father felt a pang of jealousy.
 

 
Vaguely recalling that the Tong family was also in business, how come their child is so poised?
 

 
Looking back at his own family, Wei's father felt increasingly annoyed.
 

 
"It’s rare to have friends over, aren’t you going to introduce them?"
 

 
Wei's mother smiled at the spirited young men.
 

 
The Wei residence was particularly large. They had originally planned to sneak in, but Tong Zhao insisted that it was rude not to announce their arrival, so they entered through the front door. Otherwise, there were plenty of ways to slip in quietly. Now, facing figures they had to treat with caution, even in front of their own parents, they felt a bit nervous.
 

 
Only Wei, the young master, was casually revealing his own background: "I’ve been starting a business recently. I used to think small, but now I've decided to make money together. They’re all shareholders in Zeshan Investment." He patted Tong Zhao’s shoulder, "This is our strategist!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao really didn’t want to be called a strategist in front of the elders.
 

 
The elders of the Wei family exchanged glances, their expressions subtly changing.
 

 
It was one thing to lose money themselves; now they were bringing someone else's child along to lose money?
 

 
What a big ambition.
 

 
Wei's father quietly observed their faces and found them all unfamiliar. He hoped they weren't the children of old friends. It was normal for him not to recognize them; those willing to hang out with Wei Zekai, fully aware of his reputation as the "reverse alchemist," "charitable gambling king of the investment world," and "most ambitious spendthrift," were likely from wealthy families themselves.
 

 
The ones he could introduce were all siblings of these spirited young men.
 

 
Wei's mother was curious: "Strategist?"
 

 
"The investment ideas were hers; I just helped her out." Wei Zekai never stole his friends’ thunder.
 

 
The Wei family elders breathed a sigh of relief—so it seemed they wouldn't suffer major losses!
 

 
Tong Zhao knew these investments would inevitably succeed.
 

 
After leaving the cabin, she didn’t first check the flattering messages about herself; instead, she looked at the projects of Zeshan Investment to ensure everything was on track as she had envisioned. The points she had reminded them about had been well addressed, confirming that making money was only a matter of time.
 

 
Even if Wei Zekai didn’t take credit, she wanted to help him make a good impression in front of the elders: "Actually, Zekai has contributed a lot. I just suggested some directions; many of the remaining details were thought up and perfected by him.”
 

 
The Wei family elders had just relaxed when their tension returned.
 

 
After understanding their intentions, Wei's mother suggested, "How about we prepare a hot pot? It’ll be fun to enjoy together, and we don’t mind joining in on the young people's activities, right?"
 

 
The young second-generation members exchanged glances.
 

 
They were aware of the content of "Sea King Kill."
 

 
It wasn’t appropriate to watch it in front of the elders!
 

 
Someone made faces at Wei Zekai, but he was completely oblivious to his friends' concerns and continued to reassure them, "No problem. Don’t worry, my family is very open-minded. You can vent your thoughts freely; there’s no need to feel awkward! Let’s watch together—it's a rare family activity!"
 

 
…
 

 
No, it’s not that everyone is afraid of feeling awkward themselves.
 

 
We’re worried about YOU feeling awkward!
 

 
And it’s already becoming awkward to have to loan you out!
 

 
Since Wei Zekai had said this, everyone felt they couldn't object any longer.
 

 
"It’s quite long; will we be able to finish it?" asked one second-generation member.
 

 
"Well, we’ll be eating while watching, so we can just focus on the interactions between Tong Zhao and Boss," a rather straightforward second-generation girl cheerfully said, only to receive a collective glare from the others.
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, thought this was a great idea, so it was settled.
 

 
Not long after the instructions were given, the servants and chef cleared a large area in the banquet hall and set up a long table for the hot pot. A massive projection screen descended, and when the main lights were turned off, four pots bubbled and boiled. There was a nourishing chicken soup pot for the elders, a spicy Chongqing hot pot favored by the younger crowd, and a trendy tomato pot. The congee-based hot pot in front of Wei’s father was particularly special, with a creamy white broth that came with a seafood gout package.
 

 
The atmosphere was warm and harmonious.
 

 
Wei Zekai wasn't exaggerating; the atmosphere at his home was indeed great, with no chaotic internal conflicts.
 

 
When asked if he remembered what happened in the show, he scratched his head and said, "I can't recall clearly; the memory is a bit buried. Tong Zhao, do you remember anything?"
 

 
"It's only been a short time; I’ll probably remember everything when I wake up tomorrow."
 

 
They had gone directly to Wei's house after leaving the holographic pod.
 

 
"By the way, uncle and aunt," one of the second-generation members asked, "did you watch the last episode live?"
 

 
Since they wanted to watch the final episode with the two main characters, they missed the live broadcast and only saw the second-to-last episode, where Wei Zekai was successfully deceived by a bad woman and made a declaration of three million in love offerings... Although they didn’t know how it ended, it was undoubtedly a disaster.
 

 
Wei's mother shook her head, "I still prefer to wait for the edited version."
 

 
At first, everyone felt embarrassed for Wei Zekai and fidgeted in their seats.
 

 
But as the pot began to boil, Wei Zekai started talking excitedly: "Do you know? The day after I went in, the director told me he could tell right away that I was a talent for reality shows; he praised me for being interesting—oh, not to mention, this director really has good judgment. I knew from the moment he invited Tong Zhao that he was sharp. Can you guess how he described me?"
 

 
Tong Zhao put some vegetables into the pot first: "Cute and brainless?"
 

 
Second-generation member C: "A gem among men, a cute dog among dogs?"
 

 
Second-generation member F: "That doesn’t even rhyme!"
 

 
…
 

 
"That’s all nonsense,”
 

 
Wei Zekai shot them a defiant look: "If it weren’t for me, Wei Zekai, reality shows would be as dark as eternal night!"
 

 
...
 

 
The group exchanged glances—regardless of the director's skills, his talent for flattery was top-notch.
 

 
Wei Zekai looked so proud that it seemed his tail was about to fly up to the sky, making everyone feel a mix of irritation and amusement, shifting from "worrying about his embarrassment" to "let's just start the broadcast and let him embarrass himself, please make it raw and unfiltered!"
 

 
Tong Zhao used the public chopsticks to pick beef from each pot, enjoying her meal.
 

 
She was quite indifferent.
 

 
As an actress, whether in traditional films or reality shows, one had to let go of shame and reserve. Reality shows didn’t pursue artistic value; as long as they entertained, that was a pass. Besides, she felt confident...
 

 
Especially as Concubine Chen, she felt invincible.
 

 
[Ha,] Concubine Chen thought: [With me around, how could I possibly embarrass myself? No way.]
 

 
Duan Ge laughed and poked fun: [Oh really? You nearly ended up in a relationship with Han Zhi once.]
 

 
Concubine Chen hissed.
 

 
They were the same person.
 

 
Despite their vastly different personalities, it felt like being six and twenty at the same time. If genuine sparks were to fly, it might be a bit cringeworthy. The concubine Chen waved her fan dismissively: [This is just for fun; no one would take it seriously. Besides, it’s perfectly normal for Han Zhi to have feelings for me.]
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t deny it.
 

 
Not because he truly loved Concubine Chen, but because it would be too hurtful to refute a woman's words at that moment.
 

 
Enduring a little misunderstanding was nothing.
 

 
[No man can refuse me.]
 

 
Concubine Chen proudly set a bold statement.
 

 
The onlookers, eager for entertainment, suggested starting the broadcast with the memory-lost interaction cut from the third-to-last episode.
 

 
The dimly lit banquet hall turned dark as the huge projection screen displayed a shadowy corridor.
 

 
In the corridor, the sound of suppressed sobbing echoed softly.
 

 
"Is it haunted or something?"
 

 
Unaware of the seriousness of the situation, Wei Zekai continued to chatter, taking on the role of the main commentator.
 

 
The camera zoomed in on Zhong Muxi, who was emotionally collapsing.
 

 
The cut version of the reality show was well done, thanks to AI handling the heavy lifting, requiring only time for high-speed calculations, with all the algorithms already well-developed. Although it was a dual interaction cut of Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai, the backstory was explained in detail.
 

 
"Oh, so it’s her..."
 

 
Wei Zekai paused, seeing Han Zhi follow suit, feeling more at ease: "Mom, I’m telling you, my brother’s male subconscious is particularly reliable; if he were just a bit more focused, he’d be perfect," he said, glancing at Tong Zhao with a hint of regret. "If only you were a guy!"
 

 
A partner sipping chicken soup almost choked at his shocking words.
 

 
"Go ahead and blame Tong Zhenming."
 

 
Watching the reliable Tong Zhao wipe her mouth, she elegantly echoed his absurd logic: "It’s a chromosome issue; don’t blame me."
 

 
"Fair point, so it’s all his fault."
 

 
Wei Zekai knew all about the mess in his friend's family; genuinely noting another black mark against Tong’s father was just a matter of time before it would be settled with interest! Just then, another door in the scene slowly creaked open, and the camera shifted down to give a close-up of the anxious little corgi.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wei Zekai found it hard to accept seeing his dog's face on the big screen.
 

 
Damn it, didn’t he resolve to stop becoming a dog?
 

 
Where are your principles in this reality show, Wei Zekai!?
 

 
He calmly tried to smooth things over: "Eh, it’s my fault for being too eager to help; I should have just let Han Zhi handle it."
 

 
Just then, with the sound of another door opening, the camera shifted again.
 

 
Wei Zekai saw his good friend, Tong Zhao, holding a blanket.
 

 
No, please don’t let it be what he’s thinking! What’s going on here?!
 

 
Outside of the scene, Tong Zhao remained calm. After getting her uncle's approval, she scooped a bowl of seafood porridge from his pot. While the people in reality were eating and drinking, her persona in her mind was thoroughly enjoying the moment. The concubine remembered that she had also raised some small pets in the palace before—though "raising" meant that the servants took care of everything; she was only responsible for happily petting the dogs and cats.
 

 
As the little dog in the scene was firmly caught in the blanket, Wei Zekai turned to Tong Zhao with a look of accusation: "How can you treat me like this!"
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "I didn’t know it was you."
 

 
"Oh, so if you knew it was me, you wouldn’t have caught me?"
 

 
Tong Zhao considered, "…I would probably be even more determined."
 

 
"Our friendship dog is dead!"
 

 
"Not dead," Tong Zhao said, placing a piece of tender bone in his bowl. "I caught it, didn’t I?"
 

 
Everyone thought about it and realized she had a point.
 

 
Wei Zekai was completely wrapped up in her logic. With a large piece of bone in his bowl, he angrily picked it up to chew. This scene, witnessed by his friends, along with the dog on the big screen...
 

 
Ah, of course.
 

 
The one who loves bones is a dog.
 

 
The meat attached to the bone is the best part, so delicious that Wei Zekai’s mood stabilized a bit. He then heard his mother chuckling, commenting, "Xiao Kai is still as ticklish as he was when he was a child; how cute."
 

 
He looked up to see himself being searched by Tong Zhao, making soft, playful dog sounds.
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t believe he had this side to him.
 

 
Even if he had become a dog, he should be cool and handsome!
 

 
…
 

 
Deep breath, deep breath.
 

 
That’s a dog, that’s a dog, not him.
 

 
Next, the scene depicted Tong Zhao using her words to uncover the truth about Wei Zekai, the dog.
 

 
Second Generation A: "Hahaha, look at Boss's expression when the insider disrupts the deal—it's so vivid!"
 

 
Every time Wei's father saw this scene, he felt uncomfortable.
 

 
He quietly complained to his wife, "I told you to only have one child. Look at others with siblings competing against each other; which one didn't grow up to be clever? But our son, just a few words, and he shows his true colors—he’s really a sweet potato!"
 

 
"Have a couple more. Three brothers can take turns starting businesses; you won't be able to retire even at eighty."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Wei’s father was startled by the idea of not being able to retire at eighty and obediently fell silent for a while.
 

 
The big screen continued to show the epic battle between man and dog.
 

 
When Wei Zekai saw Tong Zhao pulling him over while he quickly tried to retreat, he exclaimed with the same surprise as the character in the scene: "This reaction speed of mine is wasted if I don’t go pro; it’s amazing."
 

 
…
 

 
Then he heard himself imagining Tong Zhao's lips were soft.
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Tong Zhao, let me explain."
 

 
The second generations chimed in: "We want to hear too."
 

 
Wei Zekai felt guilty; he was actually thinking about his brother!
 

 
However, before he could explain, he heard the Tong Zhao from the variety show teasing him, both confessing and seducing. This development was shocking—the two people on screen were ones he knew very well, yet they were playing out a fantastical scenario he had never even dreamed of. Fortunately, from the audience's perspective, he could hear Tong Zhao's inner thoughts, knowing that it was all an act.
 

 
He teasingly whispered to her, "I consider you a brother, and you want to get with me?”
 

 
This time, it was Tong Zhao who lost her composure.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "What did he say?"
 

 
Concubine Chen: "I’m going to morally kidnap a man???"
 

 
Concubine Chen: "He thinks I’m pretty good? Is he giving me a ‘nice guy’ card???"
 

 
Lu Xianzhang chuckled lightly: "This kid isn’t bad."
 

 
Tong Zhao subtly pressed her temple: "Okay, enough. My thought process isn’t the same as regular people; you all know that."
 

 
Concubine Chen was both shy and angry, huffing as she turned to leave.
 

 
However, the next heartfelt confession from Wei Zekai in the variety show instantly elevated the atmosphere of the gathering.
 

 
With the elders and friends as witnesses, Wei Zekai watched himself kiss her. This was followed by a long, passionate dog food kiss.
 

 
The expression on Wei Zekai's face was blank, and his mind was blank too.
 

 
Is this content playable? He had never expected this kind of plot!He saw Tong Zhao holding his chin with one hand, teasing him with a smile: "Elementary school student.”
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai: "How about we just watch a family-friendly movie instead?"
 

 
Second Generation A: "Very open-minded."
 

 
Second Generation B: "Feel free to roast."
 

 
Second Generation C: "No need to be embarrassed."
 

 
All echoes of Wei's earlier arrogant remarks from half an hour ago.
 

 
Tong Zhao timely added, "A rare family activity."
 

 
With his own words thrown back at him, Wei Zekai could only sit there uncomfortably until the end.
 

 
He finally understood why the staff looked at him with sympathy when he woke up from the holographic chamber.
 

 
They had laughed enough, and everyone enjoyed the hot pot together.
 

 
But the young master was left completely shattered in his views.
 

 
Such variety shows were common; compared to more traditional parents, everyone didn’t really think the two were in a relationship. After dinner, the elders said they wouldn’t disturb the kids, telling them to treat the place like home and have fun. Once the parents left, they unleashed their teasing towards the Boss like wild horses.
 

 
Wei Zekai, annoyed by the comments, said, "Looking at that scene felt like watching a stranger who looks exactly like me. No feeling, no sense of connection!”
 

 
He truly believed this from the bottom of his heart.
 

 
And because he spoke so confidently, his friends understood and believed him too.
 

 
...
 

 
That night, he gradually began to recall the details from that time.
# Chapter51
Acting in the 'Instinct' movie was a very strange experience.
 

 
When most people first watch the rough cuts after stepping out of the holographic pod, they usually think it's like an AI face-swapping program: 'I definitely didn't do that' or 'Haha, no way I could have done that.' But when they wake up in the middle of the night, with everything silent around them, and memories begin to resurface, that's when the reality of it sinks in.
 

 
So, actors with some experience don't speak so definitively.
 

 
Wei Zekai didn't know this.
 

 
Not only did he speak too definitively, but he also acted overly confident.
 

 
That night, Wei Zekai was tossing and turning on his king-size bed.
 

 
One of the benefits of being wealthy is that when you can’t sleep and you're rolling around in bed, you don't have to worry about falling off the edge. His memories started to return in stages: first, he remembered being dragged over, and then he remembered the first time he secretly kissed his close friend...
 

 
‘Ah…’
 

 
Classmate Wei knelt on his bed, hugging his head with both hands, banging his head against the mattress.
 

 
He was trying to knock out the embarrassing memories by banging his head.
 

 
But it didn’t work—it just made the memories clearer.
 

 
‘Stop thinking about it, Wei Zekai. If you're a man, you’re not allowed to think about it!’
 

 
Wei Zekai tried to command his brain.
 

 
After three minutes of scolding, his brain and mouth still hadn’t reached an agreement.
 

 
That 'relationship' with Tong Zhao had completely consumed him. With each bang of his head, the memories slowly resurfaced. Back then, he had responded to a girl’s affection for the first time, wanting to be good to her, feeling foolish yet overjoyed. The more he banged his head, the more pink bubbles seemed to pop up. Wei Zekai honestly just wanted to die.
 

 
At six in the morning, he recalled enthusiastically making breakfast, only to find she had left. The official statement informed him he had been tricked.
 

 
Tong Zhao had never chosen him as her romantic interest.
 

 
"The girl he had loved was fake.”
 

 
And then he wanted to die even more.
 

 
Having grown up in a warm, loving, sheltered family, Wei Zekai had developed a low tolerance for emotional pain. Coupled with his first experience of 'heartbreak,' he couldn't handle the overwhelming sense of betrayal and immediately broke down, crying out loud. At that moment, he remembered Tong Zhao once mentioned that she had a strange habit of waking up at 6 a.m. for meditation. So, he reached for his phone from the nightstand and called her.
 

 
'Hello?'
 

 
The call was quickly answered.
 

 
The female voice on the other end was slightly raspy, carrying a hint of drowsy laziness: 'You’re up so early? Didn’t sleep, did you… What's going on? Calling me and banging your head, are you giving me such a grand salute, young master?' She chuckled lightly, having heard the rhythmic thumping from his end.
 

 
'I couldn’t sleep. I have insomnia. I wasn’t bowing to you; I was trying to knock you out of my head.'
 

 
Wei Zekai's tone was full of resentment.
 

 
It was so amusing that Tong Zhao, despite being a bit grumpy from waking up, couldn't help but laugh: 'If you're sick, go get treatment.'
 

 
Wei Zekai sniffled and asked, 'No, seriously, I just want to know... on the variety show, did you ever like me? I’m really stuck on this. I’m so miserable.'
 

 
Before, when staff and friends said he was miserable, he didn’t feel it.
 

 
What misery? He had money, looks, a smooth life, and good health.
 

 
He never expected to be blindsided by the pain of love.
 

 
'It was just a variety show,' Tong Zhao tried to snap him out of it.
 

 
'I just want to know.'
 

 
Like everyone inexperienced in love, after a breakup, he was obsessed with whether the other person had ever truly loved him.
 

 
Seeing how pitiful he sounded, still crying, Tong Zhao called over the 'silent' Concubine Chen to help get him an answer.
 

 
Concubine Chen was merciless: [That little puppy? Pretty cute. Keep him around for a few years, and maybe I’d grow to like him.]"
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Ah, well...]
 

 
After thinking for a while, Tong Zhao said to Wei Zekai, "I did like you that night, but because the script required me to leave right after completing the task, if the show hadn’t ended, I had planned to come back and continue things with you."
 

 
The personalities in her mind, who had witnessed everything and knew the truth, all laughed at her gentleness.
 

 
Duan Ge pointed and commented: [He needed to experience the dangers of love, so he won’t be deceived by another woman in the future.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang agreed: [The emotional lessons he has to learn won’t be few; it’s just a matter of when they happen.]
 

 
[Hahaha,] Concubine Chen, who had been woken up by Tong Zhao, was even more cutting than usual: [One who’s never been in love and another whose husband took her Golden Core, slashing her from shoulder to thigh, are giving love advice—this is hilarious.]
 

 
Tong Zhao pressed her temples, trying to quiet the noisy voices in her head.
 

 
After hearing what she said, Wei Zekai was clearly much happier: "I know the *Instinct* variety show shouldn’t be mixed up with reality, and I didn’t have any improper thoughts about my friend, but… it was still my first love, right? If you had no feelings for me at all, I’d feel a bit sad. Now that I’ve heard what you said, I feel relieved and sleepy. I’m going to sleep now, and if I pass out, the next time we meet will probably be tonight. You can tell them they can leave without saying goodbye to me..."
 

 
'Wait a second,' Wei Zekai remembered something: 'You might as well stay here. That place you rented is so rundown anyway.'
 

 
'I just moved,' Tong Zhao reminded him.
 

 
"From completely unlivable to barely acceptable—I really worry about you living in such a place!"
 

 
"You're ridiculous."
 

 
Tong Zhao felt she had spoiled him too much. She smiled and scolded him before hanging up the phone.
 

 
※
 

 
After leaving Wei’s house, Tong Zhao immediately jumped into a whirlwind of nonstop work commitments.
 

 
Compared to her current schedule, filming the variety show now seemed like a vacation.
 

 
The perfume endorsement deal they had previously agreed on entered the shooting phase. Half of it involved her appearing in real life, and the other half reused the model of 'Han Zhi.' Once again, she acted out a self-directed, self-acted scenario in the commercial. The plot was simple—Han Zhi is a bartender at a bar, and every time he leans over the counter to pour drinks for customers, they catch the faint scent of [Midnight Lover] on him. The oceanic incense mixed with his strikingly handsome and devilish appearance draws the attention of a crazed admirer, A.
 

 
The admirer begins following Han Zhi after his shifts. At first, she only wanted to watch him go home and learn where he lived. But after Han Zhi entered his apartment, A remained outside, torn between conflicting emotions. Through post-production effects, the ingredients of the perfume are revealed beside A as she gazes at the apartment door.
 

 
A wants to confess her love to Han Zhi.
 

 
Unable to control herself any longer, A goes upstairs and knocks on the door.
 

 
But the person who opens the door is a stunningly beautiful woman, wearing a red camisole nightdress, her eyes half-open as she looks at the masked and hooded figure. A steps back in shock. The masculine scent that had filled her mind is replaced by the woman’s rich rose fragrance. It’s clearly an inappropriate perfume for bedtime, but it feels perfectly suited to this woman, who seems to radiate vibrant, bold charm 24 hours a day.
 

 
A mistakenly believes Tong Zhao is Han Zhi’s girlfriend, and in a fit of jealousy and rage, kills her.
 

 
After breaking into Han Zhi’s apartment, A discovers a room full of disguise tools.
 

 
By day, Han Zhi was the beautiful female violinist in the café, and by night, the handsome bartender at the bar."
 

 
“The commercial ends with a bouquet of roses that A had sent to Han Zhi at work, placed carefully in a glass vase, blooming vibrantly next to a wig. As the emotionally distraught A punches the dining table, the camera freezes on a particularly large rose falling onto the table.
 

 
...
 

 
After the commercial shoot, they moved on to the corresponding print ads. For Tong Zhao, makeup and styling were easy since she had a good foundation and took great care of herself. The makeup artist praised her skin: 'Some people your age need to apply an intense hydrating mask before makeup just to prevent it from caking.'
 

 
Once her makeup was done, Tong Zhao stepped in front of the camera and handed the hard work over to Han Zhi.
 

 
The most satisfying part of the cheat left behind by the system was the ability to share tasks.
 

 
Wei Zekai, back in middle school, once fantasized with her about how great it would be if there were two of him—one to do homework, while the other played video games. Tong Zhao pointed out that if there were two of him, they’d both just end up playing games.
 

 
Thankfully, through the various worlds she traveled, Tong Zhao had developed the habit of not shying away from trouble.
 

 
Han Zhi was speechless: [I’ve only ever shot men’s fashion editorials. I’ve never done a photo shoot as a female star.]
 

 
In the fast-travel worlds where Han Zhi had become a top-tier influencer, he dominated luxury brand endorsements with his handsome Chinese features. Whether the style was mature and warm or cold and edgy, he could easily pull it off. Just standing in front of the camera, even the smallest expression could 'murder' storage space with the number of photos taken. Shooting him was an effortless joy.
 

 
Tong Zhao flattered him: [You have the experience! You can do it!]
 

 
Well, Han Zhi couldn't resist a woman's request.
 

 
As Tong Zhao had said, he quickly adapted to shooting in a woman's body, and the results were incredible—sultry, striking, yet with a razor-sharp edge. The photographer hired by the brand was also top-notch and clicked with him immediately. After the shoot, the photographer praised her to Tong Zhao's agent: 'If these two perfumes sell exceptionally well, your girl deserves the top credit.'
 

 
'You’re that confident even before post-production?'"
 

 
Sister Chu smiled, feeling more joy when her artist was praised than when receiving compliments herself.
 

 
'Post-production doesn’t really affect Tong Zhao’s face. She can shine even with the raw footage.'
 

 
The person being praised like a goddess was currently removing her heavy makeup from the shoot and switching to a subtle, carefully thought-out look that could handle being captured by passersby. Afterward, Sister Chu sat down beside her to talk about work: 'I have one good news and one bad news. The good news is that after “Sea King’s Kill’, almost every variety show with an open slot has extended an olive branch to you. Even those with no open spots would immediately bump off someone with less star power if you showed interest.'
 

 
'And the bad news?'
 

 
'The bad news is, I don’t think it’s good for you to take on too many variety shows. Doing a few here and there is fine, but you have a lot of potential left in film. There’s no need to let the audience pigeonhole you as a variety show star. Aside from the survival show on the deserted island you’ve already committed to, I plan to turn down the rest. What do you think?'
 

 
After speaking, Sister Chu looked at Tong Zhao for her opinion.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had a certain amount of leverage when she signed with the company after the success of “The Ming Emperor Chronicles”, she had bargaining power. She didn’t want to become a puppet for the company, so even though Sister Chu spoke firmly, in the end, she still needed Tong Zhao’s agreement.
 

 
Sister Chu had prepared herself for Tong Zhao to be unhappy.
 

 
Tong Zhao: 'Hmm, understood.'
 

 
'...'
 

 
Sister Chu, who had prepared countless explanations, was stunned: 'You… don’t want to at least see which variety shows invited you?'
 

 
Even though the company had held a meeting to discuss Tong Zhao’s future direction, and Sister Chu was sure that she shouldn’t waste too much time on variety shows, Tong Zhao’s quick acceptance still caught her off guard.
 

 
'First, I trust your professional judgment and skills. Second, my schedule is only going to get busier. If I didn’t trust you, it would mean I’d have to review all the offers you’ve already gone through, wasting both time and energy. In that case, why would I have signed with the company? I could have just gone solo. I don’t care about what offers you’ve turned down; I’m only interested in knowing what resources you think are suitable for me.'
 

 
“The principle of trust: If you hire someone, trust them. If you have doubts, don’t hire them."
 

 
After listening to Tong Zhao’s explanation, the smile on Sister Chu's face became noticeably more genuine.
 

 
'There is a good project,' Sister Chu said, handing her a script. 'Take a look. If you're interested after reading it, we can arrange a meal with the screenwriter.'
 

 
The title on the cover read “Heartless Tribulation” in black text on a white background.
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted the script and glanced at her.
 

 
Sister Chu quickly explained, 'It’s not a shady dinner, I promise. If you're worried, we can meet in a public place...'
 

 
'A private room is fine,' Tong Zhao replied. Given her current level of fame, meeting in a public place would just invite attention. 'But usually, don’t people meet the director or the investors?'
 

 
'The screenwriter is the investor.'
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the script, and the screenwriter's name was written on the first page: Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
'That name seems familiar...'
 

 
Tong Zhao searched the name on Weibo, and sure enough, she found a post she had once come across and remembered.
 

 
At the time, “72 Hours Countdown” had just aired, and Shi Qianqiu had praised the film highly. Xu Zhu, on the show “Star Girl”, had voiced that Shi Qianqiu was the director she admired the most and hoped for a dream collaboration with him.
 

 
However, Shi Qianqiu’s response turned the situation into something surreal: 'Xu Zhu? I’m quite puzzled as to why she is so fixated on playing noble and sweet characters. Her true nature, from what I’ve seen in her subconscious, is the most selfish and base I’ve encountered. She’d certainly excel in that area. Besides Tong Zhao, she was the person I admired most in “72 Hours Countdown”. Most people can’t be so shamelessly selfish, but she pulls it off. She’s truly unique.'
 

 
"She's truly unique."
 

 
"I admire her the most."
 

 
Taken individually, these two statements were the praises Xu Zhu dreamed of.
 

 
But when put together...
 

 
In any case, this meant that Xu Zhu would no longer be able to ride on the fame of this major director on the show.
 

 
It was only now that Tong Zhao searched and realized that Shi Qianqiu had publicly praised her many times.
 

 
When she checked his Weibo, she found he still only followed her.
# Chapter52
Tong Zhao casually clicked "follow back."
 

 
Even if the collaboration didn’t work out in the end, it was worth making friends with a director who admired her.
 

 
'Sister Chu appreciates it, so let’s meet. I’ll take my time reading the script later. Is there anything else?'
 

 
Sister Chu handed her two more scripts.
 

 
Both were tailored for the role of the 'Sea King’s Femme Fatale.' Tong Zhao didn’t want to be typecast—she had many personalities in her memory palace, several of which had never appeared. She had asked the system, and the response was that her current mental energy was limited, insufficient to allow all personalities to emerge simultaneously. Keeping some personalities dormant was intended for her mental health. If she wanted to unlock more of her past, she needed to focus on acting and training!
 

 
According to the system, shooting instinctual films connected her consciousness, serving as a form of mental training.
 

 
It was quite an upgrade.
 

 
'I’m not interested in either of these.'
 

 
Tong Zhao declined, and Sister Chu quickly stopped trying to tell her the benefits of the two scripts, simply saying, 'If there are any types you want to play, let me know, and I’ll keep an eye out. There are actually many good ones; these two were just the most sincere offers.'
 

 
'Fantasy and martial arts would be great.'
 

 
'Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.'
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment and added, 'I don’t want to take on too many emotional roles next time.'
 

 
In recent years, there has been a show titled *What to Do if the Demon Lord Falls in Love with Me at the Same Time*, which tells the story of a matchmaking deity who dozes off and accidentally ties the female lead to two red threads. The other ends of the threads lead to two powerful figures from the righteous and evil realms. The male lead and the male supporting character wage war over her, while the little junior sister just needs to act cute and relax to ascend. The ease of gaining so much without effort while being pursued by two handsome guys is simply too enjoyable. This low-budget drama became a hit for an entire season, and since then, the industry has discovered the formula for success, leading to many more fantasy dramas centered on the competition for the female lead.
 

 
If Lu Xianzhang were to act in a similar drama...
 

 
She would probably feign weakness while secretly enhancing her strength, and when she was powerful enough, she would take out both the male lead and the supporting character with a single sword, then ascend after overcoming the tribulations and confront the matchmaking deity who tangled the red threads...
 

 
As Tong Zhao thought of this, the character of the little junior sister came alive again, cheerfully interjecting, "I’ve even thought of her immortal title! Let’s call her 'The Lonely Immortal.'"
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: "…"
 

 
Duan Ge: "Why not just make a modern cultivation film where she wears a 'kill the man' lipstick and slays all the scumbags?"
 

 
The little junior sister laughed heartily.
 

 
"Sounds good," Sister Chu nodded. "But you really are the most unique artist I’ve ever managed."
 

 
As the assistant finished packing up, the three of them walked to the underground parking lot, where a van would take her to the next promotional venue. Sister Chu continued, "Your subconscious is quite special. The Instinctual Film Association has already listed you as a subject of special attention... Don’t worry, it won’t affect your roles. If you have any psychological needs, they will recommend professionals for you."
 

 
Only then did Tong Zhao retract her worried gaze.
 

 
"Do you really not need a psychologist?" Sister Chu asked.
 

 
"If I need help, I will reach out to you first," Tong Zhao promised.
 

 
Having multiple personalities sounds cool, but it often comes with many negative traits, making one sensitive and suspicious. This was the system's way of protecting her as she experienced long lives across multiple worlds. It was different from traditional dissociative identity disorder, and seeing a psychologist would mostly be ineffective—if it were effective, the doctor would aim to eliminate her symptoms, while she felt there was nothing wrong with having so many personalities and even wanted to unlock more.
 

 
This has nothing to do with acting as a golden finger.
 

 
One person is like a chat group; Tong Zhao has long been accustomed to this unique liveliness.
 

 
Otherwise, who could share those fantastical experiences? How lonely would it be?
 

 
[No matter what happens,]
 

 
Noticing her low mood, Lu Xianchang comforted her: [We will always be here for you.]
 

 
As the elevator to the underground parking garage opened, Tong Zhao was about to say a few words to Lu Xianchang when she unexpectedly faced several dark cameras—reporters who were lurking around. Today, there were other artists in the studio, attracting some tabloid reporters eager to snap photos and write their little essays. The flash momentarily blinded them, and Tong Zhao quickly blinked twice, forcing herself to look at the cameras despite her discomfort.
 

 
The three young reporters took pictures of her emotionless face behind a black mask for a while. When they realized they weren't going to capture any new expressions, they finally pulled their eyes away from the viewfinder. One of them asked, “Isn’t Young Master Wei picking you up for work today?”
 

 
Sister Chu patted her on the shoulder and said, "Let's go.”
 

 
Tong Zhao responded with a sound of acknowledgment and continued walking without glancing aside.
 

 
The three reporters followed behind her, seemingly oblivious to her expression, and walked straight ahead.
 

 
Even without anyone responding, they fired off numerous questions, each with a sensational angle: “I heard someone saw you and Wei Zekai leaving the film set together after filming 'Aquaman Kill.' Are you two together now? Have you met his parents? What do his friends think of you? There are also rumors that you’ve moved; did Wei Zekai pay for it? His name is on the investment list for 'Aquaman Kill,' and it’s said that this variety show was created specifically to boost your popularity.”
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao had no intention of stopping to answer, the reporters continued their rapid-fire questioning while taking quick shots, trying to glean news from her expression. Unfortunately, with their barrage of malicious questions, she didn't even raise an eyebrow, leaving them with no room for speculation.
 

 
The three reporters followed all the way until they watched Tong Zhao get into the plain nanny van. Confirming they wouldn't get any gossip about Wei Zekai picking her up after work, they left reluctantly.
 

 
Once inside the car, the assistant pulled the blackout curtains and muttered, “What a bunch of flies.”
 

 
Sister Chu and Tong Zhao turned to look at her.
 

 
Realizing her mistake, the assistant quickly apologized to her two superiors.
 

 
“It’s fine; they are indeed annoying.”
 

 
As Sister Chu spoke, she complimented Tong Zhao again for her calm and composed demeanor, saying she had the aura of a superstar.
 

 
"They can't get anything out of me, so they just want to provoke me. They would love for me to start yelling and cursing, so they can rush back and write their articles."
 

 
The assistant handed Tong Zhao an eye mask and noise-canceling earplugs. After putting them on, she tried to close her eyes and rest in this brief moment of quiet.
 

 
The reporters were desperate to get a shot of her.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the type who made her manager's job much easier—
 

 
She didn't go clubbing or bar-hopping, leading a nearly ascetic lifestyle at home. Her biggest daily entertainment was brewing a cup of coffee, reading novels, watching live streams of others playing games, and occasionally playing a few rounds of Honor of Kings for practice. Sometimes, while gaming, she would have classical music playing in the background, mixed with the insults from her random teammates on her phone. The juxtaposition of high culture and the lowbrow created a kind of postmodern humor in her bedroom.
 

 
The reporters had no chance of capturing her.
 

 
Not only did they miss out on any embarrassing late-night drunken moments, but even decent street shots were incredibly rare.
 

 
The reporters had been lurking outside her apartment complex for two days, but aside from catching a glimpse of her getting into the nanny car, they had nothing to show for it.
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao had kept her personal life very low-key.
 

 
However, she was never short of news or topics of discussion.
 

 
As that entertainment reporter mentioned, rumors of her relationship with the city’s wealthiest young master circulated when they were spotted leaving the film studio together—his flashy pink sports car was hard to miss even from eight hundred miles away. She didn’t care about the news surrounding her; let them take their photos, let them say whatever they wanted, and let the fans think what they wished. Acknowledging any of it would be conceding defeat in her eyes.
 

 
Knowing that she wouldn’t easily fall asleep, Sister Chu analyzed, “The company previously discouraged you from dating, but now that 'Aquaman Kill' has performed well, everyone is saying you and Wei Zekai have great chemistry. If you really want to date, everything can be arranged. Although he’s a rich second generation, he’s handsome, and the online perception of you dating into wealth won’t be too strong. Saying it’s true love would be very convincing and enhance your public image. Plus, since you don’t want to take on movies with too much romance, it indirectly confirms that you’re in a passionate relationship…”
 

 
“That's nonsense,” Tong Zhao interrupted.
 

 
Tong Zhao waved her hand, “If you say more, I’ll get goosebumps.”
 

 
In fact, these things could be avoided.
 

 
She could tell Wei Zekai to act separately and find ways to avoid any misunderstandings.
 

 
There were countless methods; she could post on Weibo to clarify that she was single, and as long as her fans believed it, that would be enough. As long as there were no photos of them together, the rumors would soon fade…
 

 
But telling one lie requires countless others to cover it up. Tong Zhao planned to act until she could no longer perform and then retire gloriously. Did she want to maintain a persona until she was eighty? Just thinking about it was tragic. It was better to be herself, and her fans should stop fantasizing about a romance with her; that was nonexistent. At least before she secured a prestigious Best Actress award, she wouldn't even consider romance—it was just too troublesome.
 

 
Fans really had a vivid imagination.
 

 
Tong Zhao had many fans, and those who controlled the comments didn't seem too obvious.
 

 
Meanwhile, Wei Zekai was horrified to discover that every time he posted on Weibo, there were always comments urging him to be with Tong Zhao.
 

 
[They’ve moved the civil affairs bureau here, when are you getting your certificate?]
 

 
[It’s really hard to wrap this up if you don’t get married.]
 

 
[Am I shipping a fake couple? I don’t believe it, boohoo!]
 

 
Crazy!
 

 
Wei Zekai racked his brain for a way to clarify their relationship without making it seem like he was the one being rejected.
 

 
@Wei Zekai:
 

 
My dad doesn’t let me date young.
 

 
As a result, the CP fans didn’t disperse at all. A wealthy young heir actually being forbidden from dating? This intriguing tidbit quickly attracted more netizens to discuss it. Wei Zekai’s background was already dug up; he was the heir of Xiangze Group. The official account was flooded with tags, catching the chairman’s attention.
 

 
Chairman Wang didn’t have a Weibo, so he directly sent his secretary to clarify the rumors.
 

 
But how to clarify this?
 

 
The secretary was at a loss and finally decided to handle it officially, retweeting Wei Zekai’s post from the official Xiangze Group account.
 

 
[It is purely a rumor that Chairman Wei prohibits his son from dating. We urge an immediate stop to the spread of false information. Our company reserves the right to pursue legal action for infringement. Let’s start by not believing or spreading rumors!]
 

 
In just one afternoon, Wei Zekai’s original Weibo post was updated with an official label:
 

 
[This is false information and has been addressed. Details >>]
 

 
Wei Zekai was left dumbfounded.
 

 
Netizens below were laughing so hard they were almost in tears, mocking him for being single while passing the blame to his father. His father, in turn, was quick to put the blame back on him, almost giving him a concussion!
 

 
Being laughed at by netizens was one thing, but coming home to a lecture was another.
 

 
"You’ve embarrassed the family! If you’re incompetent, don’t blame your father. I’ve told you not to get addicted to video games; if you played less, you might have a girlfriend by now! What have you achieved playing games every day? Do you think games will just drop a girlfriend into your lap?"
 

 
Wei’s father scolded him. Coincidentally, his uncle had come over to discuss some matters and stayed for dinner, adding fuel to the fire: "Brother-in-law, these days, young people make friends through gaming. I heard from my daughter that she has a popular internet celebrity friend who goes out three times a month, each time to a different server! Xiao Kai, is your gaming skill just that poor?”
 

 
Wei Zekai's heart had already stopped beating from embarrassment, leaving him just a shell of himself sitting there at the dinner table.
 

 
…
 

 
With the help of her agent, Tong Zhao's first meeting with Screenwriter Shi was set in a private room at a five-star hotel restaurant.
 

 
The hotel was located by the river, and from the floor-to-ceiling windows, one could gaze at the luxurious riverside view across.
 

 
Tong Zhao arrived five minutes early, and as soon as she stepped in, a waiter greeted her with a smile, saying that Mr. Shi was waiting for her inside. "Okay, I understand." The upscale restaurant during lunch was filled with patrons quietly conversing, some beautiful girls seizing the moment for selfies, while others noticed Tong Zhao's presence and cast her curious glances.
 

 
Not causing too much commotion, Tong Zhao walked into the private room.
 

 
"Hello, Miss Tong,"
 

 
The afternoon sunlight by the river softly illuminated the man, casting him in shadow and making his features somewhat indistinct. The only clear detail was his model-like physique that the table couldn’t conceal. Upon hearing his cultured and gentle voice, combined with his profession, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but imagine a scholarly face. He rested one hand on the table’s menu, his long, elegant fingers holding a slender electronic cigarette—
 

 
Tong Zhao caught a faint scent of peach blossoms.
 

 
He turned off the electronic cigarette and put it away. "Please have a seat. Would you like to order first?"
 

 
Yuhe Xuan was a Chinese restaurant. After Tong Zhao sat down and exchanged greetings, a tea artist came to pour her a welcoming tea. The light golden liquid, brewed from osmanthus and peony, was poured from a glass pot into a small cup adorned with gold lotus leaves, filling it halfway. The fragrant tea created a warm atmosphere, and the inside of the cup was decorated with six lively red koi, symbolizing good fortune.
 

 
Tong Zhao took the menu and ordered two dishes she was particularly interested in, leaving the rest up to him.
 

 
"Is there anything you can't eat?"
 

 
"Nothing in particular, but I do prefer things a bit on the sweeter side," Tong Zhao honestly shared her preferences, not feeling the need to cater to him just because he was a renowned director.
 

 
"Let's start with a tomato and snow pear soup. At this time of year, you can't miss the drunken hairy crabs. The eel here is served without soy sauce, which balances the sweet and salty flavors nicely, so it's worth trying... By the way, could you block the light a bit? It's a bit too bright."
 

 
At Shi Qianqiu's gesture, the waiter brought over a screen to slightly shield them from the glaring light, and she was finally able to see his face clearly.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had a gentle and refined demeanor.
 

 
His deep black eyes had a hint of flirtation at the corners, adorned with a mole that added a touch of charm to his serious appearance.
 

 
This reminded Tong Zhao of the background information her agent had sent her.
 

 
Unlike the Wei and Tong families, Shi Qianqiu's family was involved in the gray industry, and even earlier, it had been purely black. Their ancestors had been astute enough to wash their reputation and transition to legitimate business, moving from black to gray, with some connections to the Hong Kong side. The information Sister Chu had found was quite limited, but fortunately, Shi Qianqiu himself was not a dangerous individual. He had previously had public spats with several celebrities and influencers due to his straightforwardness, yet he had not been harmed in any way.
 

 
In his films as a screenwriter, he didn't have actors he wanted to work with refusing to come, nor was he ever forced to shoot at gunpoint.
 

 
He wasn’t dangerous, which was why the agent hadn’t outright rejected this opportunity.
 

 
After he politely finished ordering, and the waiter stepped out, he asked, “Have you read my script?”
 

 
"I've read it; it's quite interesting. However, compared to a movie, I think it feels more like a game designed to deliberately challenge players."
 

 
She saw a hint of appreciation in his eyes.
 

 
"One of my dreams is to become a game designer for Souls-like games."
 

 
The most famous Souls-like games, such as ‘Dark Souls’, ‘Bloodborne’, and the widely discussed ‘Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice’, are known for their difficulty—exceedingly difficult.
 

 
Browser games might give you automatic pathfinding and a crit of 9999. Souls-like games also have their own version of a crit of 9999.
 

 
It's just that the small monsters hit the player with a crit of 9999.
 

 
When you die, you'll lose experience, equipment, and money, making the difficulty feel extremely hardcore to Souls-like enthusiasts.
 

 
Why is it hardcore?
 

 
Perhaps it's because their brains can withstand the constant hits from monsters, enduring the cold and ruthless game design.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded. "I can sense that from the script you wrote."
 

 
‘The Heartless Tribulation’ has a straightforward main plot.
 

 
It's a dual-protagonist film centered around a pair of Daoist partners.
 

 
The male and female protagonists are fated to be each other's companions, achieving great results through their dual cultivation. In the past, the male lead married the female lead, who only had a mid-tier fire spirit root, to enhance his cultivation. After obtaining a method for killing his wife to attain enlightenment, he encountered a suitable match, but the troubled female supporting character, harboring jealousy, led the male lead to take all the benefits. She trapped the female lead in a water prison with a life-swapping curse, forcing her to wait in fear, despair, and resentment for seven days until her death.
 

 
The female lead escapes the water prison while severely injured, descends the mountain to survive, and finds a way to seek revenge.
 

 
The only way to break the life-swapping curse is to crush the mother curse hidden in the heart of the female supporting character.
 

 
Desperate not to die in the wilderness and give her enemies an advantage, the female lead must return.
 

 
The only way to break the deadlock in the script is for the female lead to overcome her inner demons and find the legendary sword of severing emotions, sealed for a thousand years…
 

 
Tong Zhao: "There’s a high chance the female lead will die right at the start. Every time a full-dome movie is reshot, it costs a fortune."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I have plenty of money."
 

 
Tong Zhao doesn’t doubt this at all.
 

 
"I used to dream of being a writer," Shi Qianqiu naturally shifted to what seemed like an unrelated topic. "I wrote suspense novels on Jinjiang, with a grand scope. Every character was filled with doubt, and the protagonist was constantly threatened by death. Readers said each chapter was thrilling and exciting, eagerly anticipating how the subplots would be resolved and how those seemingly unsolvable problems would be tackled…”
 

 
"And then?"
 

 
The dishes were served.
 

 
Tong Zhao sipped her tea while listening to him speak.
 

 
"And then I realized I couldn’t turn it around, and I messed up."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu spread his hands, looking helpless yet candid.
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Ah, I really didn’t see that coming."
 

 
From the rhythm of their conversation, it seemed Shi Qianqiu had a talent for writing humorous novels.
 

 
"Back then, readers said the challenges I designed were really engaging. They also expected my protagonists to accomplish the impossible, to do things that were logical yet unexpected..."
 

 
"So, working with the instinctive filmmaking is quite interesting. I just need to focus on designing the challenges, and I’m very confident in that.”
 

 
"When I saw 'Countdown 72 Hours,' despite the critical NPC dying, you still managed to bring the movie to a successful conclusion,"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s originally gentle tone became filled with excitement, and his gaze toward her sparkled with enthusiasm, as if he viewed her like a game designer admires a top player, feeling that only she understands him: "It really touched me. You are the player... ah, I mean, the actress I've been looking for."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought: [System, he must have a lot in common with you.]
 

 
The system did not respond to her remark.
 

 
"Have you found the lead actor yet?"
 

 
She asked.
 

 
In this script, if viewed from the male protagonist's perspective, it’s a typical story of toxic masculinity, where he ascends, gets rich, and swaps wives—essentially fulfilling the three great joys of life.
 

 
Such a malicious subconscious is something most people truly can't handle.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu nodded happily and mentioned a name.
 

 
"Don't worry, what I, Shi Qianqiu, love most is paying attention to those uniquely styled subconscious elements. The lead in last year's hit slasher film 'Don't Look Back on Rainy Nights' was someone I recommended to Director Zhang."
 

 
At this point, he sighed regretfully, filled with sorrow over lost talent: "I initially wanted to give that supporting role to Xu Zhu, who played Feng Sisi. It was so perfect for her! Unfortunately, her manager rejected it after hearing about the character's traits and positioning. I really thought it suited her."
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was eating bamboo fungus, almost laughed and bit her tongue.
 

 
The meal was enjoyable for both host and guest. Through their conversation, Tong Zhao discovered that Shi Qianqiu was a very thoughtful screenwriter. His understanding of instinctive filmmaking possessed a level of innovation that many directors and screenwriters transitioning from traditional cinema lacked.
 

 
"The more you try to control, the more likely the performance will fall apart."
 

 
"The screenwriter can only lay out the framework and provide guidance. Rather than hoping actors follow your intentions, it’s better to understand what kind of actor you need and what their personality is like."
 

 
"Whoever performs better among the two leads will get more screen time. If one tries to dominate, the protagonist might end up being a supporting character. The male lead was aware of this possibility before signing the contract. He is very confident that no matter who I cast, they won't overshadow him."
 

 
"But I think you, Tong Zhao, should give it a try."
 

 
Tong Zhao felt quite excited listening to him.
 

 
This filming style suits her perfectly.
 

 
As for the plot...
 

 
"It's a bit similar to your past experience with Lu Xianchang. Do you want to take it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
She actually didn't like that memory very much.
 

 
That time was truly disastrous; she had just arrived and was in a state of bloody agony, feeling worse than death. The original character's memories were filled with sorrow and resentment, so the personality formed after experiencing that world was one of the least similar to Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
In cultivating immortality, one seeks to understand the heart and the path, fearing karma the most.
 

 
A magnanimous person can smile and let go of grudges, but unfortunately, Lu Xianchang hasn’t smiled since he suffered that life-threatening blow from his husband.
 

 
She only believes in a sword to resolve grudges.
 

 
Lu Xianchang said, "What harm is there in cutting once more?”
# Chapter53
Tong Zhao just nodded to confirm the schedule, and the promotion for "Heartless Tribulation" immediately kicked off.
 

 
This project had been in the pipeline for far too long.
 

 
She was added to the crew group, and before she could even send a message saying "Hello everyone, please take care of me," the chat was flooded with responses—
 

 
Director Zeng: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
Ding Jiao: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
…
 

 
Aside from the assistant director, the male lead, and the female supporting role, the rest were important cast members and crew.
 

 
With such a grand title thrown on her, Tong Zhao found it hard to distinguish whether it was genuine admiration or just flattery.
 

 
Fortunately, Ding Jiao, who plays the female supporting role, immediately stepped in to explain: "Brother Qiu couldn't find a satisfactory female lead. Over the years, he tried several times to hold open auditions for newcomers... but every time the female lead ended up dying in the water dungeon. If it weren't for finding you, we’d still be waiting. Although our schedules are free during the wait, no other production can compare to Brother Qiu’s!"
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng: "Brother Qiu's business skills are top-notch! [thumbs up][thumbs up]"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It's mainly about this! [gold coin][gold coin]"
 

 
Everyone burst into laughter.
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu had a gray industry background, the crew members seemed completely unafraid of him. It was just that the assistant director particularly listened to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Tong Zhao privately teased him about this, and Shi Qianqiu readily explained: "It's because he used to be addicted to gambling and ended up owing me several thousand.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "A few thousand? Really?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "A few million! [heart]"
 

 
...Alright.
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted "Heartless Tribulation," and the news of her collaboration with the renowned director Shi Qianqiu spread quickly.
 

 
The entertainment industry changes rapidly; someone who debuted a year ago is already considered a senior. When "Heartless Tribulation" was initially casting, it created quite a buzz, but after being delayed for some time, netizens struggled to recall what it was about. Fans cheered as their "sister" landed another major project, until they saw Shi Qianqiu's name, along with marketing accounts reminding them of the movie's delays—
 

 
"The fourth female lead selection flopped just three minutes into filming; the longest anyone lasted was ten minutes."
 

 
"The director known for making things difficult for actors: Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
"Shi Qianqiu: I recognized Tong Zhao's ability to solve problems."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu's words didn't seem like a mere evaluation of an actor.
 

 
Since the rise of instinctive films, two schools of thought have emerged in the directing community.
 

 
One emphasizes a highly detailed setting to ensure actors stay on the predetermined plot, striving to achieve traditional film effects during the era of instinctive cinema. This school's prominent director, Chen Shengwen, once said, "The only benefit of instinctive films is the ability to create holographic viewing experiences and grand scenes that reality cannot achieve; otherwise, there would be no point in their existence.”
 

 
The other approach is like Shi Qianqiu’s, believing that instinctive films should be shot from a completely new perspective.
 

 
"Shi Qianqiu: I see a new era in Tong Zhao."
 

 
...
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu genuinely looks forward to Tong Zhao’s professional abilities, his handsome face alone could have earned him a direct debut in acting. Thus, he became another name in her long list of rumors, and "Heartless Tribulation" was touted as their powerful collaboration.
 

 
But it wasn’t true; it didn’t exist.
 

 
Aside from work-related matters, Tong Zhao hadn’t been contacted privately by Director Shi.
 

 
Soon, "Heartless Tribulation" was restarted, and the cast gathered on the twenty-third floor of the studio.
 

 
Everything was ready.
 

 
The set modeling had already been completed; all that was missing was the female lead.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi, who played the male lead, had a strikingly handsome and resolute face. Having just turned thirty, he looked incredibly well-maintained and appeared to be in his mid-twenties—a very classic handsome man.
 

 
As soon as Tong Zhao arrived, he greeted her with a smile: "I’ve been waiting for you! This is the first time I’m looking forward to my opponent so much. I just hope I won’t lose all my scenes."
 

 
This was quite different from his confident demeanor in front of Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
"Better not go too hard on me, senior.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's humble reaction surprised Chen Zhuzhi a bit.
 

 
He had observed her previous works, and although her characters in "Countdown 72 Hours," "The Legend of Ming Emperor," and "King of the Sea" seemed vastly different in personality, they shared common traits—she was very proud, strong-willed, and openly aggressive. He speculated that when there were men to rely on, she would prefer to use them, but when they were unreliable, she could depend on herself.
 

 
Like Han Zhi, Chen Zhuzhi categorized Tong Zhao as a difficult woman.
 

 
From "Countdown 72 Hours," he could tell she would be a formidable opponent.
 

 
The contract stated that whoever performed better would be the real lead.
 

 
If one underperformed, they might lose a third of their scenes.
 

 
That was an outcome Chen Zhuzhi could not accept.
 

 
Unlike Tong Zhao, three years ago, Chen Zhuzhi faced a scandal when an ex-girlfriend reported him for domestic violence, costing him a hefty settlement. Many of his female fans left, and those who remained were somewhat clueless. However, he gradually started receiving offers for negative roles, opening up a new path for himself. Yet no film had cast him as the male lead, and "Heartless Tribulation" was his one and only opportunity.
 

 
"The downside of instinctive films is that you can’t even give the little fairy a break without losing control.”
 

 
He said this, yet ever since learning about the female lead, he had been subtly expressing his dislike for her. Instinctive films can be influenced by subconscious feelings; for instance, during "The Legend of Ming Emperor," Song Wanzhu almost left the project after a poor first impression of Tong Zhao during her audition.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi not only didn’t want to go easy on her, but also aimed to be ruthless.
 

 
Though he felt a bit guilty about the young woman, he was determined to secure the male lead role.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" had faced too many failures in casting a female lead, and Chen Zhuzhi had been persuading Shi Qianqiu to abandon the dual-lead concept and turn it into his own showcase. Shi Qianqiu had even considered it, and Tong Zhao was his last choice; if he could make her fail, his solo plan would succeed.
 

 
After all, with Tong Zhao’s current popularity, she wouldn’t lack for opportunities!
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled but said nothing.
 

 
Just then, others also wanted to chat with the rising star, and Chen Zhuzhi's feigned compliment was smoothly brushed aside.
 

 
“Zhao Zhao, I really loved your performance as Feng Yanqi!”
 

 
Ding Jiao, true to her name, was a petite girl who usually played spoiled characters. Her family ran a substantial business in another city, and she had grown up with everything going her way, so she had never faced hardship. This made her portrayals of entitled roles particularly realistic. Shi Qianqiu occasionally lamented in the group chat that while Ding Jiao was charming, she lacked the venomous edge; if only they could have Xu Zhu instead.
 

 
Ding Jiao hesitated for a long time about whether she should be angry. In the end, her girlfriends privately advised her not to let this exceptionally difficult person get to her, so she decided to act like she didn’t see it.
 

 
She wasn’t being malicious at all!
 

 
“Then I’m really happy!”
 

 
When the girl complimented her, Tong Zhao smiled, this time genuinely.
 

 
Though she hadn’t been in the industry long, her performances had been so successful that she stood out among her peers. Ding Jiao had debuted earlier and, while envious of her luck, recognized that there were roles Tong Zhao could play that she couldn’t. With no rivalry, admiration took its place.
 

 
If Tong Zhao could perform well, it would benefit everyone!
 

 
“I actually wanted to add you in the group for a while, but I was a bit shy. I thought it would feel more sincere to add you after we met and greeted each other,” Ding Jiao said, pulling her hand to exchange WeChat contacts.
 

 
Ding Jiao stuck out her pink tongue and smiled, revealing cute dimples on her cheeks.
 

 
She really did seem well-protected.
 

 
“I also watched ‘King of the sea,’ and I thought you might be even more charming in person.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “Huh? Am I not charming enough right now? I’m wearing makeup.”
 

 
Though she said that, she actually knew the reason.
 

 
Tong Zhao was still dressed low-key today.
 

 
She wore a black shirt with jeans, neatly tied her hair back in a ponytail, and donned a cap that could be pulled down to shade half her face. From a distance, all that could be seen were her elegant jawline and supple lips, making her the coolest sight on the street.
 

 
With the aura given to her by the Concubine Chen, she could easily overshadow everyone.
 

 
If she always appeared with feminine charm, it would eventually become tiresome. So unless her agent insisted on stealing the spotlight for a press event, she prioritized comfort in her outfits, opting for whatever felt best, maybe adding some cute accessories.
 

 
Like the black cap she wore, which had a pair of pointy cat ears on top.
 

 
When talking to her, Ding Jiao couldn't help but glance up, thinking she was just too cute!
 

 
She hadn’t expected Tong Zhao to be so adorably cool in person.
 

 
“Ah, it’s not that I think you’re unattractive!” Ding Jiao shook her head, frustrated with her poor expression skills. “Your features are beautiful, really; only a blind person would say otherwise. But it feels different from what I see on camera…”
 

 
Tong Zhao found the girl a bit amusing.
 

 
She smiled and asked, “In ‘King of the Sea’, do you prefer Han Zhi or Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Ding Jiao immediately displayed an embarrassed expression, clearly caught off guard.
 

 
“Ahem, I’m a fan of Han Zhi’s girlfriend…”
 

 
In Tong Zhao's mind, her other personas laughed at how popular Han Zhi was.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Underestimated, brother Zhi should show her a thing or two.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Okay.]
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, in Ding Jiao's eyes, the person in front of her seemed to change.
 

 
It was an invisible transformation that only the one being looked at could feel, something only the top traditional actors could achieve—though Ding Jiao wasn't sure, as traditional films had been declining for a long time.
 

 
Tong Zhao was already taller than her, and today she wore thick heels, making her almost a head taller.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao lowered her head, her thin lips lifting into a casual smile. Her light-colored eyes sparkled like intoxicating nectar, and the indoor lighting reflected in them, creating a starlit effect: “What about me? Don’t you like me?”
 

 
Ding Jiao felt a rush from her gaze, her ears tingling.
 

 
A woman in love wouldn’t mistake her boyfriend; that feeling belonged to her brother Zhi!
 

 
“Love, love, love!” she raised her hand in a threefold declaration of affection.
 

 
Unfortunately, that feeling faded in an instant. Tong Zhao patted her head, saying, “It doesn’t matter if you like me; I’m straight.”
 

 
“I’m straight too,” Ding Jiao retorted, covering the spot that was patted.
 

 
After that little interaction, their relationship truly became much closer. Ding Jiao was curious about the way Tong Zhao’s demeanor could change so quickly, but she liked both versions: “Ah, I always wanted that heart-fluttering feeling in a relationship, and I didn’t expect to find it in a woman. If you ever decide to change genders, you have to tell me; I’ll bring the civil affairs bureau over!”
 

 
“You have some dangerous thoughts.”
 

 
They lay in front of the holographic filming pod, and Ding Jiao kept chattering away.
 

 
Tong Zhao had to let Lu Xianzhang know in advance, so she turned to Lu Xianzhang for some company.
 

 
“Can I gossip a bit?”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “Sure.”
 

 
“Are you and Wei Zekai for real?”
 

 
Ding Jiao had heard from her dad that the Wei family was incredibly wealthy, much richer than hers.
 

 
If she were to compete for Wei Zekai, she felt she wouldn’t stand a chance.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang frowned slightly, feeling uncomfortable: “It’s fake.”
 

 
She could distinguish who her friends were, but she still had a deep-rooted resistance to men.
 

 
“That’s good; no rush to date. Nowadays, guys are just too immature. I still feel something for the Han Zhi you portrayed. Wuu, I love him so much…”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “...Thanks, but maybe love yourself a bit more.”
 

 
At this moment, the equipment started to operate, and their consciousness gradually became blurred.

"Heartless Tribulation"
 

 
[Main Characters]
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi as: Shao Xuanzheng
 

 
Tong Zhao as: Mu Yingchen
 

 
Ding Jiao as: Li Qiaoqiao
 

 
---
 

 
Tick, tick...
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her eyelids heavy, and pain radiated from her limbs.
 

 
The good news was that her legs hurt a bit less.
 

 
She gritted her teeth, forcing herself to open her eyes and look down.
 

 
The bad news was that the reason it hurt less was because they were submerged in ice-cold water.
 

 
Tong Zhao found herself in a water prison, surrounded by solid stone walls. Looking up, she saw a reservoir above. Water was slowly trickling in through an inlet, gradually rising in the prison... Compared to when she was first locked in, the water level had risen significantly. She estimated that in about seven days, it would reach her mouth and nose, drowning her.
 

 
The chains binding her had a mechanism that tightened slowly, restricting her movement bit by bit.
 

 
When she was first locked in, Tong Zhao could still sit and lie down to rest.
 

 
Later, as the water level rose higher and reached her calves, she could only sit.
 

 
Then…
 

 
She had already been standing for a whole day.
 

 
In front of Tong Zhao was a high platform with a sword on it.
 

 
The sword was the most ordinary kind, forged by a mortal blacksmith, and could not cut the chains that bound her.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng said to her, "My path is to leave a way out in everything; this sword is your only means of escape."
 

 
It hinted that this was a sword for her to use to end her own life.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had schemed and drugged her, shattering her golden core when she was at her weakest. Her spiritual roots were also severely damaged, making it difficult to channel spiritual energy. She had only a trace of spiritual aura protecting her, barely avoiding the issues that arose from being submerged for too long, but the pain was relentless.
 

 
To achieve the desired effect, Lu Xianzhang signaled Tong Zhao to voluntarily sign a contract refusing the pain waiver.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that she didn't need to push herself so hard.
 

 
She believed this was a good opportunity to cultivate her heart again—instinctive films were like the illusionary seas of the past in the cultivation world. If she turned on the pain waiver effect, it wouldn’t be as effective; without the bone-deep pain, how could one truly be tempered by fire? This was also why she particularly disagreed with dual cultivation; enjoying the merging of desires might enhance cultivation, but it lacked the process of refining the heart, which would eventually lead to stumbling over inner demons.
 

 
At that moment, the staff of "The Heartless Tribulation" were observing the scene.
 

 
The set designer quietly complained, "Even if Tong Zhao said she doesn't need the pain waiver, brother Shi, you shouldn't have agreed so readily! Several actors who had the pain waiver before couldn't handle it and chose to end their lives. If we scare off the leading actress on the first shot, we'll have to wait again."
 

 
The leading actress was afflicted with a life-exchanging curse; if she ended her own life, the effect would be even better.
 

 
To some extent, it would also reduce the karmic burdens entangling Shao Xuanzheng.
 

 
After activating a 50% pain waiver, the pain would be significantly alleviated.
 

 
However, the set was incredibly oppressive, accompanied by constant water sounds and rising water levels. Even actresses with strong psychological resilience chose to end their lives after trying to escape in vain.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stated emphatically:
 

 
"Practitioners should speak less falsehoods. What Shao Xuanzheng said is true; there’s a hollow section in the stone wall behind Mu Yingchen. If she pries open the sword hilt and strikes the hidden talisman against the hollow stone wall, a secret passage will be revealed. He indeed left her a way out, confident that given her condition, she wouldn’t survive outside for more than seven days and would ultimately die from the curse. Moreover, he believes that without solving the riddle, Mu Yingchen would attempt to use the sword to end her life after several tries."
 

 
The set designer continued to passionately complain, "Who would even notice that the stone wall is hollow? Are we supposed to smash our heads against it?"
 

 
"Others can't," Shi Qianqiu firmly believed in his choice of leading actress. "Tong Zhao can."
 

 
Meanwhile, the assistant director monitoring Shao Xuanzheng slowly raised a hand, saying, "Um, I don't know why, but when we officially started filming, Shao Xuanzheng hesitated for a long time and didn’t put the talisman in the sword hilt. He almost directly killed her with the sword instead.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "..."
 

 
All the staff: "..."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I believe in Tong Zhao; she will definitely find a solution in a desperate situation!"
 

 
Everyone looked at him.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "At worst, we can restart again. I have the money."
 

 
Hearing this, everyone felt relieved.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's self-persuasion tactics were very effective.
 

 
People's thoughts are inherently fleeting. Tong Zhao threatened his status as the leading man, and his wariness of her was deeply rooted in his subconscious, causing his character to be more cautious of Mu Yingchen. He would rather risk damaging his own path than allow her to rise.
 

 
...
 

 
In reality, Chen Zhuzhi was overthinking.
 

 
Even if the talisman were really hidden in the sword's hilt, Tong Zhao wouldn't think of it.
 

 
Because of her cultivation, particularly in swordsmanship, Lu Xianzhang was the most straightforward and simple-minded among all her personalities, except for Xiao Zhao (the five-year-old version of Tong Zhao at that time). Any extraneous thoughts would only interfere with her sword intent. She believed that "not cultivating a saintly heart leads to true virtue; if one seeks to become a saint, they invite all kinds of evils." Before crossing into that body, the original host often questioned why her husband betrayed her, why he chose immortality over family—
 

 
"Oh, great heaven, why have you treated me so?"
 

 
Later, that husband knelt before Lu Xianzhang, begging for her mercy, but she didn't ask further.
 

 
In short, Lu Xianzhang was not good at solving puzzles.
 

 
Under the tense gaze of the staff, she reached for the mundane sword, weakly swung it a couple of times, and her face showed visible disdain: "Forget it, I’ll just make do with this..."
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite decisive; she opted for self-destruction faster than others.
 

 
When she raised the sword towards herself, Deputy Director Zeng signaled to the logistics team that they could prepare for a restart.
 

 
"Are the instruments all set?”
 

 
“Holy crap!”
 

 
“Deputy Director, look quick!”
 

 
“That's brutal!”
 

 
Just as Deputy Director Zeng turned around, a series of sharp intakes of breath echoed from behind him.
 

 
He turned back, stunned.
 

 
Tong Zhao had directly chopped off her locked left hand, the pristine white hand falling into the water, creating a splash of crimson blossoms on the surface.
 

 
Then she raised her stump of a left hand, coldly glaring as she dipped her right fingers into the spurting blood. She lifted her right hand high, using her own blood to draw an explosive rune on the chains, and with the little remaining spiritual power she had, she shattered the iron chains.
 

 
After the golden core was destroyed, Tong Zhao had almost no spiritual energy left.
 

 
Only a small portion of her blood remained circulating in her body, close to an artery, scientifically speaking. She could have wielded the sword, but the blood on her right hand was insufficient for the spell. This was a limitation imposed by Shi Qianqiu on the actors; otherwise, they could use their spiritual power freely, and the water prison would never hold her.
 

 
This was precisely why the male lead was confident she wouldn’t escape.
 

 
Who knew someone could be so ruthless to themselves?
 

 
Next, she plunged into the icy water and mimicked her earlier actions to shatter the chains on her legs.
 

 
With her freedom restored and one hand still functioning, she had more options for escaping.
 

 
The staff exchanged confused glances and murmured:
 

 
“The female lead lost her left hand? Just like that?”
 

 
“That’s brutal! How could she do that? She hasn’t even activated the pain exemption!”
 

 
“What did you expect? A woman who can extract bullets with tweezers is not an ordinary person.”
 

 
Outside the water prison, a tall, mute, illiterate guard was stationed to prevent him from seeing anything he shouldn’t. Tong Zhao used her sword to take down this first little person, snatched his waist pouch, and placed her severed hand inside, deciding to escape from the Shao estate first.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng was moved: “Finally, we have a female lead who can successfully escape the water prison!”
 

 
"Brother Shi's challenges are really set against people."
 

 
"That's not fair," Shi Qianqiu defended himself. "Out of humanitarianism, I arranged the plot to start when the supporting character, Li Qiaoqiao, visits the Shao estate. To welcome the distinguished guest, Shao Xuanzheng made all the preparations, even hiring a theater troupe and acrobats from the common folk. That was when the guards were at their weakest..."
 

 
"Very humane."
 

 
"Even that old rascal Miyazaki would want to give you a pat on the back."
 

 
"Can't say it's hellish difficulty, just that it's impassable."
 

 
When Tong Zhao was leaving the Shao estate, she heard about today's big event.
 

 
It was said that Shao Xianzhang's partner had run away with a man practicing the demonic path, leaving behind a letter asking him not to pursue her, severing all ties.
 

 
Recently, Shao Xianzhang had been exchanging letters with Li Qiaoqiao, his childhood sweetheart, inviting her to visit, which showed he had moved on from his heartbreak.
 

 
However, it was said that Miss Li suffered from a heart ailment, and despite spending a lot of spiritual medicine, it had not improved.
 

 
Although her cultivation was not poor, Miss Li was fated to have a short life; her fate was truly unfortunate.
 

 
Though not his destined partner, Miss Li also came from a prestigious sect, making them a good match. Her temperament was much gentler than Mu Yingchen's... Moreover, with Shao Xianzhang's current level of cultivation, he didn’t need to force himself to engage in dual cultivation with someone who was his destined match to improve his skills. The rough-speaking servant chuckled, saying it was good that the woman had left, as it cleared the way for Miss Li.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled.
 

 
Indeed, not only did it clear the way for a newcomer, but she would also use her life force to extend hers.
# Chapter54
The small commotion in the water prison did not catch Shao Xuanzheng's attention.
 

 
He was fully immersed in the joy of Lady Li agreeing to visit his estate, supervising the servants who were rushing to make everything perfect. His "missing" and "suspected to have run off with a lover" partner, Mu Yingchen, had a solitary and proud personality, preferring a simple lifestyle. Initially, he didn't mind and even agreed with her belief that cultivators should not be extravagant. However, after spending time together...
 

 
It became a bit tedious.
 

 
Moreover, this simple decor often reminded Shao Xuanzheng that Mu Yingchen, despite her great talent, was of humble origins, making them incompatible.
 

 
On the other hand, Sister Li had been raised in luxury as a noble lady, enjoying lavish and ornate items. He wanted to create a good impression, to prevent her from thinking that marrying into the Shao family would mean hardship and drudgery.
 

 
But the Shao estate was just too vast.
 

 
For instance, the gardens still maintained a simple aesthetic, with small bridges and flowing water.
 

 
He instructed, "If Lady Li asks, just say it's all Mu Xianzhang's preferences. I want to leave a corner of the estate as her place until there’s a new mistress."
 

 
The servants repeatedly agreed.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng liked obedient workers who wouldn't question his decisions, preferring those who were simply devoted to him.
 

 
In the monitoring room backstage:
 

 
"Okay, this statement not only enriches his romantic persona but also implies that as long as the other party becomes his new partner, there won’t be any traces of other women in the estate... This kind of line is not something an average scumbag could say! He’s the particularly despicable type."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu praised vigorously.
 

 
Others exchanged subtle glances towards the head director.
 

 
The set designer remarked, "Brother Shi's praise really isn't something just anyone can handle."
 

 
Due to Chen Zhuzhi's history with an abusive girlfriend, his reputation within the group was not high.
 

 
Especially among the female staff, even with his charming and enthusiastic face, they still avoided him.
 

 
To win back his girlfriend's forgiveness, Chen Zhuzhi paid a hefty compensation. Besides a fixed amount, he also had to give 50% of all his earnings over the next three years to her. "The Heartless Tribulation" had been delayed for a long time, and Chen Zhuzhi wished it could be postponed even longer to avoid paying.
 

 
Unfortunately, Tong Zhao's arrival was poorly timed.
 

 
He had privately asked Shi Qianqiu if he could delay the shoot by two months. Shi Qianqiu's response was, "Your thinking is a rare breed of super scumbag, truly eye-opening. There really is no bottom to cheapness; choosing you to play Shao Xuanzheng was a wise decision. Stop dreaming—there’s no chance. If you bother me again during filming, I have that girl's WeChat. If she complains that you're harassing her or not paying her properly, you'll have to deal with my little brother from now on."
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi fell silent immediately and never brought up the idea of trying to dodge payments again.
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu mentioned "little brother," he meant his real younger brother.
 

 
All the gray businesses were managed by his brother, and the industry joked that if Shi Qianqiu's scripts failed, he'd have to go home to collect protection money.
 

 
Characters like Shao Xuanzheng, who can be ruthless to their wives and daughters, are rare in the industry.
 

 
Typically, filmmakers take shortcuts, starting the story after the wives and daughters have been killed.
 

 
They implant memories directly, eliminating the need for actors to perform these scenes, and professional psychological treatment follows, leaving little issue behind.
 

 
Some actors even expressed that filming instinctive movies deepened their understanding of humanity's darkness. They used to have impulsive thoughts during anger but no longer did after completing violent scenes, hoping to remind the audience of the importance of emotional management.
 

 
While Shao Xuanzheng was joyfully preparing to welcome his beauty, Tong Zhao was making her way down the mountain.
 

 
She couldn't take the main road.
 

 
The tip of the sword dripped with blood, and the soaked robe felt bone-chillingly cold in the wind. She had no spiritual energy to fend off the chill, so she silently endured it.
 

 
In the monitoring room, her comfort level dropped to nearly zero.
 

 
Yet her face remained expressionless.
 

 
This aligned perfectly with Mu Yingchen's character design.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was cold on the outside but passionate on the inside, embodying an uncompromising stubbornness, solitary and proud.
 

 
This sense of aloofness meant that when she was harmed by those closest to her and when Shao Xuanzheng twisted the truth, no one questioned the reality or cared about her safety.

Deputy Director Zeng exclaimed in surprise, "No wonder she can excel in post-apocalyptic films; being in the mud doesn’t dull her sharpness at all. Shi Qianqiu has a great eye for talent."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied, "It's her strong subconscious."
 

 
The woman on screen wore simple clothes; her once pristine robe now looked like tattered rags. Her wounds, casually bandaged with strips of cloth, still oozed blood, but her face remained pale and flawless. Her striking brows and eyes lacked expression yet conveyed emotion, avoiding a sense of emptiness.
 

 
Even when fate was harsh and the road ahead was perilous, her will remained unshaken.
 

 
The set designer sighed, "It's hard to imagine what she’s been through in reality to develop such a strong subconscious. Is Shi Qianqiu close to her? I noticed she rarely mentions her personal life in interviews."
 

 
"Not close. I’m not interested in the actors' personal lives," Shi Qianqiu replied with a hint of indifference.
 

 
He was more concerned about how Tong Zhao would perform.
 

 
After the female lead successfully escaped from the water prison, he set up many subplots, including one where she hides in the estate and waits for the supporting character, Li Qiaoqiao, to confront the scumbag face to face. After the confrontation, Shao Xuanzheng would likely kill her in a fit of rage, which would create a rift between him and Li Qiaoqiao. The story of his mistreatment of his wife would also spread, leading to an imperfect ending for the male lead.
 

 
There was also an option for secretly seeking help from Li Qiaoqiao.
 

 
While other instinctual screenwriters feared that actors might stray off course, Shi Qianqiu was not worried.
 

 
In his films, there were infinite possibilities!
 

 
Think they’ve gone off course?
 

 
In reality, they had simply crossed from route A to route B!
 

 
---
 

 
Crossing into route B, Tong Zhao wanted to wash herself by the stream when she suddenly heard the sound of hoofbeats approaching from the main mountain path.
 

 
Cultivators have keen senses; even with little spiritual energy left, her physique remained strong. She heard the sound of the carriage team approaching from quite a distance, so she hid quietly in the grass to observe. When the convoy came into view, it slowed down and stopped on the main road near the stream. A servant got down first, setting the footstep for a young lady dressed in luxurious attire to alight from the carriage.
 

 
This young lady was Li Qiaoqiao, whom she had met years ago as Madam Shao.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao was slightly younger than her but was no longer an ordinary girl, relying on cultivation and family spirit medicines to maintain her youthful appearance. She also put in considerable effort to preserve her beautiful, youthful face.
 

 
However, there was a stain on her embroidered shoes, which must be why she had gotten down early.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao had come to wash her feet.
 

 
In the holographic projection, Tong Zhao's disheveled state contrasted sharply with Li Qiaoqiao's delicate and glamorous appearance.
 

 
Like in traditional films, the information the audience received from the screen was very objective, highlighting the power dynamics of wealth and beauty. The female lead was on a path of reversal, requiring her to draw out the oppressive points in her early encounters. One potential issue in many films featuring Tong Zhao was pointed out by the assistant director:
 

 
"She’s too beautiful; even wrapped in rags, she has a strong presence."
 

 
Of course, Li Qiaoqiao’s actress, Ding Jiao, was a beauty; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been cast in the role.
 

 
But objectively speaking, Tong Zhao was even more beautiful.
 

 
This beauty diluted the intended contrast of strength and weakness in the character setup.
 

 
"Even though I know that anything can happen in instinct films and Director Shi likes open-ended developments—like if Mu Yingchen dies by the roadside, as long as the plot is exciting, it can still be accepted..." the props assistant said, captivated. "But for some reason, when I see Tong Zhao, I feel like her misfortune is only temporary; she’ll make a comeback any moment."
 

 
As Tong Zhao looked at Li Qiaoqiao, Director Shi zoomed in on her.
 

 
At the same time, capturing her internal monologue.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I know who she is.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [She is the childhood sweetheart that Shao Xuanzheng loves, the moonlight in his heart. I must use my life to exchange for her health.]
 

 
She calmly spoke of her husband falling in love with another woman.
 

 
Her husband and his childhood sweetheart rekindled their old flame and wanted to kill her, using her life to cure his beloved's ailment.
 

 
This contradiction would infuriate anyone, not just the parties involved.
 

 
Even the onlookers listening would feel a surge of anger.
 

 
But Tong Zhao's portrayal of Mu Yingchen was that of a cultivator whose spiritual realm was higher than that of the male lead.
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu wrote this character setup, the entire crew said his standards were too high and that he didn’t understand women at all. No woman could remain calm in the face of such things—putting aside gender stereotypes, even a man would feel anxious if he was cheated on; upon seeing the lover, he might not rush to confront them, but internally he would be seething.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was aloof and proud, not a pushover.
 

 
She shouldn't just remain silent or swallow her anger.
 

 
It was overly idealistic, like writing a novel.
 

 
At the time, Assistant Director Zeng risked doubling his debts to complain, "You’re not looking for a leading lady; you’re searching for a transcendent being!"
 

 
But unexpectedly, he found this ethereal subconscious quality.
 

 
Zeng seized the opportunity to give Li Qiaoqiao’s elegant attire several close-ups, emphasizing her noble background and carefree smile, highlighting how well she was currently living.
 

 
The Li family's entourage also played along, with Extra A following the scripted lines: "Actually, it's not too late to clean up once we arrive at the manor. Given how much Shao Xuanzheng values you, even if you arrive in a carriage, he wouldn't blame you at all."
 

 
"Ridiculous," Li Qiaoqiao laughed, her words devoid of any reproach, filled instead with excitement and joy. "Brother Shao is good to me; I can’t be impolite. He once wrote to me, saying that Mu Yingchen often offends others with her odd behavior and disregard for etiquette, which is why she never gets invited to gatherings.”
 

 
In the end, Li Qiaoqiao's voice lowered: "Mu Yingchen left without a word, and brother Shao is already very sad. I can't let him down again."
 

 
Tong Zhao's actions aligned with her cold thoughts:
 

 
【I'll wait to wash myself until they're gone.】
 

 
She managed to completely refrain from evaluating Li Qiaoqiao!
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng, who was obsessed with gambling and considered himself quite ordinary, could not imagine such a transcendent subconscious in the entertainment industry; it was simply abnormal.
 

 
Skeptical, he secretly increased the sensitivity of his detection on Tong Zhao's thoughts.
 

 
Even if he picked up some useless excess content, he could delete it in post-production; it wouldn't matter.
 

 
Unlike the orderly expression found in literary works, human thought is often chaotic and disjointed. If not filtered through AI, it could easily record things like, "Dogs like to eat feces; they are very affectionate animals. Do people seem like feces in a dog's eyes?" or, "This mountain, this water..." along with recently popular songs playing on repeat.
 

 
However, even after increasing the sensitivity, Tong Zhao's thoughts remained quiet and sparse.
 

 
Occasional phrases were delivered in a cold, deep tone, like a sword tempered and then treated in deep freeze.
 

 
After a brief rest, the Li family’s convoy resumed its journey.
 

 
Once the carriage had completely moved away, Tong Zhao went upstream to the small creek to wash off the dirt and her wounds. Without a change of clothes, she hesitated for a moment about whether to remove her tattered robe.
 

 
She considered going without clothes.
 

 
After all, she didn't mind.
 

 
...
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
"We can't just let it be, sister!"
 

 
"Can we airdrop some clean clothes for her? Come on, brother Shi, be a decent person! It's reasonable to have a clean outfit in a fantasy setting like this forest, right? I can write the code for you right now!" One of the female prop assistants, a fan of Tong Zhao, was already feeling empathetic, and now her motherly instincts were overflowing.
 

 
Fortunately, what everyone worried about didn’t happen.
 

 
Tong Zhao ultimately chose to make do with the robe she had on.
 

 
"Don't worry, if you go a little further, you'll encounter a hunter's cabin. Her path is right, and even if it’s not, I’ll adjust it to be so. There will be clean clothes inside."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu reassured the prop assistant.
 

 
Since no female actor had ever successfully escaped from the water prison before, some crew members unfamiliar with the core script were unaware of the subsequent plot.
 

 
"Is there anything else?"
 

 
The prop assistant sniffled.
 

 
She was trying hard to recall if she had written any useful prop codes.
 

 
"Of course there is."
 

 
The prop assistant's eyes lit up, while Assistant Director Zeng averted his gaze, unable to bear it.
 

 
"Inside, there’s a little girl who wants to visit Shao's residence to learn, but she encounters a hunter uncle who can't cultivate due to his poor spiritual roots. Jealous of her talent, he locks her up to produce offspring with her, hoping to have descendants with her cultivation gifts. This is the female protagonist's first mini-boss battle."
 

 
"…"
 

 
The prop assistant exclaimed, "What I meant by 'anything else' was hot food and healing medicine."
 

 
Not a mini-boss that would worsen the beautiful lady's injuries!
 

 
“Why arrange such dark and cruel plot points...?”
 

 
One of the staff posed a soul-searching question.
 

 
“This is a motivational turning point for the female protagonist; it’s not dark or cruel at all, but full of positive energy,” the mastermind explained to the subordinates. “When the male and female leads first meet, Shao Xuanzheng comes from a prestigious background, far superior to Mu Yingchen's, so she tends to believe what he says and views him as better than herself.”
 

 
“And then?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu smiled, “You’ll find out soon enough.”
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao's destination was the mortal market at the foot of the mountain.
 

 
Though she had no silver coins, thankfully, Shao Xuanzheng hadn’t taken everything she had on her. The jade pendant at her waist should fetch some money. Being from a prestigious lineage, Shao Xuanzheng had little experience dealing with mortals; when he needed something, he had servants do it for him and was mostly ignorant of worldly matters.
 

 
Before embarking on her cultivation journey, Mu Yingchen was just an ordinary child.
 

 
According to Shi Qianqiu's setup, she had stood out at the age of seven during the decade-long recruitment of disciples by the North Qing sect. After becoming a disciple, she fortuitously met Shao Xuanzheng, who was searching for his destined partner, and they became a couple through his ardent pursuit...
 

 
In any case, Tong Zhao naturally recalled her knowledge about the mortal market.
 

 
The hunter's cabin was right along the path leading her down the mountain.
 

 
When Tong Zhao spotted the hunter's cabin, she indeed walked over.
 

 
After all, her dirty robe was too conspicuous; changing into a simple coarse cloth garment would be much better.
 

 
The backstage staff, witnessing this scene, were all deeply moved—
 

 
“The plot is back on track!”
 

 
"I'm feeling so secure for the first time in brother Shi's movie."
 

 
"Thanks to Tong Zhao; she truly is the savior of our crew."
 

 
"To be honest, her note in my WeChat contacts is 'Savior,' haha..."
 

 
With the plot progressing well, everyone felt reassured.
 

 
In the monitoring footage, Tong Zhao pushed open the wooden door and asked, "Is anyone in there?"
 

 
No response.
 

 
All she heard was the sound of something kicking against the wooden boards deep inside the room.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Could they be keeping hunting dogs in the bedroom?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [But I don't hear any barking.]
 

 
The cabin was indeed very small, containing only a bedroom and various hunting trophies and bows.
 

 
The owner of the house seemed to have gone hunting.
 

 
Given that a professional dealing with fierce beasts should have medical supplies, Tong Zhao decided to search for any medicine and clean clothes inside, placing the jade pendant in a visible spot for the owner to exchange for money.
 

 
As if sensing that Tong Zhao didn't intend to leave and was wandering around the cabin, the sound of kicking from the bedroom intensified. Confused by the strange noise, she said, "Sorry for intruding," unlocked the door, and pushed it open—
 

 
Inside was a young woman whose hands and feet were bound with ropes and her mouth stuffed with cloth.
 

 
Upon seeing Tong Zhao, she widened her eyes in shock.
 

 
"……"
 

 
Tong Zhao truly did not expect this turn of events.
 

 
Having been in seclusion at Shao's Manor, she had distanced herself from worldly troubles for quite a while.
 

 
She only intended to borrow some clothing and medical supplies.
 

 
Crouching down, she used her sword to cut the ropes binding the young woman.
 

 
Once her hands were free and she removed the cloth from her mouth, the woman stared blankly for a moment before grabbing Tong Zhao's hand as if in a daze: "Who are you? You need to leave quickly. He will definitely come back before dark, and when he does, you'll suffer just like I have... Please, hurry..."
 

 
As she spoke, her gaze fell on the sword in Tong Zhao's hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought the woman wanted her to kill the villain to save her from her torment.
 

 
Indeed, hope shone in the woman's eyes.
 

 
But her plea was not what Tong Zhao had imagined.
 

 
The woman asked, "Before you go, could you kill me?"
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao was even more confused.
 

 
In this scene, the woman exuded a dignified beauty, lacking the seductive charm often seen in "Sea King's Kill," making her appear honest and reliable. From the beginning, even while trapped in the water prison, her expressions had been resolute, but now she showed signs of confusion.
 

 
The props assistant remarked, "Aww, that’s kind of cute."
 

 
Beyond the fangirl filter, others nodded in agreement: "That's the charm of a contrast, right?"
 

 
"Why would I want to kill you? Explain yourself, and then I’ll leave."
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn't particularly afraid of the cabin's owner.
 

 
After failing to convince her, the woman glanced out the window at the sky, estimating that there was still some time before sunset, and quickly began to explain her situation. In a hushed voice, she said, "Are you a passing traveler? I don’t want to live anymore. My parents think I went up the mountain to find a master, and that I wouldn’t come back. They probably believe their daughter forgot home after receiving guidance from an immortal. They haven’t even sent my younger brother to Shao's Manor to check if I’m really there."
 

 
If someone asked about her disappearance...
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng, being prideful, might just investigate it.
 

 
"Forget it, there's no point in asking; it would be embarrassing," the woman shook her head sadly. "I've lost my virtue and can neither go back to get married nor am I at the right age to become a disciple. That man, with the surname He, wants me to bear him a son with a water spirit root, which I absolutely refuse. He fears I'll die, so every time he goes hunting, he locks my hands and feet and stuffs my mouth. I can't even bite my tongue to end it. Dying would be better, so I wouldn't have to suffer his humiliation anymore!"
 

 
The more she spoke, the more she felt that seeking death was a good idea.
 

 
The woman grabbed Tong Zhao's right arm, pleading with her once more to end her life.
 

 
Tong Zhao remained calm and asked, "Do you want to become a disciple of Shao Xuanzheng?"
 

 
She noticed that the woman's potential was quite good. Although she hadn't received proper guidance or training, her eyes were the windows to her soul, and with their physical contact, Tong Zhao could tell that the woman was a remarkable candidate with a water spirit root. It was such a pity; over the years, countless people had wanted to become Shao Xuanzheng's disciple, yet few compared to the woman before her.
 

 
Hearing her question, the woman was momentarily taken aback and shook her head.
 

 
When it came to the topic of seeking immortality and cultivation, a flicker of life returned to her previously numb expression: "No, I admire another immortal."
 

 
Mentioning the immortal she admired, her tone became somewhat shy: "When I was just a child, I had the fortune to see Mu Xianzhang from a distance at the disciple ceremony. She had an ethereal grace, as pure as snow. Although I couldn't see her face clearly from so far away, I truly thought..."
 

 
"An immortal descending from the heavens to save all beings from suffering must be just like her.”
 

 
The woman's mental state was not healthy; after falling into memories, she appeared dazed for a while, her dirty and bruised face reflecting a dreamy longing and sense of loss.
 

 
She had been locked up in the hunter's cabin for quite some time.
 

 
Unbeknownst to her, the Mu Xianzhang from the disciple ceremony had been rumored to have abandoned her husband and "left" Shao's Manor.
 

 
"To save all beings..."
 

 
Tong Zhao introspected and objectively shattered the woman's false fantasies: "You have misunderstood her a bit. She isn’t the type to meddle in others' affairs. Forget about saving all beings; if you were to die in front of her while she was focused on her cultivation, she likely wouldn’t even save you."
 

 
"Do you know her? You don’t know her, so how can you say that? You’re judging an immortal with a mortal’s heart! If she were here, she would definitely save me!”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao deny her idol, the woman's tone became agitated.
 

 
This agitation brought some life back to her lifeless expression.
 

 
Just then, heavy footsteps accompanied by grumbling approached from nearby.
 

 
"Didn't get anything, what a bad day."
 

 
The hunter pushed open the door: "Wife, your man is back!"
 

 
The woman froze as if she had heard a cat’s call.
 

 
Tong Zhao gripped the broken sword with one hand, reluctantly admitting:
 

 
"Alright, maybe you’re right.”
# Chapter55
When the door was pushed open, the entire room was shrouded in darkness, blocked by the tall figure standing in the doorway.
 

 
The actor playing the hunter was actually an underground boxer in real life. Due to his robust build, he often made cameo appearances in instinct films to earn some extra cash. He was nearly two meters tall, and with his muscular upper body, director Shi Qianqiu still felt it wasn't enough, so he had the modeling team increase various metrics within the actor's acceptable limits—
 

 
While a person who was 1.5 meters tall might feel awkward in a body that was two meters tall, the difference between 1.8 and 1.9 meters wasn’t as jarring. This was referred to as artistic processing in instinct films, and professionals assessed how much and in what ways these adjustments could be made.
 

 
In short, the hunter standing before the two female characters looked like a massive mountain of muscle.
 

 
He exuded a strong sense of pressure, like a game boss.
 

 
Compared to this imposing figure, Tong Zhao, kneeling on one knee and facing him, looked so thin that she seemed like she could be blown away by the wind. This stark contrast provided a powerful visual shock to the audience.
 

 
"Who are you? How did you get into my home?"
 

 
The hunter frowned, his facial flesh bunching together.
 

 
He then noticed the ropes that had been untied beside his woman and, rather than feeling guilty about being discovered, became enraged: “You untied my wife! If she escapes, what will you give me in compensation?”
 

 
Saying this, he stepped forward to grab the woman.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao stood up and blocked his path.
 

 
Before she could speak, the woman grasped Tong Zhao’s calf and pleaded with the hunter, “She was just passing through. I didn’t intend to escape; please let her go. She came from Shao’s Manor, and if she goes missing for no reason, the immortal will definitely send someone to look for her. That wouldn’t be good for either of us.”
 

 
Although Tong Zhao had a sword, the disparity in their sizes was too great.
 

 
The woman had suffered at the hands of the hunter before.
 

 
His hand, large like a fan, struck her face, leaving her head ringing. To this day, her right ear still didn’t hear properly.
 

 
Tong Zhao was taken aback and turned to ask, “How do you know I came from Shao’s Manor?”
 

 
The woman was momentarily stunned as well.
 

 
She actually didn’t know Tong Zhao’s background; she had just made it up on the spot, hoping to invoke the fear of the immortal at the mountain’s peak to spare this girl’s life. She was already in a miserable situation; there was no need to drag someone else into it.
 

 
Hearing “Shao’s Manor,” hesitation appeared on the hunter's previously stormy face.
 

 
He wouldn’t dare touch anyone from the manor; he had to bow and scrape if he encountered them on the mountain road.
 

 
But if he let Tong Zhao go, he was afraid his abduction of women would be exposed.
 

 
After a moment, he pressed his voice low and stated emphatically, “This is my wife. I tied her up because we had some disagreements last night, and I didn’t want her running back to her family to complain. This place is small, so I won't be keeping guests.”
 

 
Since it was a marital conflict, he figured this poorly dressed woman wouldn’t cause any trouble.
 

 
The hunter issued his eviction order, glaring at the woman with a menacing look, warning her not to say too much.
 

 
Not wanting to implicate her, the woman shed tears while trying to urge her to leave.
 

 
But Tong Zhao seemed to ignore it all.
 

 
She raised her gaze, her eyes shining with a cold light that made the hunter's heart skip a beat. Ignoring her tattered clothing, he believed the woman's words; this was clearly a person of high status from Shao’s Manor, given her extraordinary demeanor. Her captivating eyes adorned her beautiful face, rendering even him, who loved beauty, unable to harbor any ill intentions toward her.
 

 
“She is not your wife,” Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Both their faces changed.
 

 
The hunter narrowed his eyes. “Nonsense! I’ve claimed this woman’s body; how can she not be my wife? Ask her; let her say it herself if she’s not mine!”
 

 
The woman’s face turned pale.
 

 
She hated him to the core and was reluctant to admit it.
 

 
But to protect Tong Zhao’s life, she bit her tongue, about to swallow her humiliation and confess. Just then, Tong Zhao spoke slowly again:
 

 
“She is my disciple.”
 

 
As soon as the words left her lips, the sword followed, its cold glint arriving first.
 

 
This ordinary sword was truly terrible; it was the worst sword Tong Zhao had ever used, lacking any spiritual energy to enhance it, relying solely on her swordsmanship. The hunter reacted quickly, shifting so that the sword struck his shoulder instead of a vital spot. He let out a howl, and the wound exposed the white of his bones.
 

 
“Damn woman, I don’t care where you came from; I’ll make you die here!”
 

 
He grabbed his hunting knife, moving quickly, but the injured woman reacted even faster.
 

 
So fast that the staff thought the backstage had given her some kind of cheat.
 

 
…
 

 
The prop master shook her head. “I’m not involved; this isn’t my concern.”
 

 
“The protagonist’s fighting ability is already quite high, but there’s also the subconscious influence of the actor,” Shi Qianqiu said, well aware of how actors and their character templates affect each other, knowing that much of this was Tong Zhao’s own skill.
 

 
“And it looks particularly good,” the modeler noted. “In the past, when we implanted swordsmanship data into other actors, they couldn’t match Tong Zhao’s performance. Does she have a martial arts background?”
 

 
Yes, it looked good.
 

 
Tong Zhao, with her golden core shattered and spiritual energy depleted, was no different from an ordinary person, relying on her wits.
 

 
In the cramped room, she managed to avoid being touched by the hunter.
 

 
Though skilled in archery and adept at fighting beasts, the hunter lacked experience in combat with people.
 

 
The more colors hanging from her, the more anxious he became.
 

 
Damn it, why can’t he touch her!
 

 
The 360-degree camera captured every angle, giving the post-production team plenty of opportunities to shine. Everyone was eagerly anticipating the polished final version—yet even now, Tong Zhao’s fight scenes were overly spectacular, leaving the staff holding their breath and wishing for more time to watch them fight!
 

 
The last time they felt this way was during the final dance after Concubine Chen poisoned herself.
 

 
Even though the film was still being shot, everyone felt it would become an iconic scene once aired.
 

 
This was the kind of memorable moment many actors dream of; just appearing once could fuel marketing for a long time.
 

 
Who would have thought Tong Zhao would have one in every film?
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," Feng Yanqi using tweezers to extract a bullet from her thigh became another iconic moment widely discussed on Bilibili and Douyin, needing little marketing, as the visuals were too shocking and captivating.
 

 
“I want to marry my sister who can both dance and fight! Wuwuwu!”
 

 
The props girl couldn’t contain her fangirl feelings, cupping her face in admiration.
 

 
The actor playing the hunter had previously filmed fight scenes filled with brute force, wielding a hunting knife with an imposing presence that heightened the tension. In contrast, Tong Zhao moved with calm confidence, each sword stroke seeming like a dance on the edge of a blade. Every flash of cold light sent the burly man reeling, splattering bright red blood that made eyes sting.
 

 
Ultimately, she gracefully evaded a fatal blow, twisting her wrist to deliver a precise stab, driving the sword straight into the hunter's heart.
 

 
As the long sword was pulled from the giant's chest, he collapsed with a thud.
 

 
Blood splattered across the entire back wall of the bedroom, but despite the gruesome scene, there was no joy or sorrow in her eyes. There was no exhilaration from dispatching a villain, nor relief from narrowly escaping danger.
 

 
The blood on the ordinary sword was still warm, yet she felt colder than the blade itself.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook the blood from her sword and looked at the girl who had curled up in the corner since the fight began. “What’s your name?”
 

 
“...I-I’m Qing Niang.”
 

 
Called out, Qing Niang shivered.
 

 
“Let’s go. I’ll take you home.”
 

 
...
 

 
Qing Niang kindly applied medicine to her wounds and fetched well water for her to wash her face and body. Tong Zhao found clean clothes to change into; even the coarse linen couldn't hide her stunning beauty.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao, Qing Niang couldn’t help but feel a sense of shame. She lowered her eyelids shyly and said, “Are you the immortal from Shao’s Village? I don’t want to go home. You saved me, and I don’t dare to ask for anything else—only that you accept me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was silent for a moment. “I’m not interested in women.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
“I mean as a servant.”
 

 
“I don’t need anyone to serve me.”
 

 
If she could recover her spiritual power, she could easily conjure a servant with a spell. If she couldn’t recover, and couldn’t defeat Shao Xuanzheng, she would die in seven days—what use would a servant be then? To collect her body? Not necessary.
 

 
Thinking that she was unwanted, Qing Niang’s eyes reddened.
 

 
Before she could cry, Tong Zhao reached out and patted her head. “Didn’t you say you wanted to apprentice under Mu Yingchen? Do you want to be my disciple or a servant? Think it through.”
 

 
Realizing what that meant, Qing Niang was stunned.
 

 
“Y-You are Mu Yingchen!?”
 

 
Tong Zhao affirmed with a sound.
 

 
To Qing Niang, her snow-white profile was as beautiful as something from a poem or painting. She never imagined that the person she admired was standing before her! In her eyes, Mu Yingchen was like a figure from mythology—someone to be gazed at from afar, not to be approached, let alone spoken to, much less to be accepted as a disciple.
 

 
“What’s wrong?” Tong Zhao smirked. “Am I disappointing you by being so down on my luck?”
 

 
Her previous sword was a treasured gift from her master, with a white scabbard adorned with luminous pearls. Now, she needed to use techniques even to kill a mortal, which was embarrassing.
 

 
Qing Niang shook her head vigorously, insisting she wasn’t disappointed.
 

 
Tong Zhao briefly recounted her experiences, prompting tears from Qing Niang as she angrily cursed Shao Xuanzheng, calling him worse than a beast.
 

 
“I don’t have long to live, but you have good potential. Teaching you some protective spells should be enough.”
 

 
Tong Zhao had considered seeking help from the immortal sect. But Shao Xuanzheng wasn’t a fool; he knew she had no friends. The only one who might care for her was her former sect, and he could easily ambush her on the way there. Besides, her master had ascended, and with their departure, the connections had grown cold. She struggled to navigate the complexities of human relationships.
 

 
“If you don’t want to go home, then come with me to find the Sword of Severing Emotion.”
 

 
Tong Zhao explained what the Sword of Severing Emotion was.
 

 
In the worldview of "Heartless Tribulation," each sword cultivator had a different path, leading to varied approaches in sword refining. Since she had cultivated alongside Shao Xuanzheng for years, her original goal was to master the Longqing Sword. The sword he wielded was a Longqing Sword nearing the Golden Core stage, similar to many enchanted weapons in games.
 

 
Tong Zhao had once possessed a similar sword, but he had broken it along with her Golden Core.
 

 
Every sword has its lineage.
 

 
All sword cultivators aimed to refine their swords to resemble legendary divine blades or to uncover the sword that lay within their inner demons. However, the latter was akin to a legend of the martial world, and no one had ever found it.
 

 
— Sword cultivators who break through to the Golden Core stage can enter the Valley of Ten Thousand Swords during meditation. Within it, they can cultivate and embark on trials to seek historically significant swords. At this point, a sudden sharp pain struck Tong Zhao's head, and she furrowed her brow, pressing against her temples: “There’s something very important… but I can’t remember.”
 

 
“I don’t have time to cultivate again; I can only seek out the sword that is inherently stronger than I am.”
 

 
Qing Niang asked, “This divine sword is so mysterious; where do we even start looking?”
 

 
“I know where it is,” Tong Zhao said with a wry smile, “because the original owner of the Sword of Severing Emotion is my master.”
 

 
“After severing her emotions and ascending, my master hid the sword in a secret place, knowing that I would need it someday. Sword cultivators rarely use others’ swords, so borrowing swords is not a common practice; I didn’t expect my master to foresee this.”
 

 
…
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
Everyone turned to Shi Qianqiu in disbelief: “Director Shi, you actually arranged a golden finger for the female lead? That’s not like you at all!”
 

 
“I’m a conscientious writer; every character is my cherished creation.”
 

 
His statement was met with a chorus of playful boos from backstage.
 

 
Meanwhile, in the male lead’s perspective, managed by Deputy Director Zeng, Shao Xuanzheng had won Li Qiaoqiao’s heart, and they were set to hold a couple’s ceremony soon, celebrating his impending Golden Core breakthrough. Previously, the female lead’s cultivation had outpaced his, which had always been a sore point for him. Now, with her Dan destroyed and sword broken, he was finally about to catch up to her former pace, which felt immensely satisfying.
 

 
…
 

 
As Tong Zhao and her disciple set out together, the atmosphere oddly turned warm and heartening.
 

 
Qing Niang took care of Tong Zhao’s daily needs with nimble hands, while the master, aside from practicing swordplay, was clueless about other chores, often displaying an endearingly “naive” side to onlookers. The master’s pure-hearted nature and indifferent attitude toward past events made Qing Niang feel heartbroken seeing her hand wounds, leading her to sob.
 

 
The master watched her cry for a good while.
 

 
Finally, she sighed and wiped Qing Niang’s tears with her intact right hand: “Stop crying. I’ve never seen a cultivator like you who cries every day.”
 

 
The master no longer needed to eat much, but she would always eat a little of what Qing Niang made because she worried about her going hungry.
 

 
One overflowed with maternal instinct, while the other seemed devoid of it.
 

 
Qing Niang felt that these were the happiest days of her life: she had taken her most admired master as her teacher and discovered that despite Mu Yingchen’s cold demeanor, she had many charming qualities. Qing Niang had half-jokingly and half-jealously asked her fellow disciples about the master, only to learn that she had never taken a disciple before, making this her first time.
 

 
In that moment, Qing Niang thought that even if a celestial being wanted to spend their life with her, it wouldn’t compare to the sweetness of this moment.
 

 
Following the route from memory, the two arrived at the treacherous long cave at the foot of the cliff on the third day. The environment was so dangerous that the props designer kept asking the modeling team if they had no conscience. The modeler replied, “This isn’t our fault; it was Director Shi who requested it to be more perilous and had us redo it three times.”
 

 
Everyone turned to look at the director, who had claimed to be the character’s ‘real mother.’
 

 
Trust him? Not a chance!
 

 
Deep in the cave, they indeed found the treasure box left by the master.
 

 
Inside the box, there was no sword.
 

 
Only a sword sheath and a letter, next to a forge used for sword-making.
 

 
This forge was much larger than those commonly used, and Tong Zhao suspected it had been specially crafted by her master.
 

 
The letter contained her master’s words, stating that each Zhanqing sword was unique and needed to be forged with the flesh and blood of a loved one: “Since Yingchen, you have seen this letter, it means you have made a choice between swordsmanship and love. You are my proudest disciple; neither Shao Xuanzheng's skills nor abilities can match yours. Using him as a sacrifice, you will surely forge your own Zhanqing sword.”
 

 
……
 

 
It seemed her master wanted her to kill her husband to prove her path.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit dazed, realizing her master had overlooked something.
 

 
She had come too late; she intended to use the divine sword for revenge, but what could she use now to sacrifice Shao Xuanzheng?
 

 
As she read the last line, her expression changed drastically. She crumpled the letter and threw it to the ground: “Master, what nonsense!”
 

 
……
 

 
The crew, frustrated, stomped their feet when that last line didn’t get captured on camera.
 

 
“What's written on it, brother Shi?”
 

 
Some were eager for spoilers.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pondered, then smiled with a kind, maternal expression: “A compromise choice.”
 

 
……
 

 
Throughout the journey, the master’s demeanor had always been calm.
 

 
Qing Niang had never seen her angry, and it was rare to catch her smile. Now witnessing her fury and realizing they were in a deadlock, she couldn’t help but feel anxious for her master. She crouched down to pick up the paper, wanting to brainstorm solutions, but Tong Zhao, frustrated and breathless, realized it was too late…
 

 
“If you seek the divine sword only because of harm from the Shao villain, Yingchen has another method. As long as you use a practitioner with water or fire spirit roots as a sacrifice, you can also forge a heartless sword. However, this forge can only be used once; sacrificing a loved one will yield better results, so Yingchen must be cautious.”
 

 
Qing Niang read the last line aloud, understanding why her master was so angry.
 

 
She looked at her master.
 

 
Tong Zhao snatched the letter from her hand and tore it to shreds: “Don’t even think about it; I’ll find another way.”
 

 
Find another way? How?
 

 
There was no time left.
 

 
“Regardless, Qing Niang’s life was saved by the master. If I can be of use and become the master’s sword, I’d be so happy.”
 

 
The hunter valued her water spirit root and beauty, wanting to use her to carry on his lineage. Qing Niang had once fiercely resisted, secretly vowing that if she survived, she would kill the child and take her own life, refusing to let anyone exploit her gifts.
 

 
However, this time she was glad to be a water spirit root, as it meant she could serve as the furnace for her master.
 

 
Qing Niang volunteered to be the furnace, but Tong Zhao firmly refused: "I didn't take you as my disciple to use you as a furnace for sword forging. If you still see me as your master, then this is absolutely not something you should bring up again." This was the first time she had lost her temper so severely with her disciple, giving her a stern lecture.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was about to knock her out to stop the argument, Qing Niang, with red eyes, asked, "So does that mean Master’s revenge will go unpunished? Did she die for nothing?"
 

 
"Revenge can't be paid for with your life. If I die, then it’s just me losing to that scoundrel Shao!"
 

 
The two were caught up in their heated argument, saying whatever came to mind.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished speaking, she paused, as if realizing something. When Qing Niang, daringly, tried to argue with her again, this time Tong Zhao agreed to Qing Niang's suggestion. Qing Niang was overjoyed at the thought of dedicating herself to her master, completely unaware of why her master had changed her mind. She enthusiastically took charge of the preparations for the sword forging, feeling no fear of impending death, and even a little excitement.
 

 
Her disciple still had the chance to become successful.
 

 
Becoming her master's sword meant she could stay by her master's side for a lifetime!
 

 
However, once the sword furnace ignited, Tong Zhao pressed a binding talisman onto Qing Niang's unsuspecting shoulder.
 

 
At that moment, the only part of Qing Niang that could move were her eyes.
 

 
She stared at her master in disbelief, tears streaming down her face.
 

 
"My spiritual power can only hold you with this last talisman, and it won't last long. The box contains the method for forging swords. Once the sword is made, take it and join the North Qing sect. Only seek revenge when you're fully capable; if not, focus on your cultivation and don't dwell on revenge."
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't want Qing Niang to sacrifice herself in vain.
 

 
She thought of a good reason: "The sword I forge must never lose to Shao Xuanzheng again."
 

 
With that, she leaped into the massive sword furnace.
 

 
Qing Niang's eyes widened in horror, and as the binding spell released, she knelt down, crying out for her master.
 

 
She wasn’t afraid of the heat as she clung to the edge of the furnace, her hands burned but still unaware, longing to jump in after her master.
 

 
---
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
"I told you, I'm very good to the female lead! I've arranged tasks for her step by step; there’s no dead end she can’t solve," Shi Qianqiu argued.
 

 
However, the other staff members looked at him with reproachful eyes. "Brother Shi, just wait. After this movie airs, the audience's backlash will fill an entire warehouse with criticism. I advise you to switch careers to selling knives!"
 

 
"I'm not that heartless! You all looking at me like this really hurts!"
 

 
---
 

 
In a moment, Qing Niang, crying by the furnace, suddenly felt a cool breeze.
 

 
She looked up through her tear-filled eyes, thinking she was hallucinating from her sorrow: "No, I can't let my master down; this sword must be forged..." But when she looked into the furnace, she sensed an overwhelming sword intent.
 

 
In the forest on the mountain, the resting birds and animals were startled and fled in fear.
 

 
Dark clouds gathered, and thunder rumbled.
 

 
The woman in white rose amidst the flames, wielding a long sword.
 

 
Dressed in a flowing white robe, the flames did not harm her at all, and her previously broken left hand was now whole.
 

 
Qing Niang knew her master was beautiful, but now, illuminated by the firelight, she saw her master’s face more clearly and felt an almost terrifying beauty, like a drawn blade. While beautiful, it reminded her that a single strike could very well take a life.
 

 
When her master’s gaze fell upon her, she couldn’t help but shiver again.
 

 
It was as if the sword tip pressed against her forehead, exuding an icy chill.
 

 
Her master walked towards her, stepping through the void, and gently patted her head: “I told you not to cry.”
 

 
“Master, you lied to me!”
 

 
Qing Niang felt utterly wronged.
 

 
Tong Zhao bent down to pry her fingers from the edge of the forging furnace, her palms burned and raw: “Fool, don’t you feel pain?”
 

 
"I'm not afraid with you here," Qing Niang said, holding onto her master's hand tightly.
 

 
Tong Zhao's expression remained cold, seemingly unmoved by her display of affection. She used a small spell, and Qing Niang's hand healed at a visible speed: "My spiritual power has returned... No wonder my master said it can only be used once. It fused me with the sword, and my shattered Golden Core has recovered, but now I don’t know if I’m considered human or a sword."
 

 
Qing Niang was happy for her master: "Whether you're human or a sword, you're still my master!"
 

 
Tong Zhao looked down, slightly annoyed: "You're really noisy."
 

 
Qing Niang stopped talking and cautiously looked up while hugging her master's thigh: "So, does Master still want me to go to the North Qing Sect to apprentice?"
 

 
"You can go if you want."
 

 
"I won’t go," Qing Niang shook her head vigorously. "I want to go with you to seek revenge!"
 

 
She glanced at the furnace: "If you’ve become a sword, if I jump in too, can I be your sheath? Or, we could be like Ganjiang and Moye! Better than those scoundrels!"
 

 
While searching for the secret sword, they had heard that the Shao family was holding a couple's ceremony.
 

 
Counting the days, they still had time.
# Chapter56
“What's happening with the male lead?”
 

 
No one knew who asked the question, but it jolted everyone awake.
 

 
The storylines for both sides were running in parallel, and once all scenes were shot, the main and assistant directors would decide what to cut and what to keep. This dual-lead format was somewhat like a variety show, where the more engaging subconscious would have the upper hand.
 

 
“Isn't the assistant director always watching?”
 

 
“Yes,” Assistant Director Zeng replied, “but there’s not much to see.”
 

 
Compared to the female lead, the male lead's storyline was rather lackluster.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was happily welcoming the female supporting character, enjoying food and fun at the fairy estate, creating an ideal picture of what life would be like if she stayed on as the lady of the house.
 

 
The Li family was also quite prestigious, and Li Qiaoqiao had remained unmarried due to being spoiled by her family, so there was no need for her to attach herself to anyone. Thus, Shao Xuanzheng had to show her utmost sincerity and dare not be the least bit negligent.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng and Li Qiaoqiao reminisced about the early days of their acquaintance.
 

 
Back then, Shao Xuanzheng had average talent and didn’t dare to pursue the daughter of the Li family, also wary of her heart condition. However, over the years, their dual cultivation had significantly improved his skills, and he had gained attention from his own family, allowing him to flourish in all aspects.
 

 
After Liu Bang became emperor and Han Chengwang returned to see his first love, the position of a first love in a man's heart was special.
 

 
Ascending to power, becoming wealthy, and changing wives—his new partner was the childhood sweetheart he had longed for.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt it was all worth it.
 

 
If they didn't look at the scenes with the female lead, Tong Zhao, and only focused on Shao Xuanzheng's shots, most of the male crew could feel a sense of exhilaration, even if they didn’t dare to say it outright; there was still some secret enjoyment.
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng sighed, “Chen Zhuzhi, despite his other flaws, truly excels in portraying the role of a toxic husband who finally gets his way.”
 

 
Everyone’s gaze slowly turned towards Assistant Director Zeng, then to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
The tone of praise was becoming increasingly similar.
 

 
The props assistant whispered, “But I still think the female lead’s perspective is more exciting.”
 

 
“Of course,” Shi Qianqiu nodded in agreement. “The comeback from adversity is one of the points the audience loves; for the actors, danger represents an opportunity to shine. I set up so many obstacles precisely to enhance her dramatic moments.”
 

 
Everyone then exchanged glances, questioning, “So it turns out you don’t enjoy making things difficult for the protagonist?”
 

 
In any case, Tong Zhao had endured the challenges set by the heartless director and arrived at a critical turning point.
 

 
---
 

 
“Brother Shao, do you really want to hold the couple ceremony with me?”
 

 
Although Li Qiaoqiao felt deeply moved by everything her childhood friend had prepared, she thought it was a bit too fast. She didn’t believe brother Shao was after her family background; after all, cultivators were different from mortals. His current cultivation level was vastly improved compared to before, while she was still frail, surviving only thanks to the Li family's resources. She couldn't compare to his former partner.
 

 
“As long as brother Shao wants, it wouldn’t be hard to find a partner of equal cultivation,” Li Qiaoqiao said with a furrowed brow. “I had been feeling a bit better for three days, but it worsened again last night. My condition is so unstable… why bother…”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng fixed his gaze on her, his eyes filled with tenderness and determination. “Don’t think too much. If you’re not well, I’ll take care of you slowly. I don’t want an equal partner; I just want you.”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao was deeply moved.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was speaking the truth. He truly didn’t want a partner who could match him; he wanted a well-bred lady who would always place him first, someone not like Mu Yingchen, who, despite her beauty, didn’t know how to please her husband and always overshadowed him.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had grown tired of that.
 

 
At this moment, he was full of patience for Li Qiaoqiao—every man is typically very patient with a woman he’s interested in but hasn’t fully claimed yet. With sweet words, he made her believe that all she needed to do was focus on her appearance and wait for the couple ceremony. Once he had calmed the anxious Li Qiaoqiao, he switched to another persona and lashed out at his subordinates.
 

 
He had known about Mu Yingchen killing the guards and escaping from the water dungeon that very night. He didn’t think much of it.
 

 
A monk might run, but the temple stays; with her shattered Golden Core and depleted spiritual power, Mu Yingchen was essentially a cripple. Let her run; she could experience the fear of death closing in. Shao Xuanzheng wasn’t worried at all, especially with Li Qiaoqiao, who was becoming increasingly well despite harboring maternal gu.
 

 
However, just yesterday, things changed.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao’s heart condition suddenly worsened that evening. After lying on the couch for an hour, her maid expertly attended to her, and Shao Xuanzheng rushed over in a panic. Seeing him more anxious than herself greatly moved Li Qiaoqiao, who then comforted him.
 

 
But what Shao Xuanzheng was truly anxious about was another matter. Li Qiaoqiao's heart condition shouldn’t have flared up again unless something had changed on Mu Yingchen’s side.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng could only think that she had gone back to her sect for help... but that shouldn’t be! He had anticipated everything she might consider. The North Qing Sect had his spies, and no matter how he inquired or tested the waters, he received no answers. Instead, the North Qing Sect felt a hint of regret for him, having heard the rumors he had spread about being “abandoned by their own disciple.”
 

 
Now it was Shao Xuanzheng who found it hard to endure.
 

 
He was filled with regret.
 

 
Not regret for the wrongs he had committed, but for not having done the job cleanly enough.
 

 
If he had known better, he shouldn’t have let his concerns for his own state of mind get in the way; he should have just killed her.
 

 
Now, he could only hasten the couple ceremony, making the Li family and himself two peas in a pod.
 

 
There are differences between men and women, and it doesn’t sound good for a woman to remarry.
 

 
Cultivators should be more carefree and not bound by trivialities, but Li Qiaoqiao was delicate and couldn’t withstand too much stress.
 

 
If things were to be revealed, the Li family would likely help suppress the matter for Qiaoqiao’s sake... As long as Qiaoqiao was with him, he would treat her well, making her understand that his past with Mu Yingchen was merely a mistake. Besides, the life-exchanging gu he used on Yingchen was also for her sake, right? He was trying to secure a complete future for the two of them.
 

 
With this thought, Shao Xuanzheng felt a sense of calm.
 

 
...
 

 
The couple ceremony was approaching.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng invited everyone he could, including the main branch of the Shao family and cultivators from the South China Sword Sect. Given the prominence of the bride's family, there were even more esteemed guests this time, making the ceremony far more grand and spectacular compared to the one held with the grassroots cultivator Mu Yingchen years ago.
 

 
News spread quickly, and some cultivators who disapproved of Shao Xuanzheng began to gossip. Since Mu Yingchen had gone missing, there had been no word of her; it seemed too quick for him to engage in dual cultivation with someone else, especially with a childhood sweetheart. Who would believe there wasn't something shady going on?
 

 
Supporters of Shao Xuanzheng pointed out that he had invested considerable time and resources in searching for Yingchen, making it clear that his feelings were genuine.
 

 
The critics scoffed, muttering in frustration—
 

 
"Maybe Shao Xuanzheng is just eager to find someone to silence?"
 

 
Regardless of their thoughts, on the day of the couple ceremony, everyone wore smiles.
 

 
The North Qing Sect did not reply, and given their previous comments, Shao Xuanzheng guessed they were too embarrassed to attend. That was fine; even if that woman managed to break the poison curse, she wouldn’t dare cause trouble on his territory alone. Her future would likely involve running away, while he would gain the support of the Li family, paving a smooth path for his cultivation!
 

 
Seeing the smiling faces in the audience, Shao Xuanzheng felt a rush of satisfaction.
 

 
This felt different from the joy he experienced during his first couple ceremony.
 

 
Back then, it was Mu Yingchen's unparalleled beauty that brought him prestige, but few notable figures came to congratulate him. It was already a feat that gifts were sent on behalf of the Shao family, all because Yingchen lacked an impressive family background.
 

 
Today, however, many prominent figures from the South China Sword Sect were in attendance.
 

 
So what if there were private discussions about his relationship with Yingchen?
 

 
In front of him, everyone wore smiles.
 

 
This was the thrill of power and fame!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng remembered how Mu Yingchen used to tell him to focus on cultivation and avoid unnecessary socializing. When it really mattered, no one stepped up to speak for her, simply because she didn’t know how to manage relationships.
 

 
Unlike the vibrant, festive halls of ordinary weddings, the couple ceremony emphasized elegance and purity. Immortal lanterns floated in the air, each arrayed with formations that harnessed the spiritual energy within, creating a dreamlike atmosphere in the grand hall.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao wore a bright red bridal gown, her cheeks flushed.
 

 
She stood beside Shao Xuanzheng, smiling shyly.
 

 
Due to her frail health, this pampered young lady of the Li family seldom showed her face in public. Today, seeing her, people couldn't help but praise her: she was even more impressive in person, a true beauty worthy of the Li family, though her inherent heart condition was regrettable.
 

 
A seasoned onlooker whispered, "If we’re talking about beauty, Mu Yingchen is in a league of her own."
 

 
"You've seen her?"
 

 
Mu Yingchen also rarely appeared in public.
 

 
Her health was robust, and she was quite strong.
 

 
It was said that when she was at the North Qing Sect, she could take on ten opponents easily, although she had a tendency to seclude herself for cultivation. Since the North Qing Sect was located in a frigid region, even flying on a sword required extra spells, or one would suffer the harsh winds. Thus, very few present had ever seen Mu Yingchen.
 

 
"I saw her at the last couple ceremony," the gossiping onlooker described the female lead in eight words: "Unparalleled elegance, captivating beauty.”
 

 
“Really? I don’t believe it.”
 

 
“Shh, don’t say that on Yaoxia Fairy’s big day.”
 

 
The murmurs didn’t reach the stage.
 

 
On stage, Shao Xuanzheng was passionately recounting his difficult journey and how he met Yaoxia Fairy: “Love in this world, like the path of cultivation, is fraught with pitfalls. Fortunately, after all the twists and turns, we found each other again, knowing and loving one another.” He looked down lovingly at the one who held his heart: “Heaven has not been unkind to me.”
 

 
Everyone listening understood that the "pitfalls" he referred to were about Mu Yingchen.
 

 
His eagerness to curry favor with the Li family was too obvious.
 

 
However, no one pointed it out.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was too reclusive; the nature of their relationship was solely in Shao Xuanzheng's words. Who would speak for a stranger? Everyone was more concerned with how to network with other cultivators on this joyous day, to become familiar faces in front of powerful figures and gather the latest news.
 

 
Looking at the two standing side by side, they couldn't help but feel a bit envious.
 

 
“I, Shao Xuanzheng, swear before the heavens that in this life and the next…”
 

 
Just as he was about to make an important vow during this auspicious moment, a sharp sword cry pierced the sky, shattering his words. Everyone instinctively held their breath, turning to the source of the sound.
 

 
It was truly a face of unmatched beauty.
 

 
With features seemingly carved from pristine white snow, she gazed coldly at the stage.
 

 
Her bright eyes shimmered with a faint golden light, characteristic of a peak Golden Core cultivator.
 

 
Easily breaking through layers of formations, she landed in a flowing white robe…
 

 
“See, I wasn’t wrong,” the audacious onlooker whispered, “Yingchen Fairy is way more beautiful than her.”
 

 
The guests couldn't help but murmur among themselves.
 

 
They hadn't heard that Shao Xuanzheng's ex-wife had such high cultivation!
 

 
So why was she here today?
 

 
To cause trouble?
 

 
Aside from those with vested interests, the other invited guests, regardless of their status, transformed into onlookers, secretly hoping for some exciting developments. It had been too dull in the cultivation world; a bit of excitement was rare. If a fight broke out, it would be the talk of the day!
 

 
“On this joyous day for Master Xuanzheng, I apologize for my tardiness.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice rang clearly throughout the hall with a hint of enchantment.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng’s expression darkened, but he was prepared. He retorted, “Yingchen, I have already granted you your freedom. Why have you come today?”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao tightened her grip on his arm, furrowing her delicate brows, and quietly asked him what was going on.
 

 
While calming her, Shao Xuanzheng pulled out a response he had prepared: “Yingchen and I were not compatible. After one argument, we decided to part ways. When she disappeared from the estate that day, I searched everywhere for her… Yingchen, you say our severing of ties was just a moment of anger, but it truly broke my heart. Some words, like spilled water, can never be taken back!”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond immediately, only coldly staring at him.
 

 
Seeing the golden glint in her eyes, he felt a pang of fear.
 

 
What method had this woman used to advance her cultivation instead of regressing? He had clearly shattered her Golden Core while she was poisoned! It was impossible; such a demonic technique couldn't exist… However, with her so splendidly appearing before everyone, he couldn't claim to have treated her poorly!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was not afraid of her causing trouble.
 

 
Today, he had invited his senior brothers and sisters from the South China Sword Sect.
 

 
How could one sword compete against so many?
 

 
He also knew that his ex-wife was not good with words.
 

 
…
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng's guess was correct.
 

 
Whether it was Mu Yingchen's character or the subconscious of Master Lu, neither were inclined to defend themselves; they often found it too tiresome to explain.
 

 
“Shao Xuanzheng, this is a matter for us to resolve,”
 

 
Tong Zhao said, placing her hand on the sword hilt and gently drawing it out.
 

 
A cold light flashed, and the corner of her sleeve billowed in the rising wind.
 

 
“Mu requests a duel!”
 

 
…What the!
 

 
This woman was completely unreasonable!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng hadn't expected her to go this crazy, so he quickly formed a seal to summon his sword.
 

 
He managed to summon it just in time, preparing to block her attack when a massive wave surged from the side, knocking him and Li Qiaoqiao over, sending them tumbling through the air before crashing down.
 

 
“You actually brought helpers to ambush me!”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng roared in anger, turning to glare at the one who had attacked him, only to find it was his senior brother.
 

 
He was stunned.
 

 
Then, he watched as the high platform he had been standing on split apart down the middle.
 

 
That wasn’t just an ordinary platform; it was made from extremely cold glacial rock that he had purchased at a high price beforehand. Its purity and hardness symbolized steadfastness and good fortune.
 

 
The platform made of glacial rock had been split in two by his ex-wife’s sword.
 

 
Was that the strike he had just tried to block?
 

 
If it weren't for his senior brother’s intervention, he would have been the one sliced in half.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt both anger and fear.
 

 
“Mu Yingchen, I intended to treat you with courtesy out of respect for our past as partners, but I didn’t expect you to be so brutal and unreasonable,” he said, clasping his fists. “I earnestly ask the masters of the South China Sword Sect to help me seek justice!”
 

 
The shattered glacial platform filled the once joyous hall with swirling smoke.
 

 
“Partners? Justice?”
 

 
Tong Zhao stood amidst the mist, holding her snow-white sword, her expression unwavering.
 

 
She curved her lips into a stunning smile, captivating even the disciples of the South China Sword Sect, who were naturally on the male side.
 

 
“Shao thief, you poisoned me to seal my powers, shattered my golden core while I was weak, used a life-exchange curse on me, and imprisoned me in a water prison to take my life. Did you ever consider the bonds of partnership? Did you ever think of giving me justice?”
 

 
Her voice rang out, commanding the attention of the guests.
 

 
Yet, it lacked convincing power…
 

 
“What a joke!” Shao Xuanzheng retorted, righteous indignation in his tone. “If I really shattered your golden core, how could you have performed that sword strike just now? Moreover, your words carry neither resentment nor hatred; it seems you have wronged me, and your act doesn’t even look convincing!”
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
The crowd turned to look at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Her face, strikingly beautiful, displayed no joy or sorrow, colder than the sword in her hand.
 

 
Could anyone truly remain unshaken after being treated like that by their husband?
 

 
As the crowd pondered this, Tong Zhao raised her hand to her chest, seemingly disregarding her clothing, and reached for her heart.
 

 
This gesture was even more shocking to the guests than her earlier words.
 

 
Unimpeded by anything, this was the kind of power only a semi-immortal could possess.
 

 
Before everyone’s eyes, Tong Zhao extracted an ugly cursed insect from her heart, suppressed by spiritual power. Accompanied by a wave of her hand, a larger mother insect flew from Li Qiaoqiao’s heart into her grasp.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao coughed up a mouthful of blood.
 

 
“No, Mu Yingchen, you can’t do this, stop her…!”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng shouted in alarm.
 

 
But both insects disintegrated into ashes at Tong Zhao’s command.
 

 
The one who used the curse faced backlash, and Shao Xuanzheng fell to the ground, his face pale.
 

 
He hadn’t expected his ex-wife to not only recover her golden core but also significantly advance in power. How had she accomplished this?
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had intended for his sect to subdue Mu Yingchen first and then find a way to cover up the truth.
 

 
Now, however, the evidence was indisputable, and his brothers dared not intervene.
 

 
“Brother Shao,”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao pushed him away in disbelief, standing up with the maid’s help. “When did you place a curse on me?”
 

 
“Qiaoqiao, I was worried about your health…”
 

 
“Caring for me doesn’t mean you can exchange my life for Mu Yingchen’s! I don’t need it!”
 

 
Thinking back to her recent, inexplicable recovery, Li Qiaoqiao found it absurd and wanted to laugh. How could it be good? Trading her life for a cultivator at the golden core stage! She couldn’t accept it, covering her face and crying, completely unwilling to hear his explanation, fleeing to the protection of her elders, cutting off Shao Xuanzheng’s hopes of gaining the Li family’s assistance.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was left to face the sword-wielding woman alone.
 

 
His eyes reflected confusion, anger, and fear.
 

 
Just like the day when her golden core was shattered after being poisoned.
 

 
At that time, he had looked at his wife with satisfaction, his mind filled with thoughts of ascending, gaining wealth, and replacing her.
 

 
But now, as his ex-wife looked at him, there was not even a hint of pleasure in revenge.
 

 
Cold and detached.
 

 
"You must be curious why my cultivation has improved so rapidly,"
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke slowly, her voice as sharp as a sword's cry. Although her tone was melodious, it sent shivers through the hearts of the guests, and those with lower cultivation began to circulate their spiritual energy to protect their minds. "My golden core was shattered, and my remaining spiritual power was minimal. Today was supposed to be the day of my death due to the life-exchanging curse."
 

 
"Do you remember the Emotionless Venerable?"
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng instinctively responded, "That was your master."
 

 
"Before her ascension, she said she would leave the Emotionless Sword for me."
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng recalled this: "But she didn't!"
 

 
"Right, because you wanted to cultivate the Emotionless Sword with me," Tong Zhao seemed to recall some humorous yet tragic memory, revealing a hint of nostalgia. "I declined my master's good intentions."
 

 
"You found the Emotionless Sword?"
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt he was beginning to understand the situation.
 

 
Every ascendant venerable was a powerful being, so it was quite normal for them to leave treasures for their most trusted disciples.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng started to think about how to rally his brothers and sisters to find an excuse to kill and seize treasures, glancing at his senior brother.
 

 
He secretly rejoiced that the people from the North Qing Sect were not present today.
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed to completely ignore his small gesture and continued, "No, my master took the Love-Cutting Sword with her when she ascended."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao continued, "But she left behind a sword furnace that can still be used once, allowing me to offer my heartfelt love to the furnace.”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng gritted his teeth.
 

 
That master was an old prude who disliked men, and during his pursuit of Mu Yingchen, he had been thwarted by her several times. He never expected that even after ascending, she would still try to make her disciple rid herself of him!
 

 
At this moment, Shao Xuanzheng completely forgot that he held the same thought.
 

 
He showed a face full of humiliation and asked, “So what? Are you going to do the same as your master and kill your husband to prove your path?”
 

 
“Kill the husband to prove the path? Ridiculous.”
 

 
This was something her master had done.
 

 
Even though the victim was a heartless man, it still sounded shocking.
 

 
However, just like in the mundane world, disciples should avoid speaking ill of their masters.
 

 
Anyone could say the master was wrong, but the disciple could not.
 

 
Yet she boldly called it ridiculous?
 

 
Tong Zhao continued:
 

 
“Shao Xuanzheng, you think too highly of yourself. Killing a husband to prove a path is to sever emotional ties—what connection do you and I have? I am here to seek justice for myself, to resolve past grievances, and to clear my own path.”
 

 
“I don’t question why the heavens are unfair to me, nor do I ask why you betrayed me.”
 

 
“From now on, the sword in my hand is my path in my heart,”
 

 
“Those who obstruct me will be punished by the sword!”
 

 
The faces of the disciples from the South Hua Sword Sect changed. They realized she was serious about killing Shao Xuanzheng. If she killed him here, what face would their sect have left? The Shao family wouldn't just stand by; they had invited so many guests today not only for the sake of pride but also with this consideration in mind.
 

 
Layers of pressure descended, trying to deter her actions.
 

 
“Even if Xuanzheng has wronged you, it doesn’t justify killing him outright. Spare his life!”
 

 
She grasped the sword again.
 

 
No fancy moves, no lengthy incantations or gestures.
 

 
What remained was only a pure, fierce, and overwhelming sword intent!
# Chapter57
The oppressive force of various people in the hall was exerted upon Tong Zhao.
 

 
However, that white figure did not waver in the slightest.
 

 
Cold sweat the size of beans dripped down from Shao Xuanzheng's forehead. He firmly believed that his senior brother would save him and not abandon him, so he held on and did not beg for mercy, quietly waiting for his ex-wife to be captured...
 

 
He stared at Tong Zhao, while the director backstage was also focused on the screen.
 

 
"Useless."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu took a puff of his electronic cigarette and shook his head, saying, "If this were a real fantasy world, there would be some reasoning, but this is a movie; the protagonist must be the strongest. Those who oppose her will die."
 

 
Other staff members glanced at each other: "What about the male lead?"
 

 
"I gave him a chance. His trait is being treacherous and malicious. If Shao Xuanzheng hadn't been indulging in the pleasure of kicking his ex-wife in the past few days, and had done more planning or found a way to locate her as soon as he discovered Mu Yingchen had escaped from the water prison... In short, Tong Zhao's subconscious is still far stronger than his. In this competitive film 'Heartless Tribulation', the winner is the protagonist."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pushed off with his toes while sitting in the boss's chair, making the chair spin halfway around. He opened the editing backend of the official page for 'Heartless Tribulation' on his tablet and moved [Chen Zhuzhi] from the protagonist column to the supporting role.
 

 
Only two characters remained in the protagonist column—
 

 
Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pressed confirm to modify, “In the movie, the protagonist can obtain everything.”
 

 
...
 

 
This sword strike was not fast.
 

 
To cultivators, even the usual speed of a sword move appears slow in their eyes, and Tong Zhao's sword strike could be described as leisurely, as if it gave the people from the Sword Sect ample time to stop her. However, when they attempted to stop her, every strike they launched to intercept her failed to even come close.
 

 
In the sword-refining furnace, Fairy Yingchen comprehended her Dao and broke through to the peak of the Golden Core stage.
 

 
Her master had probably long seen that Shao Xuanzheng was no good man. She suspected that her exceptionally gifted disciple might one day realize this and use Shao Xuanzheng as an offering to the furnace.
 

 
But everyone's understanding of the Dao is different.
 

 
What Tong Zhao understood was another matter—
 

 
Lifelong love should be for oneself.
 

 
This concept is often expressed as a cliché, yet very few can truly achieve or comprehend it. Cherishing oneself does not mean being selfish—allowing a disciple to throw themselves into the furnace is also a self-serving act of self-preservation, but Tong Zhao despised doing so; she had her own Dao.
 

 
No sword cultivator is not proud.
 

 
Tong Zhao believed that the sword is the noblest of weapons, and therefore must also possess noble principles.
 

 
When a hundred kinds of weapons charged toward her, they were reduced to powder in an instant.
 

 
The slowness of this sword strike instead gave Shao Xuanzheng enough time to experience the fear and despair of impending death.
 

 
At this moment, she was the butcher, and he was the fish on the chopping block.
 

 
To resolve past entanglements and sever causality, the one who truly possessed a clear path to immortality was her.
 

 
“No... Yingchen, I was wrong...”
 

 
After realizing that no one could save him, Shao Xuanzheng’s true nature was revealed as he frantically pleaded for mercy.
 

 
He was even more horrified to discover that this sword not only cleaved through his physical body but also crushed his soul. The nascent Golden Core, which had just begun to take shape, could not withstand the sharpness, turning into nothingness as well. After the three souls and seven spirits were shattered, they would not enter reincarnation, nor would there be a next life.
 

 
This earth-shattering sword strike flattened the entire great hall.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng completely disappeared.
 

 
Nothing remained.
 
Chen Zhuzhi woke up in the holographic chamber.
 

 
The Shao family was both shocked and enraged, some crushing their tokens to call for reinforcements for revenge. However, at that moment, Qingniang also arrived on the scene with members of the Beiqing Sect and intervened to prevent a bloody battle. The South China Sword Sect, seeing that a person had died completely and that Shao Xuanzheng had made the first mistake, refused to stand up for him, no matter how the Shao family incited them.
 

 
Mu Yingchen's persona is that of a cold and reclusive cultivation fanatic, and she does not have a good reputation within the sect.
 

 
After her master ascended, she left the Extreme Cold Lands and became Dao companions with Shao Xuanzheng. Following his request, she almost cut off all ties with the sect.
 

 
However, her master had paved the way for her.
 

 
As long as she understands herself and strives for her own interests, separating from the bad people and comprehending the Dao of the sword, the sect will have a place for her.
 

 
The Beiqing Sect has mixed feelings about this fellow disciple who has reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. There is anxiety, admiration, nostalgia, and suspicion that she might come to vie for power. Unfortunately, just like her proud and solitary demeanor in white clothing, Tong Zhao inherited only a snow-capped peak from her master and closed the door to solitary cultivation, accompanied by a mortal woman whose timing is too late for entering the cultivation world.
 

 
---
 

 
In the vast land of the Nine Provinces, there are various legends about Mu Yingchen.
 

 
It is said that this Fairy Mu only accepts female disciples.
 

 
No matter how talented or prestigious a male disciple might be, she refuses to meet with them.
 

 
Her direct disciple, like her, remained unmarried for life.
 

 
Before her ascension, Fairy Mu distributed all her treasures equally among the female disciples at the foot of the snow-capped peak. Her direct disciple, Qingniang, received an extra gift: a replica sword forged from extremely rare meteorite iron—the replica of the Snow Name Divine Sword that Fairy Mu carried with her.
 

 
---
 

 
When Tong Zhao opened her eyes in the holographic chamber, Master Lu immediately fled from the position of the host personality.
 

 
Tong Zhao: 【……】
 

 
She ran away too quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood her, after all, someone who is used to the cultivation lifestyle does not enjoy dealing with trivial matters.
 

 
She moved her shoulders a bit and rubbed her buzzing temples.
 

 
Just then, a staff member came over to bring her a hot towel to wipe her face. After wiping her face, she felt much more refreshed.
 

 
Staff Member: "Sister Zhao, you can go rest now."
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" was filmed continuously without any breaks, which placed an even greater mental burden on the actors.
 

 
While the other actors who woke up afterward were still in the chamber and had yet to come to their senses, she was already able to get up and leave. Seeing this, the staff members, who had a deep understanding of the instinctive nature of filming, couldn't help but marvel at how her mind worked—it was truly impressive.
 

 
Tong Zhao stepped out into the corridor; the actor dormitory was one floor up.
 

 
Important roles did not need to share rooms with others and were provided with the best suites.
 

 
As Tong Zhao turned towards the elevator, the door of the holographic filming room, which had a temporary actor nameplate hanging on it, opened from the inside. A beautiful woman in her late twenties with an oval face walked out, locking eyes with her and showing surprise: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan! Can I have your autograph?”
 

 
“I didn’t bring a pen, but can we take a photo together?”
 

 
The beautiful woman nodded enthusiastically, her eyes sparkling with excitement—she was a true fan.
 

 
This temporary actress, named Fu Xiaoheng, felt utterly satisfied after getting a photo with Tong Zhao. When she woke up, she discovered that she was the only one left in the entire extra actors’ room. She also received a text from the staff saying that she performed particularly well and, due to last-minute changes in the plot, her pay would be increased accordingly. She might even have her name listed in the supporting cast section.
 

 
Although she still didn’t know what exactly her role in the plot was, Fu Xiaoheng’s face was filled with joy: “Maybe I had a lot of scenes with you, Sister Zhao! Ah, I won’t take a break; I want to watch the footage right away—wait, but I’m just an extra, so I don’t have the right to watch the footage…”
 

 
Upon saying this, she felt a bit down.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, “If your name is on the supporting cast list, that shouldn’t count as just being an extra, right?”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng explained that they had to wait for the approval process in the backend, and the footage wouldn’t be sent to her dorm room.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out her phone and asked Shi Qianqiu for his opinion. After receiving a response, she said, “Director Shi said I can go to my room to watch it, as long as I don’t take the footage out.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: !!!
 

 
“Really? Won't it cause you any trouble?” She hesitated a bit.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had agreed quite casually, so it probably wasn’t a serious issue.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was so excited that she wanted to hug her, but since they weren’t very familiar, she didn’t dare to do that. Instead, she followed closely beside her, her heart racing with thoughts of writing a lengthy post for social media—What a day! Not only was she promoted from an extra to a named supporting character, but she was also going to watch the footage with the goddess Zhao. Oh my gosh, she wanted to post about it right away!
 

 
Concubine Chen, covering her face with a feather fan, thought: [Can you stop bringing women into your room all the time? It’d be nice to bring a man back for once.]
 

 
Tong Zhao explained, “When I saw her, I felt a sense of familiarity; we probably had scenes together in the film.”
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed correctly.
 

 
The footage sent from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was from the female lead's perspective, and it hadn’t been edited yet, so she didn’t know what the final result would look like. In her mind, everyone gathered on small stools to watch together.
 

 
Although it was the same face, the aura was vastly different.
 

 
So, in the palace of memories, a banner was unfurled, discussing the topic of “who is more handsome, Brother Duan or Master Lu.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Each has their strengths; the grand scenes in xianxia films are more impressive.”
 

 
Female Reporter: “I still prefer the scene where Brother Duan clips the bullets; it’s very tough-guy.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I particularly like the scene where he leaps into the sword furnace; I vote for Master Lu.”
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled, “Master Lu really wields a great sword!”
 

 
Female Reporter: “Pun jokes will cost you.”
 

 
---
 

 
On the other side, Chen Zhuzhi, who had woken up from the capsule much earlier, had already regained most of his memory.
 

 
Although he had been downgraded to a supporting role, the staff didn’t ask him to move out of the suite; he could still stay until the contract with the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew expired. He paced back and forth in his room, feeling anxious, while his manager took two hours to return his call. “Brother Chen, please stop calling me non-stop. I have other artists to manage. When things get busy, I can’t keep up with you. Didn’t you just wake up from the capsule not long ago? You should really be resting now.”
 

 
“Don’t brush me off!”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was annoyed. “Why was my name removed from the lead role section? Listen, the final cut hasn’t come out yet, so there’s still room for negotiation. You need to find a way to pull some strings…”
 

 
After being berated, the manager, feeling a bit displeased, retorted sarcastically, “If you can’t handle your own subconscious, how am I supposed to help you with connections? Why don’t you just ask Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s expression darkened further.
 

 
What he wanted was for his manager to ask Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Last time, because he didn’t want to share money with his ex-girlfriend, Shi Qianqiu had warned him that if he bothered him again, he would find someone to break his legs—he could shamelessly seek help from others, but he truly didn’t dare provoke Shi Qianqiu. This opportunistic manager wasn’t willing to waste any more time on him: “Since you’ve gone from rising to sinking, you might as well settle into being a supporting villain. By the way, if you’re going to be a supporting role in the future, you won’t need your current team; the company will cut down the budget for you, and I’ll assign your assistant to someone else. Just take a break and see if any opportunities come up later.”
 

 
Supporting role!
 

 
After the manager hung up on Chen Zhuzhi, he felt helpless and thought of contacting his ex-girlfriend through Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He called her, appealing to her interests, explaining that he signed a contract, and if he dropped from a lead to a supporting role, his pay would be significantly reduced, which would also lower the compensation he needed to give her.
 

 
His ex-girlfriend laughed, “Director Shi told me that the part you owe me will be directly transferred to my account, no matter how you perform, it won’t affect my share. Did you change your phone number again? I didn’t block this one… Oh well, it doesn’t matter if I block it now. So, you’ve been downgraded from lead to supporting role? That means you didn’t compete with Tong Zhao. Good to know; I’ll buy a ticket to see ‘Heartless Tribulation’ when it comes out. Goodbye!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was certainly not doing charity.
 

 
To have someone with a wicked temperament perform in an instinctive film, he naturally had to bear the relevant risks. He had rich experience dealing with such matters and would never let unrelated issues affect others.
 

 
After all, he needed the subconscious of a villain; he didn’t really like mingling with them.
 

 
This was the second time today that Chen Zhuzhi had his call dropped.
 

 
He slumped on the sofa.
 

 
As long as it wasn’t a serious criminal case involving murder, arson, or strong-arming, instinctive films needed many roles that required a despicable subconscious. However, most of these were supporting roles, and only a very few had the opportunity to be leads. This was because mainstream audiences preferred to see positive, kind-hearted characters.
 

 
Opportunities for villainous leads were fiercely contested.
 

 
The news that he had lost the dual-lead role to Tong Zhao would spread quickly in the industry, effectively closing the door to any future leading roles for him. His subconscious wasn’t remarkable enough; even his villainy was bland and unremarkable. Evil could be charming, but his was not distinct or vivid enough to impress Shi Qianqiu with a compelling narrative. His evil was merely off-putting…
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi covered his face with his hands.
 

 
In his mind, he could hear his manager's scornful mockery, along with his ex-girlfriend's gleeful laughter.
 

 
Then he raised his head, reluctantly and anxiously surveying the exquisite suite.
 

 
The next time he came to the film studio, he would have to share a room with other supporting actors.
 

 
The program team of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had moved Chen Zhuzhi from the lead role section to the supporting role section during the shooting, and keen-eyed fans noticed this and screenshot it, posting it on film forums, sparking a lively discussion.
 

 
Some netizens believed that the dual-lead competitive PK was merely a gimmick—
 

 
[It just increases the workload for post-editing, and is bound to waste one of the actor's performances. Poor Chen Zhuzhi.]
 

 
[What a pity, what’s so tragic about a domestic abuser?]
 

 
[The notorious artist has roles to play thanks to the popularity of instinctive films. Shi Qianqiu’s hiring choices are really cold and merciless. Personally, I’m happy to see Tong Zhao kick him off the lead role; I heard he signed a contract with a betting clause? Dropping to the supporting role means he won’t get any profit shares? Great, I’ll buy a ticket to support!]
 

 
[Rest assured to buy a ticket in support! 1]
 

 
[Am I the only one eagerly looking forward to Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the Fairy Yingchen? And who is this new supporting character, Fu Xiaoheng? Could someone knowledgeable please introduce her?]
 

 
Aside from Tong Zhao, the biggest beneficiary from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was Fu Xiaoheng.
 

 
The crew took new promotional photos of her, placing her fourth in the lineup, right after Ding Jiao.
 

 
Not only did the company improve her treatment, but she also received additional offers for supporting roles.
 

 
Being able to excel as a temporary actor and rise to a supporting role proved that her subconscious was quite expressive.
 

 
The dual-lead competitive filming style of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was very novel, even among instinctive films, and it inherently had a gimmick. With the outcome of this PK, it was delightfully satisfying to see good triumph over evil, which further boosted audience expectations.
 

 
On the pre-sale ranking for viewing rights on online platforms, ‘Heartless Tribulation’ shot straight to first place.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also humorously dubbed the most profitable subconscious.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had stopped speaking in the group chat for the crew, and no one tagged him.
 

 
Ding Jiao privately told Tong Zhao that she suspected Chen Zhuzhi had muted the group.
 

 
And it was probably for the best.
 

 
After all, after the shooting, the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew group chat had instantly turned into Tong Zhao's fan club branch.
 

 
But why was that?
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: “There aren’t many subconscious minds that can handle Brother Shi’s scripts. For this point regarding Sister Zhao, I’m a fan!”
 

 
Modeling Team Guy: “Has Sister Zhao considered becoming a special forces soldier?”
 

 
Props Master: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan!”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “What a coincidence, so am I.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Me too, me too!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was later brought into the group; she didn’t speak much but would always chime in to support Tong Zhao whenever there was a chance to praise her. Originally, Ding Jiao was supposed to have a significant role, but because of Chen Zhuzhi, she ended up becoming a complete supporting character. Fortunately, after Shao Xuanzheng was killed, Li Qiaoqiao stepped up to support Mu Yingchen, which helped her regain some presence.
 

 
Ding Jiao didn’t hold it against Tong Zhao and took this opportunity to build a good relationship with her, hoping for future collaboration opportunities.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse her goodwill.
 

 
In the subsequent promotional efforts for the crew, the friendly interactions among the three female characters further relegated Chen Zhuzhi to the role of a background figure.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was furious about this.
 

 
He didn’t dare to cause trouble, nor did he have the ability to mess with Tong Zhao. What good would it do to make her miserable? If this had happened before filming started, he might have had the chance to scheme against her, but as adults focused on their interests, Chen Zhuzhi wouldn’t act impulsively out of momentary anger.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi shifted his thinking.
 

 
He wanted to create a CP with Tong Zhao to ride her popularity, hoping to turn his luck around.
 

 
In a talk show promoting ‘Heartless Tribulation’, he frequently brought up Tong Zhao, shamelessly trying to win her over—
 

 
—“Ever since I saw Sister Zhao’s debut in ‘The Legend of Emperor Ming’, she has been my favorite actress. I was so happy to know I could work with her that I couldn’t sleep well for three days. I even worried I might actually fall asleep when lying in the holographic chamber.”
 

 
—“My ideal type is Tong Zhao.”
 

 
—“Honestly, it’s normal that I didn’t perform well in the role of Shao Xuanzheng… If it weren’t for the plot, there’s no way I’d break up with such a beautiful wife like Mu Yingchen. I’d hold onto Fairy Yingchen’s thigh and never let go!”
 

 
He looked quite presentable, which was very deceptive.
 

 
Unfortunately, Tong Zhao wasn’t falling for it.
 

 
—“I don’t use Weibo much and rarely watch entertainment news. The first time I heard about you, it was on the front page of a social news article.”
 

 
She directly poked at his history with his abusive ex-girlfriend.
 

 
—“Really? I’m considering a transformation starting today.”
 

 
When he said the last line, the program’s cameras immediately zoomed in on Tong Zhao, who wore a slightly aloof but strikingly beautiful face, clearly showing her disdain. This delighted the director of the talk show, who saw a perfect explosive moment right in front of him—who wouldn’t be happy?
 

 
In the entertainment industry, where everything is usually glossed over, it’s rare for faces to be openly torn apart.
 

 
There were instances in the past, but they have become quite scarce recently.
 

 
Disagreements usually exist between fan groups, while stars greet each other with smiles, leaving no room for leaks.
 

 
There’s only a fine line between being genuine and lacking emotional intelligence.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao showed no intention of picking up the conversation, Chen Zhuzhi felt anxious but also thought that one shouldn’t hit those who smile. He hadn’t offended Tong Zhao, and there was no need for her to deal with him, so he wanted to be extra attentive to her in any encounters they might have—
 

 
However, there were no opportunities at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s agent was much more capable than his.
 

 
What about bribing paparazzi to capture suggestive angles?
 

 
Sister Chu instructed Tong Zhao’s two female assistants to guard her closely, not giving him any chance to approach.
 

 
Afterward, for that episode of the talk show, Sister Chu used her connections and influence to eliminate any possibility of editing it to make it seem like there was mutual interest.
 

 
Sister Chu comforted her: “Don’t worry; Chen Zhuzhi is just a cornered dog. He won’t have many opportunities to appear in front of you again. The only chance he might have to gain some popularity is by creating a CP with you, but he knows he doesn’t deserve it... unless you go crazy and fall in love with him.”
 

 
That possibility was extremely slim; Sister Chu knew her artist was completely focused on her career.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with an “mm.”
 

 
It was impossible for her to go crazy and fall in love with Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
However, while filming the show, Lu Xianchang really wanted to split him in half with a sword.
 

 
And the effect of the show’s airing was that Chen Zhuzhi kept awkwardly calling out to Tong Zhao as if he were acting strangely.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi did have some fans.
 

 
Those who knew he had an abusive ex-girlfriend yet still remained loyal to him were, one can imagine, a particular type. Not only were they not deterred by his desperate behavior, but they also targeted Tong Zhao in the comments and bullet screens.
 

 
[Chen Zhuzhi is still a senior; does Tong Zhao really need to be this rude?]
 

 
[Brother Zhu didn’t really confess to her; he just expressed admiration for a talented junior. Her reaction was too ugly.]
 

 
[Not a fan of anyone, but because of this attitude toward Tong Zhao in the promotion, I’m turning against her.]
 

 
However, the eyes of the crowd were sharp.
 

 
Just as they had begun to forget Chen Zhuzhi’s past misdeeds, Tong Zhao’s comment about the social news reminded them again.
 

 
Right, he’s a legal-themed celebrity!
 

 
Netizens helped to mock him back, while Tong Zhao’s fans had always been more laid-back...
 

 
Up until “The Sea King’s Kill.”
 

 
After “The Sea King’s Kill” aired, a special group emerged among Tong Zhao’s fans, not large in number but strong in combat power: the girlfriend fans of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were irrational and unreasonable, and Tong Zhao’s fans initially didn’t plan to pay them any attention. However, after several days of not seeing normal content and being bothered, some of the more sensitive fans even considered unfollowing her.
 

 
The so-called only magic can defeat magic came into play at that moment, as Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans rallied to protect their idol—
 

 
[Stop pretending to be bystanders; who besides the little punching bags would speak for the legal celebrity?]
 

 
[So heartbroken for her, being forced to promote alongside a scumbag.]
 

 
[Ew, could the legal-themed celebrity keep their distance from our sister? Be careful, or she might send your brother to the afterlife with a punch.]
 

 
Not only did they fight back, but they also provided various well-organized pieces of evidence against Chen Zhuzhi, proving his past wrongdoings.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were left dumbfounded.
 

 
This wasn’t right. In the past, whenever they targeted female celebrities’ fans, besides the occasional ridicule from bystanders, they never encountered any real opponents. Why did they hit a wall this time? The arguments sounded so familiar, almost like those from other male celebrities' fan wars.
 

 
Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans didn’t waste time arguing with them; they chased after Chen Zhuzhi for two days, and once they confirmed that his fans wouldn’t dare to fight back, they returned victorious.
 

 
Only confused Chen fans and onlookers were left behind.

# Chapter58
An analysis post suddenly appeared on a forum, and within half an hour, it became a hot topic.
 

 
Two hours later, the moderator highlighted it, showing just how exciting it was.
 

 
The poster was a new media writer who usually earned a living writing articles about mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts, bizarre matchmaking stories, workplace troubles, and similar topics. Occasionally, they would also post fabricated stories on various forums to drive traffic to their public account—essentially using sensational content to “entice” netizens to follow the thread, and when they couldn’t get enough, they would end with a tease: “To know more, please follow xxxxxx.”
 

 
There’s expertise in every field, and regardless of quality, writers of this kind know how to grab attention right from the start.
 

 
Moreover, this time, the information being revealed was genuine.
 

 
The poster first provided a brief summary of the background.
 

 
The gist of this story was straightforward, even for netizens who didn’t follow the entertainment industry.
 

 
It involved the fans of the female lead and the original male lead of the upcoming film ‘ Heartless Tribulation’, set to release next month, getting into a heated argument.
 

 
[Huh? Why are the male and female leads’ fans fighting? Is it over their roles?]
 

 
[What do you mean by “original male lead”?]
 

 
[It means that in ‘The Heartless Tribulation’, Tong Zhao kicked Chen Zhuzhi out of the main lead position.]
 

 
Thanks to the enthusiastic explanations from fans of instinctive films, bystanders quickly understood the situation.
 

 
Fair competition.
 

 
It was entirely normal for the subconscious not to perform well and to be outdone by others.
 

 
Since he signed a gambling contract, he should accept the outcome.
 

 
The poster then shared an edited clip from Chen Zhuzhi's promotional program, which heavily implied his desperation. If The female lead politely accepted the situation, even without explicitly reciprocating any feelings, she would likely end up being marketed as a sugar couple (CP) by the marketing team behind Chen Zhuzhi. He would effectively ride on the female lead's popularity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao almost carved the word "disdain" on her forehead.
 

 
The effort to create a CP (couple) turned into a one-sided attachment.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were not having it, and they began to act sarcastic across various forums and Weibo, staging a virtual Three Kingdoms battle—
 

 
Chen Fans (Loyal): "Brother is just kindly taking care of the junior, worried that Tong Zhao wouldn’t get enough screen time, so he mentioned her more. Who would have thought she would turn around and bite him? How about a little politeness from the junior?"
 

 
Chen Fans (Neutral): "Just two sides of fans enjoying the show, they didn’t see the male lead's desperation, only that Tong Zhao’s emotional intelligence is quite low."
 

 
Chen Fans (Opposition): "Chen is only fit to be our Zhao Zhao goddess's lapdog/laughs / laughs."
 

 
Loyalty masquerading as opposition, counter-fans, and fake bystanders...
 

 
A variety of advanced tactics that would leave even seasoned players in the Three Kingdoms game in awe kept emerging. Combined with their aggressive tactics in the forums, they had previously managed to provoke Tong Zhao’s generally passive fans to the point where they had no temper left to fight back—
 

 
Since she wasn't following the typical idol path, her management focused more energy and marketing budget on securing mid to high-end endorsements for her. As long as there weren’t any major issues, they basically ignored the data; as long as she was doing well, it was fine. After all, among her peers, Tong Zhao was already far ahead, and the general audience showed interest in her name in film and television works.
 

 
Netizens following the posts at the top floor marveled at the spectacle.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was definitely not a top-tier actor among male actors.
 

 
He had been in the industry for a while, benefiting from the large population in China, where a smaller base was easier to manipulate. Moreover—
 

 
‘If I can't beat the fans of other male stars, how could I possibly lose to the fans of a female actor?’
 

 
This current state of affairs left netizens feeling a mix of pity and amusement.
 

 
[Why can't he win? Tong Zhao's recent works have been quite popular.]
 

 
Poster: "The law of the internet is that the more brainless you are, the more advantageous it becomes.”
 

 
Poster: "Actually, it's not just the fan community or the internet. Throughout history, countless civilizations have been trampled and destroyed by barbaric forces because barbarism often gives rise to greater military capabilities (of course, this has become rare since the nuclear era), but this phenomenon still occurs frequently online."
 

 
[66666]
 

 
[The poster is quite the cultured person. If you don’t have your big work at the next book fair, I’m not going.]
 

 
[It's not that fans are born brainless; it's that the toxic teams behind the stars find ways to nurture these mindless behaviors. Essentially, they are just legal large-scale multi-level marketing teams, which is unsolvable.]
 

 
Compared to smart people, it's much easier to make money off foolish ones.
 

 
Cutting leeks (a term for profiting off fans) from fans is just making money; there's nothing shameful about it.
 

 
Poster: "Chen Zhuzhi's fans had a good strategy; at first, Tong Zhao's fans indeed couldn’t compete."
 

 
Poster: "But they overlooked one point—"
 

 
Immediately after, the poster shared several screenshots.
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans were also pretty laid-back since there was no ranking to fight for.
 

 
Not long after ‘Sea King Kill’ aired, the perfume endorsement ad came out, and fans were just enjoying the visuals and boosting sales as their daily task. However, the fans of Chen Zhuzhi were running into trouble.
 

 
This official fan account was purely grassroots, and the head was a hot-tempered rich girl.
 

 
Ever since she started following Han Zhi, she put down her keyboard and was forced to adopt a more laid-back approach to fan culture, searching daily for her brother's name and chatting with her friends.
 

 
As a result, she stumbled upon the insults from Chen Zhuzhi's fans.
 

 
The head of the fan group understood the origin of the situation and, confirming it wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, immediately jumped in.
 

 
First screenshot:
 

 
@Han Zhi’s Fan Club: "Are you still cursing?"
 

 
[Han Zhi’s Plaza Screenshot.JPG]
 

 
The second screenshot showed that Chen Zhuzhi's fans had been counter-attacked for two days; no matter where they appeared in related trending news, they were immediately ridiculed to the point of being unrecognizable. The previous tactics of pretending to be neutral and incognito had all been exposed by Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans, with a clear chain of evidence and straightforward posters, making it easy to understand and direct, swiftly confusing the originally dominant male fans.
 

 
The attitudes of Han Zhi’s fans could be categorized into two types.
 

 
1:
 

 
Don’t think that Tong Zhao has no one; they’re all supporting her.
 

 
2:
 

 
Your brother’s desperate attempts to ride the wave of popularity are all too obvious. My side refuses to be tied down; for every time he tries to cling on, we’ll strike back.
 

 
The fan community has evidently developed into its own distinct system, with its own ecology and rules.
 

 
Onlookers were baffled, not understanding why Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were silenced so quickly.
 

 
The leader of Han Zhi’s fan group was a seasoned fangirl, aware that when engaging in battles, you have to hit the opponent where it hurts. Essentially, this was a display of force that inadvertently intimidated potential competitors.
 

 
After the poster provided some commentary, they concluded with a theatrical phrase:
 

 
[Perhaps the best way to maintain peace is for everyone to be armed.]
 

 
[Only magic can defeat magic. Through this example, we get a glimpse of a fan community rivalry. It’s worth pondering: what would happen if any non-idol actor were in the same situation?]
 

 
After being shared, netizens humorously referred to this as a perfect essay.
 

 
Not only did it pinpoint the central theme, but it also elevated the content.
 

 
……
 

 
“Reflecting on fan culture: Counting Chen Zhuzhi's seven deadly sins.”
 

 
“The truth behind the Tong Zhao and Chen Zhuzhi fan war— the desperate struggle of a washed-up celebrity.”
 

 
“In an era of instinctive filmmaking where skill cannot be enhanced through effort, has the dominance of the subconscious effectively stifled this industry...? Wow, this article seems quite favorable to Chen Zhuzhi but has a rather unique angle. However, the topic of instinctive filmmaking being unrelated to acting has been thoroughly discussed. Times change like this; we cannot alter the era, only adapt to it.”
 

 
Manager Chu loudly read three pieces of news.
 

 
What is Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
She’s intensely replying to messages on WeChat.
 

 
Perhaps due to having traversed many worlds, Tong Zhao is quite resilient to loneliness. Compared to her peers, she is a rare breed that doesn’t easily bow down. However, every time she finishes a gig or wraps up a film, her WeChat contacts grow longer…
 

 
She can ignore the guys, but she must reply to the girls to some extent.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao engrossed in her phone, Manager Chu, feeling a bit lonely, asked her, “We just won a brilliant victory. Aren’t you going to go over the details?”
 

 
“You handle it,” Tong Zhao replied, looking up and giving her a smile with her stunningly attractive face, “I trust you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Manager Chu thought to herself, “Trust you, my foot!”
 

 
She’s just too carefree. In the first couple of days, she was mercilessly attacked by Chen Zhuzhi’s fans, and her private messages were filled with bloody, disgusting images. Yet she didn’t waver even slightly and seemed to be having fun, casually downloading two particularly horrifying images to send to Wei Zekai. In the end, her manager dealt with everything.
 

 
Of course, the company wasn’t just idly sitting by.
 

 
That post was crafted by a skilled professional that manager Chu hired, along with a series of paid articles.
 

 
Even if Chen Zhuzhi’s fans didn’t confront Han Zhi’s fans directly, the company had long been prepared to fight back and debunk rumors. This time, the counterattack was executed perfectly, and Tong Zhao’s manager shifted from being the main attacker to providing support. Not only did they play their cards well, but when the other side misplayed, they struck back and declared, “I heard Zanchao Entertainment has already given up on Chen Zhuzhi and left him to fend for himself.”
 

 
“Sounds good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded in appreciation.
 

 
How could she maintain a lofty attitude while being in the industry?
 

 
At the very least, she needed to know how to protect herself. She wouldn’t actively suppress others through underhanded tactics, but she didn’t want anyone to provoke her either.
 

 
Honestly, being protected by her female fans felt quite nice.
 

 
The issue with Chen Zhuzhi's fans came to a conclusion, and there was no possibility of the two collaborating again.
 

 
“Let’s not talk about this unfortunate matter anymore,” manager Chu perked up. “How are you considering the invitation to the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had already been looking into the arrangements for the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala.
 

 
They had invited her to perform on stage.
 

 
Litchi TV is a major platform. Although Tong Zhao was popular, she was still a rising star, and it was unlikely they would give her a solo performance at such an important event. They had invited Song Wanzhuo as well, thinking of creating some buzz with a couple’s act, singing a traditional duet. The specific song hadn’t been finalized yet, but the male side had no objections; they were just waiting for her input. Tong Zhao chatted with Song Wanzhuo on WeChat for a while and felt quite comfortable about it, seeing it as a chance to give a little treat to the ancient couple’s fans.
 

 
What she said was: “It’s a pity we don’t have couple vibes.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied: “That’s hard to say; sometimes I feel a strong connection, and other times I think of you as my buddy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about it and figured that Song Wanzhuo probably only liked her portrayal as Concubine Chen.
 

 
This was normal.
 

 
“Liking all sides of you” is a type of filter; in reality, most people’s affection for someone usually stems from a specific trait, which then expands to a broader understanding—like how Song Wanzhuo was captivated by Concubine Chen’s multifaceted charm, leaving a lasting impression that was hard to forget. Ordinary people often grapple with thoughts like “Does he really like me, or just the version of me that’s XXX?” So, it was even more complicated for someone as multifaceted as Tong Zhao.
 

 
Both Tong Zhao and her manager didn’t want to miss this opportunity to appear.
 

 
Singing alongside Song Wanzhuo was considered a strong collaboration, so they tentatively agreed.
 

 
Manager Chu asked, “Do you want me to find you a teacher?”
 

 
She was worried that Tong Zhao might not know how to sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied that it wasn’t necessary; she could sing.
 

 
She didn’t sing much herself, but she had sung a lot out of boredom in ancient times.
 

 
After all, she had to serve others with her talents, and she was skilled in singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments: “I can play the piece; I can also handle the accompaniment.”
 

 
Manager Chu glanced at her.
 

 
She understood her competitive nature too well; once she stepped on stage, she aimed to do her best. Though she acted nonchalant, in reality, she was determined to steal the show and wouldn’t miss any opportunity to shine. Such an artist was just…
 

 
So easy to manage!
 

 
“Okay, I’ll communicate with the director.”
 

 
Manager Chu was satisfied.
 

 
The music director of Litchi TV approved the request, and the final song was set to be a duet of “A Smile Captivates the Heart,” with her playing the accompaniment. Song Wanzhuo’s manager initially had some concerns, feeling it would overshadow the male lead, and that it would be fairer if they all sang together. However, Song Wanzhuo had a strong opinion and influence in the company; he wanted to see his goddess play the guzheng. What was wrong with letting her take some of the spotlight? Men shouldn’t be so petty.
 

 
Once this was settled, the news was released.
 

 
Originally, the hottest news surrounding Tong Zhao was the completion of "Heartless Tribulation" and her feud with Chen Zhuzhi, but when the public saw the guest list for Litchi TV's New Year’s Gala, they thought, “Oh wow, Tong Zhao is going to be there, and she’ll be singing with Song Wanzhuo!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's reputation and accomplishments far surpassed those of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
The latter’s fans didn’t dare to provoke him.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo posted a very formal Weibo thanking for the collaboration opportunity and tagged the official account of “The Legend of Ming Emperor.” Fans recalled that this was one of his important works, and many new fans had come from that drama. They were simply happy for him to see the Ming Emperor and his concubine on stage together for New Year’s.
 

 
[Supporting the joint performance, will you wear formal wear that day? Why not just wear the costumes from the drama?]
 

 
[Thanks to Litchi TV for the invitation; we’ll see you on New Year’s, big brother!]
 

 
[Seeing through my brother's restrained joy/dog emoji]
 

 
[What? The Song-Zhao couple is resurrecting and giving us sweetness?]
 

 
The fourth comment was relatively discordant.
 

 
The super topic for this ancient couple had long been neglected; no one managed it anymore, and only drama fans occasionally mentioned it.
 

 
When "Sea King Kill" premiered, Song Wanzhuo made sure his fans knew about his admiration for Tong Zhao. His direct and playful way of fandom brought some outside heat and goodwill from bystanders. Fans politely clarified things, and after realizing there were no further ambiguous signs between the two, they felt reassured.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were incredibly frustrated.
 

 
After being mocked a few times and not seeing any chance for a comeback, they scattered like monkeys when the tree fell, all jumping ship.
 

 
This series of discussions brought some heat to "Heartless Tribulation," allowing this big female lead fantasy film to enter the public's view, ranking first in the most anticipated releases list by a significant margin.
 

 
In the era of instinctive cinema, films are made quickly and released even faster.
 

 
Bad movies can result in huge losses, while the winners take it all.
 

 
#Movie "Heartless Tribulation" Premiere#
 

 
#Tong Zhao#
 

 
#Shi Qianqiu#
 

 
How high are the audience’s expectations for this movie?
 

 
From the day "Heartless Tribulation" was released, the number of visitors to the holographic mall clearly reflected this.
 

 
Although it was a weekend holiday, the data flow from netizens clearly indicated one thing — they were going to watch the movie, and it was Tong Zhao's "Heartless Tribulation."
 

 
The advantage of holographic viewing is that you can still get tickets even when the crowd is huge.
 

 
However, the rooms set up by streamers to chat with fans during the viewing do have a limit on the number of participants. Even small streamers can attract a lot of netizens when they tag "Heartless Tribulation," which is a clear indication of how popular this movie is.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi has been relegated to a supporting role.
 

 
It’s obvious who attracts the public and who carries the box office.
 

 
At the offline premiere of "Heartless Tribulation," Tong Zhao wore a pearl-white evening gown, the skirt adorned with layers of scattered diamonds. Her manager repeatedly reminded her that the team had invested heavily in this dress, and her presence had to live up to their efforts:
 

 
“We don’t intend to give Chen Zhuzhi any face; tonight, you are the absolute star.”
 

 
“I know you have a good relationship with the other two female supporting roles, but you must outshine everyone tonight.”
 

 
Tong Zhao fully understood.
 

 
She initially planned to attend alone, but after hearing that the character Concubine Chen could steal the show, she eagerly requested to take the lead role for a while. Tong Zhao readily agreed, as they shared success and would face challenges together.
 

 
A female reporter teased her: "A movie starring Lu Xianzhang lets you steal the spotlight?"
 

 
Concubine Chen replied: "I work the fields while the horse eats grain; if the other side makes money, I enjoy the benefits. There's no shame in that."
 

 
Since recovering her memories from "Heartless Tribulation," Lu Xianzhang seemed to have new insights and had been secluded, so she naturally did not come out to confront concubine Chen at this moment.
 

 
To withstand the grandeur of the event, Tong Zhao’s makeup and hairstyle today were particularly elaborate.
 

 
The dress was tightly fitted at the waist, accentuating her graceful curves.
 

 
The makeup artist applied highlighter to her body, making her a luxury item that was expensive, beautiful, and of high taste —
 

 
Stepping out of the car with the aura of "outshining the crowd," she descended from the ceremonial vehicle.
 

 
Countless flashbulbs lit up concubine Chen, as if she had been washed by a rain of light. Long cameras and short ones aimed at her face, wanting to capture her most authentic side. Unscrupulous media outlets aimed to photograph her less flattering angles, knowing that flawed photos are often more eye-catching.
 

 
However, there was nothing to capture.
 

 
Even in rapid-fire snapshots, no flaws could be detected.
 

 
In this crowded and scrutinized occasion, concubine Chen recalled the grand ceremony where she was conferred as a noble consort, with countless ladies bowing deeply to her. She lazily swept her gaze over their bowed heads, feeling a swell of power and a hint of bored indifference…
 

 
This surplus of confidence elevated concubine Chen's radiant makeup, making all the precious jewels adorning her simply embellishments to her beauty; no matter how large or dazzling the gems, they could not overshadow her brilliance.
 

 
Concubine Chen had only one thought —
 

 
Why didn’t these people kneel down while taking her picture?
 

 
……
 

 
The aura of the noble consort was overwhelming; whether it was the front-line stand-ins, media reporters, or simply the lucky audience members who received premiere invitations, every candid shot that circulated online was stunning.
 

 
[So beautiful, wow! Let me appreciate the empress's beauty.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's looks are truly exceptional. I actually think Chen Zhuzhi might not just be trying to ride on her fame; he genuinely likes her. Who can resist a beautiful woman?]
 

 
[Demon monsters, please leave! Can we stop mentioning that person?]
 

 
While anxiously waiting for the "Confirm Viewing" button to change from gray to green, netizens could only refresh various news related to the premiere, resulting in wave after wave of Tong Zhao's event photos.
 

 
Of course, she was undeniably the first female lead.
 

 
But "Heartless Tribulation" didn't just have her in it; they had to give others some screen time too, right?
 

 
Just as netizens were calling for more photos of others, pictures of Tong Zhao alongside her co-stars were released.
 

 
Uh...
 

 
[Is this a photo of a big star with a regular beauty?]
 

 
[What happened to Jiao Jiao? Ugh, the stylist should be punished!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s dress can’t be cheap; her team is really impressive.]
 

 
It’s not just about the evening gown.
 

 
If it were Tong Zhao, she might consider letting her girlfriends shine together and look beautiful in group photos, but who is concubine Chen? She’s not anti-female nor targeting the same sex; she equally looks down on everyone. She wants to outshine the crowd and make sure the emperor sees only her!
 

 
Concubine Chen never threatens the other consorts to appear barefaced.
 

 
Nor does she fear them sending the emperor secret glances.
 

 
Because with her present, it’s useless for the other consorts to dress up like golden statues.
 

 
The aura effect that the system can extract is beyond comparison.
 

 
In short, the outcome of that group photo was nothing short of disastrous.
 

 
In modern society, there are no emperors, and at the premiere, there isn't a very important domineering CEO that concubine Chen needs to flatter and please. The concubine doesn’t know what it means to know when to back off. Her presence was felt throughout the event, and every male guest attending the premiere was captivated by her charm.
 

 
Wasn't the agent telling Tong Zhao to perform well and outshine everyone?
 

 
Well, what she did was a perfect score. No thanks needed; just kneel in admiration.
 

 
Before the screening began, concubine Chen, satisfied, went to rest, while Tong Zhao sat down in her pre-arranged seat and rubbed her forehead.
 

 
Brother Duan: "Zhao Zhao, were you asleep just now? I suggest you check your WeChat."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, let the concubine handle the socializing for me. What’s up?"
 

 
Brother Duan: "Uh... you’ll know when you see it."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the big screen.
 

 
She realized the movie hadn't started yet, so she took out her phone from her handbag and opened WeChat.
 

 
She discovered that there was a new category added in her contacts—
 

 
Fish Pond:
 

 
- Director of Litchi Entertainment
 
- Music Director of North China
 
- Executive of Yunsanglong Culture
 
- ...
 

 
The list was astonishingly long.
 

 
It was hard to imagine how so many people could be added in such a short time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Concubine, let’s talk."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "They’re all fools who would give up their entire fortune just to see me smile a couple of times. I’ll keep them around; they’re useful. Don’t worry, I’m very good at managing personal space. No one will try to pull any hidden rules on you; their admiration will only stay at the level of appreciation and adoration. They all wanted to add me themselves."
 

 
Hearing this, it was clear she was an old pro at this game.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Hiss.”
 

 
If her life were a stock trading novel, readers would probably have no idea whose stocks to buy.
 

 
She could only indulge her own personality and flirt blindly.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t angry; she just took it as a chance to show her face.
 

 
The seats for the male and female leads were initially arranged together, but manager Chu directly discussed with Shi Qianqiu, explaining that her artist didn’t want to sit next to Chen Zhuzhi. Could they make some adjustments? Shi Qianqiu readily agreed, so the seating was changed to Tong Zhao sitting between Fu Xiaoheng and him.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was overjoyed and whispered, "Master, Master!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao thought she had broken character.
 

 
If it were a male actor like Song Wanzhuo, Tong Zhao would have snapped him out of it right then and there. But she had a bit more patience with girls. She wanted to ask Lu Xianzhang to come out and socialize with her apprentice, but since Lu Xianzhang was in a silent retreat, she gave up that thought and silently noted that Fu Xiaoheng was out of luck: "I’m here. What’s up?"
 

 
"I’m really happy to see you. Ever since I regained my memories, I’ve wanted to call you Master."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was actually a generation older than Tong Zhao, and when she smiled, there were fine lines at the corners of her eyes.
 

 
However, influenced by the memories from "Heartless Tribulation," she looked at Tong Zhao with adoring eyes, like a complete little fan.
 

 
This is one of the downsides of modern filmmaking!
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, go ahead and call me that."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng wanted to reminisce further.
 

 
But at that moment, the lights dimmed around them, and the screen slowly lit up…
# Chapter59
There is a saying commonly passed around:
 

 
"If you haven't acted in an instinctive movie, you've wasted your life."
 

 
Instinctive movies have an insatiable demand for extras.
 

 
For ordinary people, becoming an extra is not something unattainable. Many have "appearing in an instinctive movie" on their list of "things to accomplish before turning twenty," and many teenagers say that only after experiencing an instinctive movie do they realize how ordinary their "true selves" really are.
 

 
The experience of acting in an instinctive movie is also extremely unique.
 

 
The memories recalled in the mind are from a first-person perspective, which is different from the viewing angle when watching sample footage.
 

 
The final edited version, after post-production, is yet another thing altogether—
 

 
Since entering the era of instinctive movies, one of the most crucial tasks for directors has been film editing.
 

 
After the actors wrap up, Shi Qianqiu and his editing team "enter" ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ countless times, repeatedly using their own ideas and aesthetics to create the final version.
 

 
For instance, Tong Zhao had to go back and reshoot several scenes depicting Mu Yingchen and Shao Xuanzheng's memories when they were still a dual-cultivation couple.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang's subconscious couldn't handle acting out his dual cultivation life, so Tong Zhao had to step in herself to barely manage the plot setting of "the two being a couple" and complete the flashback scenes.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt she didn't do a good job in that segment.
 

 
At that time, Shi Qianqiu reassured her, saying he had a way to edit the scenes later, adding some details to make it more convincing.
 

 
If good subconscious performances from actors are like lyrics, the director is the composer.
 

 
Thus, the birth of good work requires both.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also curious how Shi Qianqiu would use editing to make up for her stiff performance... The Mu Yingchen she portrayed, although not outright cutting him down with a sword, showed a cold, disinterested attitude—a clear indication of a superficial relationship. There was no way to convey the contrast of someone who once deeply loved her husband, only to sever all ties after being betrayed.
 

 
The entire hall darkened completely.
 

 
...
 

 
The screen lit up with a classic aerial view of the Nine Provinces.
 

 
Many towering mountains shrouded in clouds came into view, followed by smooth cuts—
 

 
A vast, desolate, snow-covered icy landscape appeared, and in this barren whiteness, a slender, tall figure was captured in a low-to-high shot. Her jet-black hair fell gracefully, and she was the only trace of darkness in the scene, naturally drawing the audience's attention to her silhouette.
 

 
Then, she turned around.
 

 
Everyone knew this should be the female lead, Tong Zhao.
 

 
Almost all the audience knew what Tong Zhao looked like.
 

 
She’s been incredibly popular lately, and everyone must be very familiar with her face!
 

 
However, in that fleeting moment when she turned around, the audience was still stunned by her beauty, holding their breath for a second, unwilling to blink—
 

 
The moonlight illuminated Tong Zhao's face, cold and flawless.
 

 
If ordinary celestial maidens are like the distant, unattainable mist and clouds, then she is the wind and snow in a lonely, desolate mountain—proud and cold, with an air of solitary elegance. Her beautiful face was slightly raised, and as the snowflakes were about to land on her long lashes, they were shattered into powder by an invisible sword aura, dissolving into the wind before they could touch her.
 

 
[Oh my God, is she the real celestial being!]
 

 
[How can the same face be so powerful? Or is Tong Zhao actually a set of triplets? Although the face is the same, there are three different people behind it! The temperament is so distinct!]
 

 
[Got myself a stunning screensaver. Director Shi still knows how to shoot grand scenes. You can tell he’s a young master from a wealthy family.]
 

 
[This modeling isn’t just blowing wind and snow; it’s blowing money.]
 

 
The audience felt as though they were seeing her anew.
 

 
Amateurs focus on the spectacle, while experts see the technique.
 

 
Some film critics were already whispering to each other about Tong Zhao’s subconscious performance highlights this time.
 

 
Instinctive films of different genres each have their own challenges. For fantasy and immortal-themed films, it’s rare for anyone to capture the ethereal aura in the details.
 

 
It’s not just about having a pretty face.
 

 
Some subconscious performances, even if capable of summoning lightning with one hand and calling rain with the other, still come across as ordinary when dressed in a grand mage’s robe.
 

 
However, Lu Xianzhang’s subconscious, with just this single detail, allowed the audience to easily accept the image of "a cultivator"—these were all habits deeply ingrained in her subconscious daily life.
 

 
“Immortal Shao,”
 

 
Even her voice was cold, carrying a chill that could sting the face, with a hint of doubt: “Did you come all the way from the Nanhua Sword Sect just to meet me for the second time?”
 

 
Then, a series of montages conveyed to the audience the story of the two meeting, falling in love, and becoming cultivation partners.
 

 
“I, Shao Xuanzheng, vow by the sword in my hand and the path I uphold, to love only Mu Yingchen in this life.”
 

 
The clear and cheerful male voice echoed through the sky.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng, with a high-spirited look, his hair tied with a long hairpin, his handsome face complemented by his sky-blue robe, stood on a high platform like a nobleman stepping out of a painting. The light behind him outlined a glowing edge around him...
 

 
Tong Zhao finally understood what Shi Qianqiu meant by "a little detail."
 

 
In this long opening flashback, he made the male lead look particularly handsome, using various angles with ample surrounding light.
 

 
Next, he edited it as if it was the male lead through the eyes of the female lead—
 

 
The long shot showed her gazing at him with a pounding heart.
 

 
The medium shot showed them exchanging meaningful glances.
 

 
The close-up showed her lingering gaze, full of reluctance to part.
 

 
The idea is that when you like someone, you see them with a halo around them.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu used this mindset to draw the audience’s attention while guiding their thoughts in the direction he intended—that the female lead deeply loved the male lead, admired his charisma, and saw him through a thick, ten-layer filter of admiration.
 

 
Tong Zhao, watching with a detached and calm attitude, actually found herself convinced.
 

 
Seeing everyone around her engrossed in the movie, she knew she couldn’t engage in unprofessional behavior like whispering throughout the film, nor could she play on her phone and send WeChat messages. She had a strong urge to share her thoughts but had nowhere to express them—thankfully, she still had "herself"—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Wow, it really looks like I was madly in love with the male lead.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [The director has quite an artistic vision.]
 

 
Usually the most talkative, Concubine Chen was silent. Tong Zhao thought she might have been upset by the earlier comment about her switching partners rapidly and was about to console her when she heard brother Duan say: [She just woke Lu Xianzhang up forcefully.]
 

 
What happened?
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Quick, look at the movie scene Zhaozhao just saw. That’s your character.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang wasn’t keen on responding, but since they shared the same person and the same brain, the memories were shared. When Lu Xianzhang saw herself deeply in love with Shao Xuanzheng through Shi Qianqiu’s romantic editing, even someone as experienced as her almost had a minor breakdown: [......]
 

 
So, Lu Xianzhang, having just appeared, quickly withdrew into seclusion again.
 

 
Concubine Chen was delighted and joyfully fanned herself.
 

 
Apart from Tong Zhao and the post-production team of “The Heartless Tribulation”, who knew the truth, the rest of the audience was completely immersed in the movie's storyline. In the first less-than-ten-minute opening, the director sparingly gave the female lead few scenes, focusing more on "Shao Xuanzheng as seen through the eyes of the female lead." But whenever she appeared, every frame was unforgettable.
 

 
She was practicing swordsmanship alone on the peak of Nanhua Sword Sect.
 

 
In the past, she was "Immortal Mu" or "Fairy Yingchen." Now, people called her "Immortal Shao's partner."
 

 
After her master ascended, she returned to the immortal sect once and stood for a long time before the cliff engraved with the words "Heart Severance Peak."
 

 
The snow-white robe, once perfectly fitted, now seemed oversized on her, conveying a sense of loneliness and suggesting through visual cues that her post-marriage life outside the sect had not been happy.
 

 
There had been verbal disputes between the two.
 

 
Mu Yingchen's cultivation level was higher than his, but she never liked to argue with him. Each conflict ended in an unpleasant and unresolved manner.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu really knows how to film beautiful women.]
 

 
[Chen Zhuozhi’s performance doesn’t seem bad here? Why was he relegated to a supporting role?]
 

 
[“Not bad” my foot! Stay away from Fairy Yingchen! Zhaozhao should shine alone!]
 

 
In the first fifteen minutes, the crew successfully portrayed a reticent and aloof "Immortal Mu," whom the audience became accustomed to seeing always dressed in spotless white, with a flawless face. Though her perfection seemed almost unreal, it was still enjoyable—who doesn’t love watching a beauty?
 

 
A great beauty just needs to be responsible for being beautiful!
 

 
Besides, she was so powerful.
 

 
Was Tong Zhao's subconscious too strong, turning ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ into a movie where the heroine remains stunning throughout? It's not impossible. ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’ was also a film where she single-handedly dominated the entire show, and the response was good. Short, highly-praised reviews said that movie was both stress-relieving and exhilarating to watch.
 

 
Just as the audience began to wonder how the story would unfold, the hints laid earlier started to come together—
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was jealous of his partner’s talent and longed for his first love, his “white moonlight.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen never guarded against him.
 

 
At least, that’s the information conveyed through the editing.
 

 
When the audience saw Shao Xuanzheng plotting multiple schemes to poison her and destroy her golden core while she was weak, the comment section exploded:
 

 
[Oh my god, this scumbag is inhuman!]
 

 
[Fairy Yingchen’s golden core is so beautiful, just as bright and pure as she is, QAQ.]
 

 
[I want to buy Golden Core merchandise!]
 

 
[Shao, you bastard! Also, to the person who wants to buy the heroine's golden core merchandise, you successfully made me hold back my tears.]
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s golden core was shattered, and Shao Xuanzheng gleefully recounted how much he had endured her arrogance and pride over the years, and how he finally didn’t have to bear it anymore. Mu Yingchen just looked at him quietly, her beautiful face even paler than when she was in the freezing wasteland, but her eyes were still cold and bright: “Your plan succeeded not because I was arrogant, not because you were more cunning than me, but because you were despicable and vile enough, while I never guarded against my own partner.”
 

 
In the special viewing section, several familiar film critics were whispering their thoughts: “No matter what kind of adversity she faces, we’ve never seen Tong Zhao’s subconscious give up. This seems to be a common trait in many of her characters.”
 

 
“That’s what makes her subconscious so likable.”
 

 
“These lines are quite emotional, unlike what Shi Qianqiu would write. It must have been an impromptu addition from Tong Zhao’s subconscious.”
 

 
They nodded in agreement.
 

 
As if responding to the critics' words, the following scenes showed the fairy, who had been so perfectly portrayed in the first fifteen minutes, having her wings broken, pressed into the cold river, her soft black hair disheveled, and her once-pure white robe stained with blood, now in tatters.
 

 
The contrast was devastating.
 

 
Mu Yingchen, once so proud and clean, had been completely humiliated and used up by her lover.
 

 
The previously lively fans of Tong Zhao in the comment section went silent halfway through, while those who weren’t quiet were passionately cursing Shao Xuanzheng. Casual viewers, feeling sorry for the heroine’s plight, started discussing off-topic matters—what kind of person would Chen Zhuzhi be in real life to play such a despicable role?
 

 
The comment section then erupted with a round of gossip about Chen Zhuzhi’s controversies.
 

 
The first mini-climax of the first half came when Mu Yingchen, barely recovering from her serious injuries, cut off her own left hand in order to escape.
 

 
How painful must that have been!
 

 
But her face showed almost no expression, so calm it didn’t seem like she was cutting off her own hand.
 

 
Thus, everyone assumed Tong Zhao had the pain immunity mode on.
 

 
However, with the pain immunity fully activated, there would be logical inconsistencies, and the actors in the scene would sense something was off, so it wasn’t 100% pain immunity.
 

 
[Even at the maximum of 70%, it must still hurt a lot. Tong Zhao’s subconscious is truly resilient. Remember last time when she removed a bullet from her thigh wound? If there’s a big-budget action movie, they should definitely consider our girl.]
 

 
[No, no, no, no, please no. Just make some art films. It breaks my heart to see my wife getting hurt!]
 

 
After the heroine escaped, she stumbled upon the Li family caravan heading up the mountain.
 

 
This is a common trope in movies: first showing the protagonist in a pitiful and downtrodden state, while the villains appear glamorous and powerful. It’s a classic formula that the audience understands, but it still effectively stirs emotions. People want to see the protagonist turn the tables and get revenge, eagerly awaiting what’s next. But...
 

 
Renowned film critic Chen Shiyun sighed, “This girl really has an amazing presence. She’s so captivating. Even when she’s in rags, leaning against a tree in the dark, taking up only a small corner of the frame, I still can’t help but focus on her.”
 

 
The female critic next to him gave him a sidelong glance.
 

 
During the pre-screening event earlier, Chen Shiyun had been eagerly chatting with Tong Zhao, even exchanging WeChat contacts with her. After she left, he looked completely smitten, like he had fallen head over heels in love. She whispered to another female critic, “This must be what men are like.”
 

 
However, she had to admit that Tong Zhao had indeed captured seventy percent of her attention just now.
 

 
Even though Ding Jiao, who played Li Qiaoqiao, was dressed in exquisite clothes with numerous maids and servants around her, she still didn’t have that commanding presence. If there were points to be deducted from “Heartless Tribulation”, they would start with how it failed to suppress Tong Zhao’s presence.
 

 
But was that Ding Jiao’s fault for not being captivating enough, or was it Tong Zhao’s subconscious being too compelling?
 

 
It could only be said that competing on the same stage with such a "monster" is a kind of torment.
 

 
It seems that whether on or off screen, Ding Jiao could only serve as a foil to Tong Zhao...
 

 
The female critic who favored Ding Jiao sighed inwardly while giving Tong Zhao even higher marks in her notes.
 

 
The earlier scenes focused mostly on dialogue, and one critic remarked, “The opening showed the heroine practicing swordsmanship. Will there be action scenes showcasing her skills next? Or will it be purely magical combat? Shi Qianqiu’s films always involve a wave of expensive special effects.”
 

 
“That would be a waste of Tong Zhao’s subconscious,” another critic replied. “I fell in love with her because of ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’.”
 

 
“Haha, her action scenes in that movie were really impressive.”
 

 
Film critics are more sensitive to visual information than the average audience, and they tend to watch with a more detached mindset.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen discovered the woman locked up in the hunter’s cabin, many in the audience gasped, expecting the protagonist to unleash her power and rescue her. Tong Zhao’s subconscious was so calm and composed that it made the audience temporarily forget her dire situation—that she was currently a shattered Golden Core cultivator, with barely any spiritual power left and one hand severed.
 

 
“Oh? Instead of meeting a powerful ally, the protagonist encounters someone even weaker.” A critic expressed interest in Shi Qianqiu’s plot arrangement.
 

 
Male critics began discussing this point.
 

 
Meanwhile, the female critics, after exchanging opinions, found that they all liked this development.
 

 
Who needs a powerful ally?
 

 
Having Tong Zhao solo the entire scene is more than enough!
 

 
When Qingniang insisted that this “strange woman” was sure to save her, and Mu Yingchen reluctantly replied, “Alright, maybe you’re right,” the audience burst into small bursts of knowing laughter. The screen was filled with comments like [She really did it]—
 

 
Immediately afterward, Tong Zhao delivered a beautifully choreographed fight scene, drawing the audience, who had briefly relaxed, back into a state of tense focus.
 

 
[Another movie without a single dull moment.]
 

 
[Is this how one goes from an extra to a supporting role? Tong Zhao really took her on as an apprentice!]
 

 
[Damn, I’m so jealous of Qingniang. I want to be her apprentice too!]
 

 
After the initial satisfaction, the audience began repeating the call to become her apprentice.
 

 
Who wouldn’t want such a beautiful and powerful master?
 

 
By now, the main storyline of the movie had become very clear.
 

 
Compared to the female lead’s journey to find the divine sword and seek revenge, Shao Xuanzheng’s scenes were far less engaging. The director begrudgingly provided only some brief explanatory shots. Fans of Chen Zhuzhi were angrily criticizing Shi Qianqiu’s brutal editing for marginalizing their beloved actor, but their complaints were quickly drowned out by the mainstream voices.
 

 
Who cares about the scumbag's debauchery? The audience wanted to see more interactions between Mu Yingchen and her disciple.
 

 
In the first half-hour, the audience was introduced to Mu Yingchen’s ethereal, otherworldly side.
 

 
In the following half-hour, the audience gradually got to know her warm and endearing side... Actually, the Immortal Master wasn’t being cute, it was just her interactions with her disciple that were adorable. It was a classic “Clueless and Grumpy” duo that the audience fell for without even realizing it.
 

 
[Immortal Master: I’m fasting, but my disciple’s grilled fish? Hand it over.]
 

 
[Immortal Master, just spoil her already!]
 

 
[The orange dynamic is set, let the scumbag die quickly.]
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is certainly not a yuri film, and the director didn’t mislead the audience. It was made very clear that Qingniang’s feelings for her master are purely admiration and trust, transcending romantic love—a steadfast choice...
 

 
And that makes it even more shippable!
 

 
What's the point of shipping an official CP? It’s the ones that are explicitly denied that are the most fun to ship.
 

 
Tong Zhao has worked with the "big wolf dog" Song Wanzhuo and played a couple with the "little puppy" Tang Jingjie, but neither CP made much of a splash. After filming, the hype faded away quickly. No one expected that later on, this master-disciple pair would become Tong Zhao's most prolific and popular fan-created CP.
 

 
Back to the film.
 

 
When the disciple was about to sacrifice herself to the furnace, an orange-colored comment shot across the screen—
 

 
[The master-disciple CP is real! Mom, I’m shipping it for real!]
 

 
The discussion was still mostly about the plot.
 

 
[Qingniang hates being used so much, but she’s willing to let her master use her...]
 

 
[No, little disciple, don’t die! Are there any Shi Qianqiu fans here? He wouldn’t be so cruel, right?]
 

 
[Don’t get your hopes up about Shi the Scoundrel’s conscience. He’s a disciple of Gen Urobuchi.]
 

 
[Urobuchi, put down that pen!!]
 

 
Mu Yingchen, on her journey to find the divine sword with her little disciple, was far more relaxed and happy than during her dual cultivation period with Shao Xuanzheng. The sweetness in the middle was so intense that the audience didn’t realize there were blades hidden in the candy until now, leaving them unexpectedly chewing on shards of glass, mouths bleeding, and tears falling.
 

 
Xu Xiaoheng, who played the little disciple, had tears in her eyes.
 

 
She glanced surreptitiously at Tong Zhao...
 

 
Off-screen, Tong Zhao sat upright, her heavily made-up face showing no emotion. There was no hint of distraction, only contemplation. Xu Xiaoheng felt a bit disheartened as she looked away, thinking that Tong Zhao truly lived up to her superstar status, remaining unaffected by the emotions in the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Didn’t expect it—Immortal Lu is a potential lesbian heartbreaker too.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [“Thank you, luckily I’m very straightforward.”]
 

 
Tong Zhao watched the movie she starred in with the same mindset as an esports player reviewing match footage—purely analytical, unaffected by the memories and emotions involved.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen pinned her disciple down and leaped into the roaring sword furnace, the comments were filled with shock and tears.
 

 
There were also some out-of-place comments:
 

 
[“Jojo, I’m not human anymore!”]
 

 
[“...Refund my tears!”]
 

 
[“I beg the brothers in front of me, crying and laughing really looks insane.”]
 

 
At this point, "Heartless Tribulation" officially entered the thrilling segment of continuous climaxes. Clichéd, as it may be, executing it well, isn’t easy; audiences need to feel satisfied for the box office to do well. The director stopped toying with the audience, generously granting the protagonist a powerful boost, allowing her to make a grand comeback.
 

 
The pacing from setup to explosion was handled perfectly by the director.
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s subconscious has an advantage; her comebacks are always satisfying. Even a director with basic aesthetics can edit them well,” said one film critic.
 

 
“Exactly, Tong Zhao’s scene here,” one critic who preferred domestic animation recalled an older traditional film: “It reminds me of the climax in ‘White Snake’ when Sun Wukong breaks his seal due to Jiang Liuer’s death, igniting with red light—a moment that, if captured well, would be memorable and exhilarating.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s astonishing sword strike reduced Shao Xuanzheng to ashes.
 

 
In the end, the scumbag was left with nothing.
 

 
...
 

 
After the movie concluded, thunderous applause erupted in the venue.
 

 
The lights gradually brightened, and the list of creators began to roll. Below, Chen Zhuzhi found his name in the cast section, his fist clenched so tightly he nearly broke his fake smile. Next came the interview and Q&A segment, with the crew heading to the designated press area. After this, there would be an after-party exclusively for special guests...
 

 
Of course, this would be a gathering for various bigwigs and critics, heavily imbued with socializing and networking.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked her, “I edited it well, right?”
 

 
“It’s good,” Tong Zhao acknowledged, “especially that opening segment; I can’t believe you managed to cut it so emotionally.”
 

 
“I added a million little details.”
 

 
They spoke in hushed tones under the excited camera flashes, like two artists discussing the beautiful scenes of a film. Many of the positive reports from this premiere featured that candid shot.
 

 
The audience applauded more enthusiastically to invite the crew members on stage.
 

 
The main cast of "Heartless Tribulation" was quite small, primarily thanks to Shi Qianqiu, who served as producer, investor, screenwriter, and director all in one, thereby consolidating several key roles and simplifying things.
 

 
The order of questions had already been arranged.
 

 
After the screening, the online audience dispersed as well.
 

 
They might remain immersed in the excitement of the film for a while, sharing their thoughts on social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and various forums. However, that was a matter for public relations and marketing companies to monitor. Only the more dedicated fans and actor supporters stayed for the interview segment.
 

 
The first questions were posed by well-known authoritative media outlets, and the queries were quite standard.
 

 
“First of all, congratulations on making such an excellent film,” the reporter said formulaically before continuing, “I understand that ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was originally an experimental film with two protagonists. Such a large production for an experiment could only be achieved by Director Shi. So why did it end up becoming a single-protagonist film?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s smile gradually faded.
 

 
“I’m very fair,”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied with a smile. “Whoever performs well gets to be the protagonist; if she can steal the show, that’s her talent. I truly didn’t expect her to excel to the point of exhibiting overwhelming dominance… The final cut of the film is essentially a single-protagonist movie; adding anyone else wouldn’t fit.”
 

 
A reporter, sensing a point of contention, asked, “Is Tong Zhao’s performance significantly better than Chen Zhuzhi’s? What does the actress herself think?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, “The result is right there in the movie; you all saw it just now.”
 

 
Why even ask?
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi felt a murderous urge rising within him.
 

 
However, he didn’t dare contradict Shi Qianqiu and could only respond stiffly, “Of course, I’m willing to cooperate with the director’s arrangements.”
 

 
The reporter then asked a few questions about box office predictions and marketing plans, which made the fans feel drowsy until the second half, when the questions started to get a bit more interesting—
 

 
“As of today, Tong Zhao, your performances in ‘Ming Emperor,’ ‘72 Hours,’ and ‘Sea King Kill’ have shown a lot of variation in your subconscious. There has been much speculation from the outside; how do you think you accomplished this? Is it really due to having triplets?” The reporter ended with a joke.
 

 
The audience watching the interview livestream perked up.
 

 
Great question!
 

 
This was the issue they were most concerned about!
 

 
“First of all, I can assure you that I am an only child,”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed, showing her calm and cheerful side as always in front of the camera. “I’ve gone through many changes during my growth process, and I’ve had very different thoughts at different stages. The differences are so stark that they seem like they wouldn’t appear in the same person. Before entering the holographic chamber, I would immerse myself in the mindset of that period, which is why it looks so special. Of course, they are all me.”
 

 
As she finished, her slightly curved eyes sparkled with gentle smiles.
 

 
Tong Zhao loves herself too much.
 

 
[Beauty fans are fully satisfied!]
 

 
[Ahhh, my wife is smiling at me! Where’s the best place to buy a house in the school district?]
 

 
[Whether she’s the cold and aloof fairy or the private Tong Zhao, I want them all!]
 

 
Tong Zhao, professionally exuding her glamorous aura, had an extremely strong presence, but her usual demeanor was a bit more reserved than concubine Chen’s and not as sharp and cold as Lu Xianchang’s. Overall, she was more warm and worldly, making her more acceptable to mainstream audiences.
 

 
The reporter, subconsciously influenced by her aura, ended up focusing more on her despite the intention to share the spotlight evenly.
 

 
Ding Jiao’s fans were about to complain about the bias when they noticed how their younger sister looked at Tong Zhao…
 

 
The orange forces were in trouble!
 

 
“Director Shi has a habit of making things difficult for actors. I’ve heard that Tong Zhao is the director’s favorite instinctive actor? Did anything interesting happen during your collaboration?”
 

 
“Make things difficult for actors?” Shi Qianqiu asked, puzzled, turning to look at the other crew members. “Did I? I don’t think so. But Tong Zhao is indeed my favorite actor; her subconscious is very creative—she’s the most unique one I’ve ever seen.”
 

 
“We won’t compare with the tweezers and bullet clips!”
 

 
This cross-regional interaction not only had netizens laughing out loud but also sparked interest in the film.
 

 
The news about “Heartless Tribulation” causing many female actors to return home empty-handed was a long time ago. With He Duoduo mentioning it here and marketing accounts reposting it, netizens began to reminisce—miraculously, there was no situation of disparaging each other; instead, they could only exclaim that Tong Zhao’s subconscious was too powerful and feminine.
 

 
[If you want to compete with Tong Zhao, you have to go to the male actor circle.]
 

 
[The hard male actors in domestic entertainment all have uncle vibes; why not go to foreign entertainment to compete?]
 

 
[Support my sister in breaking out of Asia and bringing glory to the country! /doge /doge]
 

 
These joking comments shifted netizens’ and fans’ attention to just how powerful Tong Zhao really was.
 

 
After one content creator compiled all of Tong Zhao’s action scenes, the view count skyrocketed, landing it in the top three of the film and television section on Bilibili. After watching, netizens couldn’t help but fall into deep contemplation.
 

 
Is this the same person who danced the jumping jingling dance, single-handedly battled an army of zombies, and after severing her left hand, still managed to take down the scumbag?
 

 
Is it really the same person?
 

 
The edited video, along with Tong Zhao’s interview after the premiere of “Heartless Tribulation,” explained this phenomenon.
 

 
Netizens started to wonder what major changes Tong Zhao had experienced in her life.
 

 
Since she rarely talked about her past experiences, they began to fill in the gaps with grandiose imaginings based on her distinctive subconscious—
 

 
The imperial concubine always gets what she wants.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have had a rich romantic history; she’s an old sea king.
 

 
Feng Yanqi is decisive and incredibly cool.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have great leadership skills; she was probably the boss back in school.
 

 
Mu Yingchen has an ethereal quality, completely detached from the mortal world.
 

 
Perhaps one day Tong Zhao will hold a press conference to announce that she’s going to inherit her family’s Taoist temple.
 

 
As the speculation became increasingly absurd, netizens envisioned Tong Zhao as having had a tumultuous and extraordinary first half of her life.
 

 
[Ah, I really want to be childhood friends with Sister Zhao; her life must be amazing!]
 

 
...
 

 
Xu Zhu, who grew up with Tong Zhao, felt very confused.
 

 
Wasn’t she just an ordinary rich girl?
 

 
Romantic experiences? She hasn’t even dated!
 

 
Leadership skills? Tong Zhao doesn’t even participate in clubs!
 

 
Xu Zhu also knew very well that the Tong family didn’t have a Taoist temple to inherit.
 

 
What a tumultuous first half of life!
 

 
However, with the immense popularity of “Heartless Tribulation,” netizens’ curiosity continued to grow. The discussion remained heated, and they finally managed to uncover some clues about her background through Tong Zhao’s old classmates…
# Chapter60
No wall cannot be broken through in this world.
 

 
If there is, it must be because the previous hammering wasn't forceful enough.
 

 
And this time, "Heartless Tribulation" is so hot that the curiosity of netizens about its sole protagonist, Tong Zhao, is like a giant iron hammer, constantly pounding away with "Eighty!" "Eighty!" until it finally breaks through the wall.
 

 
Just how popular is "Heartless Tribulation"?
 

 
On its opening day, it raked in 183 million yuan, contributing nearly ninety percent of the total box office for that day. Other films released around the same time were pitifully compared to it, and the entire industry knew that Shi Qianqiu was about to produce another phenomenal work.
 

 
It's infuriating how people can make you feel inadequate!
 

 
New directors fear nothing more than investors losing faith in them.
 

 
Shi, coming from a wealthy background, had plenty of opportunities to try and fail, and his innate talent helped him soar once he got going.
 

 
So while his peers were envious of him, they wouldn’t lose their composure; they could only sigh at how lucky he was.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" took years to finally start filming, and it truly allowed him to meet Tong Zhao, who delivered an unparalleled and outstanding performance, creating an unforgettable Mu Yingchen for the audience. It’s hard to say whether it was his keen eye for talent or just pure luck. With the year-end Best Instinct Film Awards approaching, nominations were guaranteed, and one could anticipate wins for Best Modeling and Best Actress—just thinking about it made one envious.
 

 
As for the Best Modeling Award…
 

 
There’s no helping it; the budget is what it is.
 

 
The modeling rental fees for many grand scenes in "Heartless Tribulation" weren’t cheap, let alone original constructions—all the funding was going up in flames.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was particularly generous with his spending.
 

 
Meanwhile, films with similar themes have seen a slight uptick in box office earnings due to its influence—
 

 
Although most new reviews criticize them for being far inferior to "Heartless Tribulation," it's still enjoyable to eat alongside the big brother.
 

 
Making money isn’t embarrassing.
 

 
…
 

 
"Recent Major Film's Female Lead Background Revealed"
 

 
“Wait, are the two actresses in 'Countdown 72 Hours' actually good friends? They don’t look like it!”
 

 
“TZ and XZ have been good friends from middle school to high school, and there are solid photos to prove it.”
 

 
…
 

 
Among the trending topics on Weibo is a high school photo of Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu.
 

 
In the photo, the two girls are not wearing any makeup and have innocent looks on their faces.
 

 
Even without makeup, it’s clear that the girl on the right with flowing long hair is Tong Zhao. She has prominent features; her three-dimensional facial structure has already blossomed into a beauty that could withstand the test of the big screen. Her bright, curved eyes and radiant smile make her look carefree.
 

 
In comparison, Xu Zhu, standing to her left, appears somewhat indistinct.
 

 
The backdrop of the photo features a well-manicured lawn, and the source claims this is a corner of an expensive private school.
 

 
Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao are both female, so even if they were old acquaintances, it wouldn't be big news.
 

 
The issue arises from their past collaboration.
 

 
During the filming of “Countdown 72 Hours,” the relationship they portrayed on and off-screen was very cold, with zero interaction during promotional events. In the movie, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, also treats her older sister Feng Yanqi poorly.
 

 
However, the newly revealed photo shows the two holding hands, looking like a pair of good friends.
 

 
The informant also stated that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu were inseparable good sisters.
 

 
They even took the same private car to and from school.
 

 
Tong Zhao is from a wealthy family, but there’s no information about Xu Zhu’s family; she hasn’t mentioned it.
 

 
With the photo as proof, the credibility of this anonymous tip has greatly increased. Riding on the film's success and Tong Zhao’s own popularity, discussions among netizens began to surge.
 

 
Excited fans of Xu Zhu jumped in:
 

 
[Little sister is indeed a princess raised with love.]
 

 
[Wow, this school is obviously expensive; she’s definitely a child who can go home to inherit the family business if she doesn’t work hard on her dancing.]
 

 
[The beautiful sister's friend is a fairy sister; I'm in awe.]
 

 
Compared to the excitement of Xu Zhu's fans, Tong Zhao's fans focused more on seeing old photos of their idol.
 

 
[The only good thing about this photo leak is that it proves Tong Zhao's natural beauty; she hasn't had any plastic surgery.]
 

 
[Friendships from school days don’t mean much; let’s just wait patiently for Sister Zhao to speak up.]
 

 
Since Xu Zhu debuted in “Star Selection Girls,” she hasn’t made much of a splash aside from a poorly received apocalyptic film. Under Tong Zhenming's connections, she managed to land the leading role in a drama, but unfortunately, it received a lukewarm response after airing. In contrast, whatever Tong Zhao stars in becomes a hit, and “Heartless Tribulation” catapulted her, albeit temporarily, to the status of box office goddess; she just needs one more movie to maintain her position.
 

 
In terms of status, popularity, and the allure of subconscious charm, the two are not on the same level.
 

 
Unless the main person initiates interaction, Tong Zhao’s fans would definitely not like to see their idol being overshadowed by a talent show contestant trying to ride the wave of popularity.
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans, on the other hand, saw it differently.
 

 
They believed that as long as they remained polite, it would definitely be a positive interaction since their sister wouldn’t lose anything.
 

 
Meanwhile, those who truly understood the relationship between the two, particularly in the second-generation circle, especially the WeChat group of Zeshan Company—
 

 
Second Generation C: [Weibo Link]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Ah, this]
 

 
Second Generation B: [Ah, this 1]
 

 
Second Generation D: [Where's Tong Zhao? Quickly @ Tong Zhao, we can't let this white lotus ride the wave of popularity!]
 

 
Since Tong Zhao hadn’t shown up, they were muttering among themselves, waiting to understand her stance before publicly expressing their support. Clearly, the old man from the Tong family was in the wrong; this was not handled properly. They were professional rich kids, often getting into trouble and having one or two cards cut off by their families, relying only on their five-figure “meager” allowances and friends to survive until their elders cooled down.
 

 
That was called getting lectured by their parents.
 

 
But what about Tong Zhao’s family?
 

 
It was clearly bullying their sister Zhao to death, wanting to elevate the mistress's pair of children.
 

 
Just after finishing a grueling body practice and covered in sweat, Tong Zhao walked out of the bathroom and received a call from her agent: “You and Xu Zhu are good sisters? Why didn't you tell me?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
That term “good sisters” was a shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a big sip of mineral water: “Good thing I hadn’t eaten; otherwise, I’d be sick.”
 

 
“What’s going on?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't like to talk about her family matters. It was impossible for her to voluntarily share her sob story; knowing her current self was enough, and there was no need to be overly curious about her past. However, since Sister Chu asked, there had to be a reason behind it, so she briefly explained her background as concisely as possible: “She’s my half-sister.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “!!!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Xu Zhu's mom used to be my mom’s subordinate and close friend. My mom considered her a true friend. During her pregnancy, she secretly climbed into my dad’s bed and ended up pregnant with Xu Zhu. So, we’re very close in age, essentially blooming from both ends. My mom thought she was tricked by a scumbag and got pregnant out of wedlock, so she took care of her in various ways and even later moved in with us.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “???"
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Later, my mom passed away. The mistress successfully gave birth to a son and fulfilled my dad’s dream of continuing the family line. After she moved in, I had a fight with him and severed our father-daughter relationship, then moved out. The subsequent events fast-forwarded to me acting in 'The Legend of Ming Emperor.'”
 

 
The amount of information was overwhelming, and Sister Chu felt a bit dizzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao's tone was so calm, as if she were talking about someone else.
 

 
But upon reflection, it was indeed a tumultuous tale of love and hate that shattered one's worldview.
 

 
“Then why did you take on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’…”
 

 
It must have been difficult to perform alongside her enemy's daughter. Sister Chu felt a sympathetic affection for the girl.
 

 
However, the sympathy lasted no more than three seconds before the young girl countered, “What’s there to not take on? At that time, it was a great resource for me, and besides, it should be her who can’t face me; I have nothing to hide from her.”
 

 
She had thought it through too clearly.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu has always wanted to compete with her.
 

 
Competing for the title of “daughter of Tong Zhenming,” competing for the image of a “rich beauty,” and competing for the public's affection.
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it and realized this was indeed the case.
 

 
So she summarized what had happened online: “I’m here to clarify your stance; as good as it sounds, the company doesn’t want you to get involved with her. It’s best to distance yourself a bit; otherwise, you’ll lose your prestige.”
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and opened her WeChat page, where she saw messages of concern from her friends.
 

 
Wei Zekai exploded in the group chat.
 

 
Boss Kai: [I want to confront her! @Tong Zhao]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, come out, I can’t hold it in anymore, I really want to curse that girl]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, we have group photos too, can I post two?]
 

 
Wei Zekai was so angry.
 

 
His relationship with Tong Zhao was so solid.
 

 
Then he woke up to see that, well, Xu Zhu had become Tong Zhao’s best friend.
 

 
This was more than just the house collapsing; it was like being robbed!
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. Did he not understand the situation? He was even jealous of Xu Zhu: [Go ahead and post.]
 

 
She thought for a moment: [Let them curse; I’m not planning to give her any face.]
 

 
After telling her friends, she expressed to Sister Chu: “I don’t want everyone to pay too much attention to my private affairs. Xu Zhu shouldn’t want to stir up sisterhood for attention either; she’s more anxious than I am, afraid I’ll expose her dirty laundry.”
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it too.
 

 
Xu Zhu had created an image of a rich and beautiful princess for herself. If her fans found out her mom was a mistress, her persona would collapse, and her fans would scatter: “But dealing with this kind of rich family matter... it’s not very appropriate for either the company or you to bring it up; it feels a bit low-class.”
 

 
“No,”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked slightly: “I’ll just go along with it; someone wants to vent for me.”
 

 
“Who?” After asking, Sister Chu recalled a name: “Wei Zekai? Or Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
“Not just Wei Zekai, but some other friends too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao casually mentioned a list of flashy second-generation names that exuded a "smell of copper": "Why bring up Director Shi? I'm not familiar with him. Don’t be fooled by him praising me everywhere; in private, he doesn't even like my posts in our social circles. It's the purest colleague relationship."
 

 
"As long as it's not him, but you still have your CP super topic with Director Shi," her manager teased her. "With that tone you just used, I thought Xu Zhu was going to cut off a couple of her arms."
 

 
...
 

 
Time was precious, and they stopped chatting about personal matters. Sister Chu hung up the phone to align the company's public relations stance, while Tong Zhao dried her hair, played with her phone, and scrolled through Weibo and WeChat to observe the situation.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Zhu was also feeling anxious.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously blacklisted her, and she had cut ties with any mutual friends who kept in touch with Xu Zhu; it was quite definitive. Xu Zhu really didn't dare to rely on her fame; it was just that once someone becomes famous, their past is bound to be dug up, catching her off guard.
 

 
Xu Zhu had a lot she wanted to say to Tong Zhao.
 

 
— You’re in a rising phase now; exposing this kind of information, even if you’re the victim, will affect your image.
 

 
— Is it really good to drag family into this? Your mother just passed away not long ago; if this gets out, many people will definitely talk about her.
 

 
— Tong Zhao, your movie has been successful again. You've already achieved everything; can we just pretend we never knew each other?
 

 
It was useless; Tong Zhao simply didn’t answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.
 

 
Xu Zhu now just wanted to find out who leaked the information and give them a good beating.
 

 
Xu Zhu opened Weibo.
 

 
So far, no one had mentioned her background. She had a strong sense of pride; her old classmates didn’t know what her family did, and since they saw her lifestyle was high-end, they thought she was from the same social class. Weibo was calm, with Tong Zhao's fans not particularly liking her, but they hadn’t escalated the situation, as if it were the calm before a storm.
 

 
She clicked on the group photo.
 

 
After a moment of thought, Xu Zhu remembered what they had been doing back then.
 

 
Right, at that time, Tong Zhao had been taking tennis lessons with her, and afterward, they asked a passing classmate to help them take a hand-holding photo on the lawn... Tong Zhao looked better than her, so she didn’t particularly like to be in the same frame with her, but on that day, perhaps because the weather was too nice, the dopamine released from intense exercise influenced her, making her inexplicably want a photo together.
 

 
In the picture, the two of them really looked like they were very close.
 

 
Xu Zhu irritably put down her phone.
 

 
The gossip about "good sisters" wasn’t that interesting; just as netizens were about to lose interest, a major influencer suddenly compiled a collection of posts by the second-generation rich, with Wei Zekai leading the way—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [@Star Selection Girl Xu Zhu, stay away from my brother.]
 

 
Second-Gen A: [Ordinary good sisters share food, jewelry, and daily life, but sister Zhu’s good sisters share about her dad.]
 

 
Second-Gen B: [sister Zhu really knows how to play the role of the rich beauty; her mother can charm a man into kicking his eldest daughter out and cutting off her financial support. The mistress who climbs to the top is forever a goddess!]
 

 
Second-Gen C: [The three-year period is up; as for the Tong family, it’s fine to let them go! Let us at Zeshan Company welcome Boss Zhao back to her rightful place—]
 

 
The rich second-generation crowd didn't engage in the entertainment industry's superficial politeness; they were sarcastic and even tagged people directly, not afraid of escalating the situation, which kept netizens’ minds busy as they realized it had turned into a wealthy family feud!
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans were confused.
 

 
What did it mean for a mistress to rise to power and for a bird to take over another’s nest?
 

 
Some younger fans were upset and questioned them in the comments, but the second-generation crowd didn’t care; the more they fought back, the more dirt came to light.
 

 
Since much of the information emerged from nested comments, it was somewhat disorganized. By the end of the afternoon, a representative had compiled a timeline that clarified the relationship between Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao, even uncovering the company and connections behind the Tong family—
 

 
Goodness, they were actually one of the main investors in "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
Many viewers who followed this season’s talent show were fans of other contestants and had their own suspicions about who seemed pre-determined to debut; Xu Zhu was one of those "chosen ones," but her singing and dancing skills were merely acceptable and hadn't been scrutinized deeply.
 

 
Once this was uncovered...
 

 
The dirt had been dug up, causing some upper-ranking contestants who didn’t qualify for debut to feel indignant.
 

 
If this information had been revealed earlier, it might have opened up a spot for their younger sister.
 

 
Unfortunately, there were no "what ifs" in this world.
 

 
The only way to vent their frustration was to lash out at Xu Zhu.
 

 
The audience of "Star Selection Girl" began to recount the details Xu Zhu had previously crafted for her "rich princess" persona, realizing it had all been a façade.
 

 
Some fans didn’t believe it.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu seemed very at ease and natural when using expensive skincare products and designer handbags; she didn’t seem like a nouveau riche.
 

 
A rich second-generation individual responded to this argument from fans: [Of course she seems natural because Tong Zhao's mother treated her like the daughter of a good friend, buying double of everything so they could use it together. She’s gotten used to leeching off that, sucking blood like a vampire, and she continues to do so.]
 

 
[Hahaha, you can tell they’re a seasoned player with that comment.]
 

 
[Uh, actually, Tong Zhao’s mom seems a bit foolish, right? Didn’t she notice the signs? It’s quite remarkable that a dumpling could raise someone like Tong Zhao with such subconscious traits.]
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao had never brought this up on her own, as she didn’t want people discussing her mother.
 

 
In her dark, single apartment, she curled up on the soft couch, with only the light from her phone illuminating the space.
 

 
Her WeChat group was discussing her situation.
 

 
Whenever she wanted, she could join the discussion and accept her friends' comfort.
 

 
They all felt indignant on her behalf and were heartbroken for her… Compared to her past life, she truly had so much more in this one.
 

 
After watching for a while, she still chose to speak to the persona in her mind: [My mom is indeed a bit foolish.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [She doesn’t have an eye for people.]
 

 
Han Zhi: 【But that doesn’t justify her friend’s husband betraying her.】
 

 
They all shared Tong Zhao’s perspective and saw some of the “self-inflicted” comments.
 

 
This victim-blaming theory was just a small portion of the voices.
 

 
[I was also quite foolish back then,]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was restrained and detached, as if she were talking about someone else, but it gradually lowered: [I won’t be foolish anymore. I won’t be foolish again.]
 

 
Tong Zhao saw a netizen saying that her mother's foolishness harmed her and chuckled lightly: [According to the logic of “mother’s debt is repaid by the daughter,” I won’t let go of anyone who has hurt her. She is responsible for being foolish and falling for tricks; I am responsible for slapping faces and taking revenge. Sounds good.]
 

 
…
 

 
As the once-dirty secrets were laid bare in the sunlight, the beautifully packaged little princess revealed her true form.
 

 
Countless netizens and disappointed fans bombarded the phone lines of the entertainment company that Xu Zhu was signed to. She had truly become "famous," but it was a kind of fame akin to being burned by fire. The company tried to contact Tong Zhao's manager, but all they said was that the artist clearly refused to communicate. Xu Zhu also stated that everything they said was true.
 

 
With deep-seated grievances, how could there be any communication?
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
Everything is true.
 

 
With these four words posted, all possibilities for private negotiation from Xu Zhu's side were completely blocked.
 

 
The situation Xu Zhu faced was even more serious than that of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had a solid foundation and works, and when domestic violence erupted, it drove away a large number of fans while awakening a batch of confused minds. Xu Zhu, on the other hand, was a shallow-rooted contestant; if it weren’t for her wealthy background and connections, she would have been just a quickly-fading commodity from the moment she debuted. Now, with her carefully crafted persona collapsing, all the air she had been holding onto was gone.
 

 
That day, Xu Zhu returned home from the dormitory, unable to face the questions of the other members of "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
But that place couldn’t even be considered her home.
 

 
When the incident made headlines in entertainment news, Tong Zhenming returned, enraged after being met with strange looks from the company’s shareholders. He forbade her from dreaming of being a star again: “If you still want to acknowledge me as your father, then stay out of the spotlight and behave yourself at home! After wasting so much time and acting like a demon for so long, you should know that you’re not cut out for this.”
 

 
Xu Zhu lowered her head and remained silent.
 

 
Her silence was a sign of her unwillingness to admit guilt; Tong Zhenming wanted her to apologize.
 

 
“...I know I was wrong; I’m sorry.”
 

 
Xu Zhu's eyes turned red.
 

 
Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let her leave, pressing down on her shoulder: “What did you do wrong?”
 

 
In that moment, immense grievance exploded from Xu Zhu’s chest. She looked up and glared at her biological father with hatred: “I was wrong for competing with Tong Zhao. I can’t compete with her for what I want, and everything I’ve fought for is worthless!”
 

 
She shrank her shoulders, rushed back to her room, and slammed the door shut, ignoring her father’s attempts to pound on it.
 

 
The Tong family was still wealthy, and the door was solidly built.
 

 
Just when things were going wrong, Xu Zhu felt even more humiliated. Ning Zhiyi suggested they take a break from each other to cool off.
 

 
She felt numb.
 

 
The dream of becoming a star that she wanted to snatch away from Tong Zhao was never hers to take.
 

 
The two men she had managed to win over didn’t love her; they loved themselves and their interests.
 

 
Xu Zhu buried her face in the pillow and cried for a while. Once she calmed down, she gradually accepted the reality that she had to give up her dream of stardom. If she couldn’t surpass her stepsister, she might as well return to being a wealthy young lady. Netizens wouldn’t be able to do anything to her.
 

 
Maybe later she could apologize to Tong Zhenming in a soft tone, she thought.
 

 
At least she would still be a young lady, able to live the affluent life she had always wanted, the life a Tong family heiress should have.
 

 
Even though “Heartless Tribulation” had become a hit, the actors didn’t receive a share of the investment profits; Tong Zhao would only get her original salary, which was definitely less than making a business profit. Thinking of this, Xu Zhu felt a slight rise in her fondness for her father.
 

 
This man held grudges, couldn’t stand being defied by juniors, and it seemed that this time, she would have to kneel and admit her mistakes to return to being his “good daughter”…
 

 
However, Tong Zhenming wasn’t angry about her behavior this time.
 

 
He had a more urgent matter to deal with—
 

 
Three companies that had been collaborating with them suddenly announced they wouldn’t work with the Tong family anymore.
 

 
A product that brought in steady profits for the Tong family faced competition, significantly affecting cash flow. The management could no longer hide the situation after seeing the reports and had to report it upward.
 

 
Wasn’t everything going well?
 

 
Forget it; if it doesn’t work, they’ll just have to change partners. China is so big; finding clients isn’t that hard, right?
 

 
Tong Zhenming was shocked to realize that this was a premeditated and organized attack from several companies with strong momentum. Some were new companies, while others, previously struggling, suddenly had best-selling new products or incredibly profitable projects…
 

 
As for other local companies, as soon as they heard it was the Tong family, they were unwilling to wade into such muddy waters.
 

 
Tong Zhenming sent gifts and treated people to meals, only then learning about half of the truth behind the scenes.
 

 
The Wei family had only one young master, Wei Zekai.
 

 
No matter how useless he might be, everything would eventually be left to him.
 

 
Wei Zekai had posted ten Weibo messages cursing the illegitimate daughter and Tong Zhenming. Even if the Wei family hadn’t said anything, everyone tacitly acknowledged that the two families had fallen out.
 

 
Why would anyone risk offending the Wei family to help Tong Zhenming get through this crisis?
 

 
They weren’t foolish.
 

 
Unless there was a higher profit to be gained!
 

 
Given the high margins involved, it wouldn’t be impossible to cooperate.
 

 
The result was that if Tong Zhenming wanted to endure this situation, he would have to give up the vast majority of the profits.
 

 
“A bunch of capitalists sucking the marrow out of bones!”
 

 
He cursed bitterly, inadvertently including himself in the insult.
 

 
Tong Zhenming blamed everything on Wei Zekai, overlooking the other half of the truth.
 

 
During the same period, the second-generation wealthy individuals who voiced support for Tong Zhao on Weibo faced reprimands at home due to their low status. Their elders felt it was embarrassing for them to be in the news for cursing online, and they quickly cut off their financial support, wanting them to reflect on their actions and not offend people recklessly. They weren’t all from families as stable and prestigious as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
However, this time, the economic sanctions were ineffective.
 

 
Because those who had latched onto Tong Zhao, listened to her, and stirred up investment projects, the Ze Shan venture capital they had whimsically formed…
 

 
Actually made money.
 

 
Not only did they make money, but they also received dividends on the spot!
 

 
The second-generation individuals, driven purely by passion to support Tong Zhao, stared at the long string of zeros in their balances, alongside messages from their siblings on WeChat saying, “That so-called friend of yours? Now that she has no support from home, she’s just another girl hustling in the entertainment industry. Don’t let yourself be used without realizing it. Dad has frozen your card. You can borrow from other second-generations, but can you borrow from that female celebrity?”…
 

 
They truly didn’t know how to respond.
 

 
At the same time, in the Ze Shan venture capital shareholders' WeChat group.
 

 
Second Generation A: [Wait, weren’t we losing money together while doing charity?]
 

 
Second Generation C: [How could any project that my brother Kai invests in actually make money!?]
 

 
Boss Kai: [I'll give you all a chance to withdraw and reorganize your statements.]
 

 
When people are in extreme shock, they often speak their true feelings.
 

 
Among them, some had personally supervised the investment projects and had seen them improving, but Brother Kai's reputation for losing money was too strong. They were internally at ease, waiting for the day the project would collapse, never expecting to make a profit.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [As long as I'm here, we won't lose money.]
# Chapter61
After Ze Shan group was established, Tong Zhao invested in several projects that she believed would become popular.
 

 
Of course, her investments weren't made blindly.
 

 
What if the movies she produced unintentionally set off a butterfly effect?
 

 
To earn money in the long run, it's crucial to understand the underlying meaning behind investments. Many people lose money in stocks simply by following tips about stocks that are supposedly guaranteed to be profitable, only to jump in without understanding. They wait too long to sell, thinking they might make more, and end up losing it all.
 

 
Tong Zhao used her foresight to eagerly absorb various knowledge, filtering out reliable and sustainable projects that could be managed by Wei Zekai and his team. She was too busy with announcements to do anything other than make decisions, so she often delegated tasks.
 

 
She didn’t put all her eggs in one basket.
 

 
Even if a stock in her memory was set to soar, she only invested a portion.
 

 
The money she missed out on was part of her risk assessment; it didn’t count as a loss.
 

 
Second Generation A: "If I had known that 721 would skyrocket, I would have borrowed heavily to invest!"
 

 
Second Generation D: "I borrowed from the loan sharks!"
 

 
Boss Kai: "@Second Generation D, are you suggesting we give the loan sharks a run for their money?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Don’t treat missed profits as losses; focus on what you have."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll be responsible for figuring out how to expand our portfolio.”
 

 
Wei Zekai shared his grand ambitions in the group, and Tong Zhao casually chimed in, which had a greater impact on the members than even their own parents' advice.
 

 
It wasn’t solely about the money.
 

 
One major reason was the offline gathering where they decided to establish Ze Shan group. Tong Zhao had momentarily tapped into the spirit of a rally for a survival organization in a dystopian setting—she could have easily been a successful network marketer, inspiring these sheltered young heirs to work fervently for her.
 

 
Additionally, this was their first successful venture that yielded significant returns.
 

 
Their families had always doubted their intelligence, talent, and dedication, believing they weren't cut out for business. This group of second-generation heirs lacked nothing in terms of basic needs and always aimed for the best.
 

 
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, their pursuits revolved around socializing, respect, and self-actualization.
 

 
Tong Zhao managed to satisfy all three desires at once, making them willingly follow her.
 

 
While their earlier involvement had a playful aspect, the first round of profits genuinely astonished them. They collectively invested five million (mostly from Wei’s allowance, which he later topped up), and they had already recouped their investment. The total valuation of the projects they invested in reached eight figures… this part couldn’t be liquidated yet, but it was sustainable unless the companies bought back their shares at a high price.
 

 
Even if they intended to, Tong Zhao wouldn’t sell now.
 

 
She extended a helping hand during the companies' toughest times; she wasn’t there for charity. She planned to hold long-term and consider selling at the right moment to maximize profits.
 

 
The current profits looked impressive but were merely small gains compared to the ongoing potential.
 

 
It was like going back to "Sword Three" to speculate on limited-edition fashion—what seemed exaggerated at hundreds could later reach thousands.
 

 
Boss Kai: "Listen to my brother!”
 

 
Boss Kai: "By the way, bro, about the 'Excellent Companion Learning' project you tasked me with, Boss Chen has added a ton of details based on your instructions. We’re optimistic about this project, but we need more funding for promotion…"
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered.
 

 
The concept of companionship and training had only gained popularity in recent years, and it was still a blue ocean market.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’m very optimistic about this project. Keep investing, and let me know if you need more. It has to be executed well."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…I was just giving some suggestions, how did it turn into orders?"
 

 
At that moment, a colleague who had attended the meeting with Boss Chen jumped in to report—
 

 
Wei Zekai was serious about executing Tong Zhao's directives, turning the unseen strategist into an untouchable investment guru. After hearing about the "ton of details" from Wei, Boss Chen not only was brought back on track but also illuminated many profitable paths that others might not have seen. He had studied for a long time but hadn’t figured it out until now!
 

 
After all, some conclusions can only be reached through trial and error.
 

 
Boss Chen immediately regarded this strategist from Ze Shan as a remarkable figure, akin to Zhuge Liang.
 

 
Considering Wei’s age and background, this strategist must have been sent by the Wei family to safeguard their only son, conjuring an image of a well-dressed elder with well-maintained salt-and-pepper hair.
 

 
The same situation repeatedly occurred when the second-generation heirs went to oversee these companies.
 

 
They feared they weren’t authoritative enough.
 

 
After all, they were just following Sister Zhao’s lead.
 

 
But in the eyes of these smaller companies, they arrived with substantial investments, and every opinion they voiced was seen as highly enlightening… clearly, they were big shots! Young? Carrying documents? That meant their unseen backer was incredibly impressive!
 

 
Under the invisible pressure from strategist Tong Zhao, the finances of these companies dared not engage in any underhanded dealings.
 

 
Because of the profits, they didn’t even think about schemes to defraud investors or run away—
 

 
Why would someone who successfully started a business and is earning steadily want to flee?
 

 
Working for oneself is the true essence of being an employee!
 

 
If one were to delve a little deeper, Ze Shan group seemed almost like a mysterious cult.
 

 
What Tong Zhao said became their belief.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most devoted archbishop, holding the most practical resources.
 

 
The other second-generation heirs acted as bishops, working to develop followers.
 

 
Every company owner who received investment and guidance from Ze Shan became a devoted believer after seeing substantial profits.
 

 
The colleagues pieced together how the strategist was viewed by these smaller companies.
 

 
Whenever Ze Shan was mentioned, a wise, aged silhouette appeared in their minds—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I suspect there’s a problem here.JPG]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, I won't manage this for you; just make sure it’s done well.]
 

 
The second-generation heirs all promptly sent acknowledgment emojis, behaving obediently.
 

 
…
 

 
The "Good Sisters" controversy did not cease with Xu Zhu’s announcement of her withdrawal from the entertainment industry.
 

 
At first, audiences of "Star Selection Girl" suspected that Xu Zhu's debut was rigged, uncovering her connections and the Tong family. Tong Zhenming’s company was suddenly thrust into the public eye, and angry fans created a PR crisis for the company—friends who had helped arrange Xu Zhu’s debut no longer wanted to associate with him.
 

 
Netizens began to focus on what kind of life Tong Zhao had at home.
 

 
Dramatically, fans of "Heartless Tribulation" discovered the film's submitted documents.
 

 
Such documents are available for public scrutiny through the film association, completely transparent, but generally, only dedicated fans pay attention. The documents clearly stated whether lead actress Tong Zhao had applied for pain exemption.
 

 
…
 

 
"Shocking My Whole Family: Tong Zhao didn't apply for pain exemption in 'Heartless Tribulation'???"
 

 
The main post immediately garnered significant attention.
 

 
Similar screenshots circulated widely on Weibo.
 

 
Some netizens questioned why she would put herself through this, given that the memories recovered from the holographic chamber could be painfully distressing, potentially leaving psychological scars.
 

 
However, the top comment from a fan offered a different perspective: [Applying for pain exemption mainly serves to give the protagonist an advantage; after all, the subconscious has a natural tendency to seek benefit and avoid harm. Not having pain exemption could enhance the actor's performance, though it might affect realism.]
 

 
Even without pain exemption, Tong Zhao's subconscious was just as ruthless with herself.
 

 
A young fan advised Tong Zhao and her manager on Weibo to arrange for a psychologist for their sister, fearing she might have self-destructive tendencies.
 

 
Seeing this, Tong Zhao felt compelled to respond.
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV:
 

 
"My mental state is very healthy.
 

 
I'm used to pain and prefer not to apply for exemption, as it could affect my subconscious performance."
 

 
Tong Zhao managed her Weibo personally.
 

 
She felt it was impossible to make any inappropriate comments that could lead to her being blacklisted. She didn't want her fans to only see a Weibo filled with promotional ads and business selfies... While she couldn’t respond to everyone’s affection, she at least wanted the few ways fans could "connect" with her to feel more genuine.
 

 
Other than that, she had nothing more to say.
 

 
Public curiosity would never be satisfied.
 

 
To respond to everything was impractical—first, there was no time, and second, it would lower her status.
 

 
“I’ll just be myself; let them think what they want about the rest,” she told her manager.
 

 
“So confident,” Sister Chu said, giving her a thumbs-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, steering the conversation back to work: “Isn’t the next variety show about survival on a deserted island? Not applying for pain exemption could be used for publicity; if others do it, I won’t.”
 

 
Sister Chu glanced at Tong Zhao’s light-hearted Weibo post.
 

 
She then reflected on Tong Zhao's comment about using it for publicity, which had a very commercial flavor and felt quite grounded. She couldn’t help but feel a bit dazed: “That angle could indeed be expanded, but you’re only a guest for two days; we should first decide what major project to take next…”
 

 
Another director wanted her to audition.
 

 
Of course, given her current status, not everyone could afford her, but several prominent names still required Tong Zhao to be on her toes.
 

 
The conversations between stars and their managers remained unknown to the outside world.
 

 
Fans, on one hand, felt reassured knowing that their sister’s mental health was in good shape.
 

 
On the other hand, netizens focused on Tong Zhao's comment about being "used to pain."
 

 
What situation would lead someone to become accustomed to pain?
 

 
Considering the previously uncovered details about the Tong family, Tong Zhenming clearly didn’t care for his daughter and favored boys over girls.
 

 
Some netizens suggested that "Tong Zhao might have experienced domestic violence," which quickly gained many supporters—if she hadn’t been beaten growing up, how could she be so accustomed to pain?
 

 
To be fair, Tong Zhenming had never physically abused her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao excelled in her studies and was a source of pride for her father among peers. Other than the disappointment of not being a son to carry on the family name, she was already a very perfect daughter.
 

 
But why would Tong Zhao step up to defend him?
 

 
It was impossible; let the netizens speculate.
 

 
Emotional abuse is still abuse.
 

 
The psychological impact and torment inflicted by Tong Zhenming on her were far worse than a physical beating.
 

 
The reputations of Tong Zhenming and Xu Zhu as a dysfunctional father-daughter pair had soured. Xu Zhu had thought that by retreating from the industry, she could live quietly as a pampered young lady, but Tong Zhenming, disregarding her feelings, cut off her allowance, telling her to reflect on herself.
 

 
And this time, it wasn’t just her.
 

 
Xu’s mother, who had recently given birth to a son, also faced a downgrade in lifestyle.
 

 
Conflicts arose between mother and daughter; Xu's mother felt she shouldn’t argue with her father, as the whole family relied on him, while Xu Zhu believed her own mother didn’t see her as a person.
 

 
Without money, life became unbearable. She couldn’t go out shopping to vent and was stuck at home.
 

 
What entertainment was there at home?
 

 
Every time she logged onto Weibo, she was met with insults. Her account had been reclaimed by the company, which only became a platform for netizens and fans to criticize her, almost hoping to dig up a scandal. Fans who once treated her like a little princess were now expressing their disappointment in every word.
 

 
Xu Zhu felt that life had become incredibly difficult.
 

 
If she knew the truth behind this downgrade in lifestyle, it would be even more unbearable.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was no longer generous to his wife and daughter, not for their education, but because he genuinely had little liquidity left. He was already overwhelmed with work, scrambling for connections for the company, and now that people knew it was him, their attitudes shifted subtly.
 

 
Some old-school businessmen didn’t see it as a problem to be harsh with their children.
 

 
The issue was that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu, in terms of both appearance and achievement, were worlds apart.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's silence in the face of this slander was like stamping “fool” on his forehead.
 

 
A boss who discarded something precious for a trivial gain couldn’t possibly have good investment instincts.
 

 
Considering Tong Zhao's relationship with Wei Zekai, she might even end up being called Mrs. Wei in the future.
 

 
It wasn’t worth it for Tong Zhenming, marked as a fool, to offend the Wei family.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai repeatedly declared that Tong Zhao was his good brother, who could say for sure?
 

 
Moreover—
 

 
After Ze Shan group turned a profit, Wei Zekai returned home triumphantly, turning the family dinner into his performance review. As he talked enthusiastically, clearly and understandably, Wei’s father realized that he had made money, and quite a bit at that.
 

 
Here, “quite a bit” referred not to the amount but to the return on investment.
 

 
Once he finished, Wei’s father surprisingly praised him: “Well done! If you earn five more times, you can make up for your past losses.”
 

 
“……”
 

 
Damn.
 

 
The family didn't want to constrain the child and initially provided him with sufficient funds.
 

 
The losses were quite spectacular.
 

 
Wei Zekai pouted for a moment but quickly rallied, saying, "Don't worry, breaking even is just a small goal for now; in the future, I will lead Ze Shan to grow big and strong."
 

 
As he said this, he raised the corners of his mouth, his handsome face full of youthful vigor.
 

 
Seeing him take a big step from zero to one, the elders didn’t discourage him.
 

 
After dinner, Wei Father called him into the study.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit anxious; after all, he had often been scolded in the study. Every time there was a loss in investment, he would be lectured for two or three hours, and his father would end with, "Maybe you should just find a job."
 

 
Actually, Wei Father was hoping he would work at the family group.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai, having read too many web novels, panicked and thought his father wanted him to work on an assembly line at an electronics factory.
 

 
That time was a low point in his life.
 

 
Now, stepping into the study, he secretly encouraged himself—
 

 
He was making money.
 

 
He needed to be confident!
 

 
"Sit."
 

 
As soon as he walked in, Wei Father patted the sofa, motioning for him to sit down.
 

 
Once he obediently settled, his father got straight to the point: "How much of this was taught to you by someone else?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wei Father had navigated the business world for many years, and with only one son to watch over, it was easy to read Wei Zekai like an open book. When it came to feelings, though he claimed to see Tong Zhao as just a good brother, Wei Father could tell it was far from the truth.
 

 
But why remind his son?
 

 
After all, he had faced his own setbacks in love, and his son shouldn't be spared.
 

 
"About seventy percent," Wei Zekai admitted, realizing he couldn't hide it from his father. "The 'Little Lamb Playmate' project and those others were my responsibility. I didn't want to say too much at home; Tong Zhao asked me to organize the information and bring it back to discuss, saying it was to reassure you."
 

 
Tong Zhao.
 

 
Hearing that name again, Wei Father was a bit surprised.
 

 
In his mind, she was a woman so beautiful that it overshadowed other qualities.
 

 
"Then why didn't you mention her earlier?" Wei Father asked, a hint of displeasure in his tone.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew he had invested a lot of money in Ze Shan.
 

 
In terms of funding, he indeed held the major stake.
 

 
However, some of the precise and seasoned decisions mentioned earlier, along with the reporting approach, were definitely not his own ideas.
 

 
While it’s important to polish one’s own brand in business, taking too much credit is also a major taboo.
 

 
"I want to invite Tong Zhao over to play,"
 

 
Wei Zekai was puzzled: "After reviewing the materials and reports I organized, she polished them up and told me to remember my lines, saying not to mention her and just act like these ideas were all mine."
 

 
Wei Father understood; she was trying to make a good impression on him.
 

 
But since Xiao Kai was an only child, he had no motivation to compete with siblings...
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao's image in Wei Father's mind shifted from a particularly shrewd and beautiful woman to a girl who really liked his son. "You should treat her well, you fool."
 

 
He patted his son’s head.
 

 
After that lesson, he asked Wei Zekai to share his thoughts and questions about managing the company.
 

 
That night, after tucking himself in, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but message Tong Zhao on WeChat: [My dad thinks you’re really good to me.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Did Uncle find out? Well, it’s hard to keep anything from him.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I treat you well because you treat me well.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Moreover, my kindness isn’t blind; I believe you’re qualified to be my partner and have the talent to manage a company... I want to act, I enjoy acting, and I like leaving behind various works that showcase different sides of me. Hearing discussions about the characters I’ve played makes me happy. When my time is limited and I want everything, I can only collaborate with others.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [They are my partners, and you are my collaborator.]
 

 
After sending that, Tong Zhao said it was too late and she was going to bed.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied with an "OK" emoji and didn’t message her again to disturb her.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other that as soon as Tong Zhao sent him a message, he could instantly hear her slightly cold and lazy voice in his mind. So, that lengthy text felt like it came with its own sound effects for him.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit restless under the covers, pressing on his chest where his heart was and feeling a little excited.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to make a lot of money, wanted to invest everywhere, and wanted to grow the company strong…
 

 
That was what he wanted too; they shared a common goal.
 

 
Yes, they were partners and lifelong good brothers.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly laughed under the covers.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't dare to go online and scroll through Weibo, because everywhere she looked, there were insults directed at her.
 

 
Originally, a small-time star from a talent show would be virtually ignored online, and after a couple of days of criticism, it would die down.
 

 
The problem was that Tong Zhao, who had recently had a conflict with her, had become incredibly popular.
 

 
She was so famous that her promotional image for "Heartless Tribulation" featured her in a flowing white outfit, holding a long sword. Even those who hadn't seen the movie could recognize her. Her elegant features were hard to reconcile with her softer, delicate persona from "Sea King Kill."
 

 
"Is Tong Zhao's multifaceted subconscious not enough to explain her? Could she possibly have split personality disorder?"
 

 
[Don’t joke about it; there hasn't been a successful example of split personalities portraying different roles in film history.]
 

 
[That's because they aren't all handsome or beautiful / doge/doge.]
 

 
[Instead of wondering why there are so many facets to her subconscious, I'm more concerned about Zhao Zhao's mental health!]
 

 
This was the mainstream view among her fans.
 

 
They believed what Tong Zhao said; after all, each of her personalities had a similar, stubborn core. The essence was still her, just painted in different colors by her tumultuous life experiences...
 

 
“Miss Tong, please have a seat,”
 

 
In a consultation room at the headquarters of the Instinct Film Association, Dr. Gu, a refined gentleman, sat waiting.
 

 
Unlike an ordinary psychological clinic, there was a white holographic imaging chamber in the corner of the room.
 

 
Dr. Gu's gentle eyes, framed by silver-rimmed glasses, looked toward his first special guest of the day. “Would you like something to drink? The examination you’ll undergo will last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, depending on your performance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's unique subconscious had caught the association's attention.
 

 
The Instinct Film Association deals with the subconscious, which differs slightly from the needs of traditional psychologists. Therefore, doctors in this field require an additional license, and top talent is unique to the association. If this emerging actress truly has psychological issues, the association will provide assistance right away, rather than impose sanctions.
 

 
After all, even if she were a patient with schizophrenia, she wouldn't be breaking any laws.
 

 
The production team is willing to work with her, and she still has roles to play.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously declined an examination, but after learning more about the process this time, she didn't want to raise further doubts or cause concern for her genuinely caring friends, so she agreed to find time for it—
 

 
The association has a great reputation in the industry and stands by the actors.
 

 
After she refused the examination last time, some senior colleagues thought she was being cautious and had even comforted and advised her.
 

 
“Once the examination is complete, if everything is fine, can I post the results on Weibo?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
Dr. Gu paused for a moment before smiling. “Miss Tong, are you worried about your fans?”
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
“Of course, Miss Tong, you can think of it as filming a short video for your fans,” Dr. Gu said with a smile. “Actually, I’m one of your fans too.”
 

 
“Great! What do I need to do?”
 

 
Dr. Gu clasped his hands and said gently, “Once you connect to the holographic filming pod, you don’t need to play anyone else; just be yourself.”
 

 
Tong Zhao paused, then jokingly replied with a double entendre, “I haven’t been myself in a long time.”
 

 
“Well, being a big star means you can’t help it.”
 

 
Dr. Gu assumed she meant that stars have to wear a persona when facing the public.
# Chapter62
In the office of the Instinct Film Association.
 

 
"Sorry, I was a bit delayed."
 

 
The association's evaluator walked in and explained the upcoming examination to Tong Zhao: "This is a brand-new medical technology primarily used to understand a patient's psychological state. You can think of it as a CT scan for mental health."
 

 
Tong Zhao understood.
 

 
In medicine, a significant challenge in doctor-patient communication is that the results from consultations are not always accurate. Sometimes, patients may feel too embarrassed to speak up or fall into cognitive traps. For example, when told to fast before a test, a patient might think that drinking a bowl of chicken soup or millet porridge doesn’t count as eating—subjectively not lying, but objectively misleading the doctor.
 

 
Physiological illnesses can be easily identified with a CT scan; tumors cannot be hidden under skin fat. However, psychological ailments have traditionally relied on doctors building trust with patients, who might not even understand themselves.
 

 
With the rise of Instinct Film, the technology has advanced rapidly, propelled by profit, making psychological therapy more accessible.
 

 
"We've both signed confidentiality agreements. Once the examination results are ready, we will provide you with the original recording. If you consent, the association will keep a copy."
 

 
The evaluator made a routine reminder, addressing any concerns: "After all, even if it's just a simulation, many people are reluctant to let others see their inner world."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded to indicate understanding.
 

 
"You’re being too serious," Dr. Gu said with a smile as he turned the tablet to show Tong Zhao three screenshots of rooms. "These are the examination results of three actors who were my clients. They all enjoyed it and even shared their results on Weibo for their fans to see."
 

 
The three rooms included a princess room filled with pink toys, a Scandinavian-style living room, and a library surrounded by bookshelves.
 

 
They all looked quite positive, and Tong Zhao guessed the artists released them after discussing with their companies. Naturally, seeing her inner self align with her expectations made her happy.
 

 
"If..."
 

 
Dr. Gu smiled again, reassuring her: "The confidentiality of the results depends entirely on your personal wishes. Even if the company requests, we won’t disclose anything."
 

 
...
 

 
As Tong Zhao lay down in the white holographic chamber and closed her eyes, a familiar wave of drowsiness washed over her.
 

 
It was worth coming today.
 

 
She thought hazily, also curious about what her subconscious would be like now.
 

 
What was special this time was that, without character background settings or memory inputs, she experienced minimal discomfort, as if she naturally slipped into a gentle dream.
 

 
...
 

 
Once it was confirmed that the guest had entered the holographic scan, the evaluator turned and asked, "What do you think of Tong Zhao's situation?”
 

 
"Tong Zhao's subconscious richness should be greater than that of the average person, which allows her to deliver nuanced performances," Dr. Gu said, filled with admiration.
 

 
He truly was a fan of Tong Zhao, not just for her looks—perhaps due to his profession, he paid special attention to the subconscious traits of instinct film actors. "I suspect her palace of consciousness has more than one room."
 

 
According to past records stored in the association, older actors with richer experiences tend to have larger palaces of consciousness. Even within the same house, the layout and style can vary greatly. There was an established actor who sought help from the association due to psychological issues—
 

 
In a quaint entrance lit by incense, the living room resembled a rundown old house, with dusty windows and a mountain of greasy dishes in the kitchen. Inside the bedroom was a peculiar bed with a cage underneath.
 

 
This type of bed was meant for a certain indescribable group.
 

 
The actor opened the cage door and curled up inside, satisfied.
 

 
The bed was empty except for the trophies he had once earned.
 

 
"You think too highly of Tong Zhao," the evaluator remarked skeptically. "I admit her subconscious expressiveness and resilience are much stronger than current young actors, but she’s still young. It’s likely just one room with a few more things in it."
 

 
Out of professional habit, Dr. Gu didn’t refute him, simply waiting for the monitor to light up.
 

 
It was pitch black.
 

 
"Is it broken? Not connected?"
 

 
Just as the evaluator was about to troubleshoot, the lights came on.
 

 
Contrary to their expectations, Tong Zhao's palace of consciousness appeared quite simple.
 

 
Displayed on the screen was an empty, off-white circular platform, with a single chair in the center.
 

 
It was a very ordinary chair, one that could be bought on Taobao for just 9.99 yuan with free shipping.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the chair, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
"So this is what you call a higher subconscious richness?" The evaluator chuckled, mocking his colleague.
 

 
It seemed rather mundane.
 

 
But the next moment, as she awoke, doors began to emerge from the off-white walls like relief carvings. Each door was spaced about two meters apart, arranged neatly like a poorly managed rental unit, with doors stretching endlessly around Tong Zhao, as if mysterious monsters were about to leap out from behind them, ready to peel her thin frame and devour her.
 

 
The evaluator fell silent.
 

 
Not because he was embarrassed, but because the environment felt unsettling, reminiscent of a horror film.
 

 
Could a psychologically healthy person's palace of consciousness really look like this?
 

 
"Okay, let’s begin the instructions."
 

 
The evaluator operated the scanning chamber, inputting a psychological suggestion for Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I’ve lost something, but I don’t know where it’s hidden in the house."
 

 
This would prompt her to explore her palace of consciousness.
 

 
As the thought formed in her mind, Tong Zhao stood up from the chair and opened the first door…
 

 
A light mist poured out from the door, revealing a resplendent interior of a palace.
 

 
To their astonishment, reclining on an intricately carved bed was a beautiful young girl dressed in vibrant clothes!
 

 
Both of them widened their eyes in shock.
 

 
Typically, there wouldn’t be other living beings in a palace of consciousness. If there were, they would appear in the form of inanimate objects, like poorly made dolls, a vase with a name tag, or a human statue... Instinct films rarely allow for the spontaneous creation of another living person.
 

 
A whole team of modelers could labor tirelessly to create majestic landscapes.
 

 
Even a small stream would leave traces to follow.
 

 
But human thought cannot be constructed in such a way.
 

 
Even the top modeling experts can only create the appearance of a person; they cannot conjure a living human being in the holographic world.
 

 
That’s why a large number of temporary actors are needed.
 

 
"Calm down and think of Han Zhi from 'Sea King Killer,'" Dr. Gu offered an explanation. "Her subconscious is quite unique, which is why she can take on such diverse roles. This girl should be… the favored concubine from 'The Chronicles of Ming Emperor'?"
 

 
...
 

 
"Zhao Zhao,"
 

 
the vibrant girl turned her head, revealing a youthful face that looked about six years younger than the current Tong Zhao, with a delicate flower ornament on her forehead. "Are you here to play with me?"
 

 
In the ancient setting, Tong Zhao had entered the palace at a young age.
 

 
She quickly gained favor, surrounded by young girls, and had enjoyed years of privilege. Eventually, she left as the beloved of the young emperor after completing her mission.
 

 
In her memory, Concubine Chen looked just like this.
 

 
"I’ve lost something. I wanted to see if it might be in your palace."
 

 
"Were you not specifically looking for me?"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Concubine Chen became displeased.
 

 
She waved her hand, her delicate, snow-white arm adorned with gold bangles and silver bells that jingled with her movement. With a sense of entitlement, she ordered Tong Zhao, "Come here and give me a hug."
 

 
Despite still being considered a young girl in modern times, she exuded a vibrant charm.
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed quite accommodating, walking over to embrace her for a moment before stepping back when she felt satisfied.
 

 
She didn't find what she was looking for in this room.
 

 
The next room was a cluttered storage space filled with all sorts of items.
 

 
Dr. Gu focused his attention.
 

 
No, in the corner of the room was a nylon bed, so old and shabby that it blended completely with the background at first glance. Sitting on the nylon bed was a woman in a tank top and shorts, about 28 years old, with a more mature face marked by a scar running from her left cheek to her nose.
 

 
The woman seemed completely unconcerned, playing with a Swiss Army knife.
 

 
The knife flipped skillfully between her fingers.
 

 
The "storage room" contained survival supplies that most people could hardly imagine. If the room's owner lived in peaceful times, they would likely be teased for being overly prepared or a survivalist. The only light source in the room was a dim oil lamp beside the nylon bed, softening her strikingly aggressive beauty.
 

 
Duan Ge smiled when she saw Tong Zhao. "What a rare guest."
 

 
"I'm looking for something," Tong Zhao replied.
 

 
"You’d better hope you never need anything from here," Duan Ge said, concern evident in her gaze. "Are you feeling okay?"
 

 
With that, she stepped down from the nylon bed and embraced Tong Zhao tightly.
 

 
Duan Ge was a head taller than Tong Zhao, her muscular arms clearly defined.
 

 
The powerful hug provided a sense of security.
 

 
While hugging Concubine Chen earlier, Tong Zhao had felt like a big sister, but now, wrapped in Duan Ge's arms, she felt small like a child.
 

 
"Good girl, good girl," Duan Ge cooed.
 

 
Tong Zhao tilted her head back in protest. "I'm not a kid anymore!"
 

 
"In my eyes, you’re still a baby."
 

 
Her protest was futile; not only was she hugged, but Duan Ge also playfully ruffled her hair. Only after Duan Ge felt satisfied did she let her go.
 

 
"Who are these people?" the evaluator asked, puzzled.
 

 
"They might be different phases of Tong Zhao's self-image," Dr. Gu rationalized. "We all had that as kids, right? Imagining ourselves as masked warriors, chosen ones, or magical girls, and then dreaming that we really looked like that."
 

 
The evaluator asked, "What are Diga and masked warriors?”
 

 
Dr. Gu said, "…Forget it."
 

 
Tong Zhao almost escaped from Duan Ge's room.
 

 
Her fair cheeks were slightly flushed from the hug. After closing the door, she angrily wiped her face with the back of her hand and kicked Duan Ge's door as she turned to leave.
 

 
"Why are you so angry?"
 

 
A male voice came from behind her, and Tong Zhao turned around.
 

 
Han Zhi was smiling at her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Wait! Does her palace of consciousness operate like a shared rental? Is that even reasonable? Can her mind really hold that many fully developed characters? They can even engage in logical, peaceful conversations..."
 

 
While the evaluator's worldview shattered, he asked Dr. Gu, "Does this count as schizophrenia?"
 

 
"Your understanding of schizophrenia might be based on artistic representations," Dr. Gu replied.
 

 
The evaluator said, "Got it, multiple personalities aren’t this exaggerated."
 

 
Dr. Gu nodded, "I can’t say it’s completely out of the question."
 

 
While such cases are rare, they don't fall into illegal territory. Dr. Gu was more concerned about Tong Zhao’s physical health—one's brain functions like a hard drive, with a limited capacity. Even if no one knows the exact limit, having more than ten doors in this scenario, each potentially housing a "Tong Zhao," would be a heavy burden on her mind.
 

 
A rather bizarre image popped into Dr. Gu's head.
 

 
In her palace of consciousness, Tong Zhao could hold an "AKB48" general election and a "Produce 101" audition all by herself. Can you play mahjong alone? Sorry, I can complete an audition all by myself!
 

 
Well, Dr. Gu’s concerns didn’t materialize.
 

 
Besides Han Zhi, Tong Zhao only encountered two other people. The remaining doors, no matter how she twisted the knobs, were locked.
 

 
"Should we give her another suggestion?" the evaluator asked Dr. Gu.
 

 
"No, that’s enough."
 

 
Dr. Gu said.
 

 
After receiving Dr. Gu's permission, the evaluator gently extracted Tong Zhao's subconscious from the holographic scan. At the same time, Tong Zhao, lying in the chamber, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
Unlike the slight headache she usually felt after filming, this time she felt refreshed.
 

 
After sitting up and facing the two, she asked, "How long was I out?"
 

 
"Fifteen minutes," Dr. Gu paused. "How do you feel now? If you start to feel any headaches, I recommend going to the next room for some observation. Some professional therapists can help you relax through massage."
 

 
Unlike filming a movie, this examination was like a self-reflection.
 

 
Not everyone can walk away feeling comfortable.
 

 
Of course, it’s generally not a serious issue.
 

 
Dr. Gu had seen a client who had a breakdown, crying in her room and tearing apart a teddy bear that represented her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
"I don't need that for now."
 

 
"You can take a look at the recordings first."
 

 
Dr. Gu turned the tablet around so Tong Zhao could watch the replay.
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao saw herself interacting with her other personas in visual form. Although she could talk to them anytime in her mind, it lacked the physicality of a hug. During lonely times, she could only lie in bed hugging a long pillow.
 

 
It turned out she had always wanted to embrace herself in her subconscious.
 

 
The usually aloof Tong Zhao felt a bit embarrassed in front of others.
 

 
Concubine Chen found it hard to accept: [Why is this side of me so childish? I should be the one hugging you.]
 

 
Brother Duan, having had the rare opportunity to hug Tong Zhao, was eager to recover that brief memory.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao did not exhibit any antisocial tendencies during the examination, nor did she show any self-destructive inclinations rumored due to a lack of pain perception, Dr. Gu issued her a mental health certificate but reminded her:
 

 
"I'm not sure if you have a split personality, because in past clients with similar mental disorders, awareness of other personalities often leads to aggressive behavior... A body is like a ship; it only needs one captain, and everyone wants to give orders."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "But I don't."
 

 
"Right, you don't, so I think you can't be classified as having schizophrenia. You are quite whole," Dr. Gu affirmed her statement before gently suggesting, "If each door holds a different version of you, my advice is not to open too many doors."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused.
 

 
Seeing her hesitation, Dr. Gu chose not to press the topic further and instead discussed the promising box office trends of "Heartless Tribulation," even asking her for a photo and autograph with a fan-like enthusiasm. Tong Zhao was glad to change the subject and left after taking the picture. Before she walked away, she turned back and sincerely said:
 

 
"I'll think carefully about whether to open the next door. Thank you for your reminder."
 

 
Dr. Gu is a well-known scholar in the industry and holds significant standing within the Film Association. Without knowing of the system's existence, he gave advice similar to what the system had suggested—
 

 
The system had also indicated that with her current mental strength, she shouldn’t forcibly open too many doors.
 

 
However, not opening those doors meant some experiences and memories from certain worlds would be forever forgotten.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Don’t push yourself.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I know.]
 

 
Stepping out of the association's building, the flow of traffic and heat hit her face.
 

 
By the side of a minivan parked across the street stood her assistant, waving at her. The mundane reality felt like an anchor, stabilizing her steps as she quietly said:
 

 
"Becoming whole is everyone’s wish. If I can't even remember my past self, then the Tong Zhao of that time would be left there forever, right? I don’t want that."
 

 
Dr. Gu mentioned that many with split personalities display strong aggression toward their other selves.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the opposite.
 

 
She loved herself too much.
 

 
To the world, a small Tong Zhao was insignificant, and a brief segment of her long life was even more trivial.
 

 
Yet she would take on more instinctive films, exercising and expanding her mental strength time and again until she could open the next door.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Please wait for me a bit longer.]
 

 
…
 

 
In her mind, the other personas, recalling the examination, complained: [Tong Zhao just pushes herself too much; no wonder we all want to hug her in our subconscious.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I hugged her the hardest.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [I want to hug her too.]
 

 
…
 

 
After discussing with her manager, Tong Zhao decided to hand over the fifteen-minute video to a professional for review and editing, removing any unnecessary and redundant shots.
 

 
Fortunately, she had many skilled colleagues in her WeChat contacts, so she posted a status.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Does anyone know how to edit short videos and do post-production? Paid help needed.]
 

 
It was rare for Sister Zhao to post, and soon there was a long string of likes and comments, including some post-editing professionals she had previously added.
 

 
Just as she was about to pick someone familiar and reliable, she spotted a particularly familiar name—
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Am I qualified?]
 

 
Post-Production A: 【……】
 

 
Post-Production B: 【…… oh wow】
 

 
This was Shi Qianqiu!
 

 
His editing skills were top-notch, and every film project he worked on was a hit.
 

 
Back in school, he was said to have a million-follower fan account for film-related content, which was his underground alias. He gained fame for skillfully editing Harry Potter and Qingwen into an outrageous couple, but he never admitted it, making it an open secret in the industry.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wasn’t qualified, who could claim they were?
 

 
As soon as he applied, other editors felt sidelined.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it both amusing and frustrating, and immediately messaged him: [I can't afford you, you're too expensive.]
 

 
She couldn’t even imagine his fees.
 

 
[I don’t charge. I’m just bored, and my hands are itching. Is what you want to edit too troublesome? If there’s room for creativity, I’d love to try; if it’s dull, then forget it.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was very straightforward, which was the kind of person Tong Zhao enjoyed dealing with.
 

 
She sent him the short video: [This was filmed when I went to the association for an examination.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’ll take it.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You haven’t even watched it yet?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [A video with you in it will definitely not be boring.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was pleasantly surprised by the compliment.
 

 
His way of flattering people was unique, often leaving them speechless, with Xu Zhu and Chen Zhuzhi being perfect examples. But when he complimented her, he acted quite normally. After agreeing to edit, he went quiet, and Tong Zhao didn’t rush him. Meanwhile, her manager checked in: “Have you found a post-production editor? If not, I can recommend someone.”
 

 
“I found one.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked, “When will it be done?”
 

 
“I don’t know; I’ll leave it to him.”
 

 
"Who has such an attitude?" Sister Chu frowned, worried that Tong Zhao might be misled. Her own pampered artist always seemed so obedient. Despite Tong Zhao being fierce with outsiders, she was especially kind to her assistants and other behind-the-scenes staff; she wouldn’t lose her temper over small mistakes.
 

 
Which post-production editor had the audacity to act like this with Sister Zhao?
 

 
Tong Zhao, sipping her warm water slowly, mentioned a name: "Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
"……"
 

 
Sister Chu covered her face and retreated in defeat.
 

 
They would just have to wait; Shi Qianqiu was more of an artist than a worker.
 

 
In art, taking time to produce quality work was normal.
 

 
After getting Shi Qianqiu’s consent, Tong Zhao’s manager took their half-true collaboration news to market, capitalizing on the popularity of "The Heartless Tribulation" to elevate Tong Zhao's status…
 

 
To become a big star, a solid body of work was essential, and marketing could accelerate that process.
 

 
How to convince the public that she was a big star?
 

 
Collaborate frequently with major directors and screenwriters; have box office hits; hold high-end endorsements; and receive numerous positive reviews… Once the hype was in place, she could ride the wave.
 

 
Unexpectedly, after a week, Shi Qianqiu sent two finished products to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【One is just a simple edit.】
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【The original footage was good, so I added some extra material and edited it into an experimental short film. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to release it; consider it a gift for you to enjoy.】
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was preparing with her manager to head to the deserted island for promotional filming, so they watched it together.
 

 
They had both seen the original footage, which was an unremarkable fan-made short.
 

 
Fans would naturally be happy to see their sister in different styles, but it didn’t tell much of a story.
 

 
Tong Zhao sought a post-production editor just to make it more concise and add suitable background music.
 

 
In the end, Shi Qianqiu delivered a microfilm.
 

 
After watching the film, Chu Jie turned to her in a daze and said, "This... isn't cheap, right?”
# Chapter63
The two of them skeptically watched it again.
 

 
Since Shi Qianqiu said he only added a bit of material, Tong Zhao and her agent initially didn’t think too much of it and just watched it as a routine check.
 

 
—“I’m looking for something.”
 

 
—“Where is it?”
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard typing, these two lines of text gradually appeared on the dark screen, voiced by Tong Zhao with a hint of confusion and hesitation. She had just entered the holographic filming and received the evaluator’s suggestion, making her tone especially uncertain.
 

 
Using these two lines as a lead immediately piqued the audience’s curiosity about why Tong Zhao was showing a vulnerable side.
 

 
Tong Zhao and her agent had seen the original footage.
 

 
The suspense created by Shi Qianqiu was ineffective for them; they naturally assumed the next scene would be Tong Zhao's consciousness palace…
 

 
However, it wasn’t.
 

 
When the dark curtain was lifted, it turned out to be a scene from "Countdown 72 Hours," where Tong Zhao played Feng Yanqi, showing her looking around in a weapon shop for suitable firearms, highlighting the theme of "searching."
 

 
—“At any cost.”
 

 
The tone of this line was particularly high and aloof, carrying a ruthless determination that indicated no matter the means, even sacrificing everyone to achieve the goal was acceptable. Outside of the scene, Tong Zhao thought about it and concluded it was neither from "72 Hours" nor from the inspection results.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [From "Sea King Kill."]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [...He even watched that!]
 

 
The beautiful woman was speechless.
 

 
Following that ruthless line about "at any cost," Feng Yanqi's accelerated beatdown of the robbers began, with each strike perfectly timed to the background music's rhythm, creating a strong sense of impact. In the frame, she appeared as a fierce and stunning female warrior. The camera then zoomed in on her plucking bullets with tweezers, before suddenly closing in on a gruesome wound, taking up the entire shot. This was followed by Feng Yanqi, with a high level of intensity, storming into the research facility, shooting through hordes of zombies and engaging in close combat, ultimately collapsing from exhaustion.
 

 
"This transition!" Sister Chu exclaimed again.
 

 
"The fan-made vibe is so strong; that million-follower editor on Bilibili must be him." As Tong Zhao prepared for "Heartless Tribulation," she wanted to learn more about the director and proactively looked up news related to Shi Qianqiu, which included this information.
 

 
In the film, Feng Yanqi collapsed, closing her eyes.
 

 
Those who have seen "72 Hours" know that she gets the antidote and won't die.
 

 
However, at the moment she shut her eyes, the sound of a door opening echoed.
 

 
Behind the door was a shabby old storage room, filled to the brim with clutter.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, while the space was cramped, the items were organized in a very orderly manner and not messy at all. However, it was still not a comfortable room to stay in, and the nylon bed tucked in the corner only deepened this sense of discomfort.
 

 
On the bed, Duan Ge (brother) looked like a more mature Feng Yanqi, her face showing signs of age.
 

 
The world isn't just filled with youthful beauties; every age has its own charm. Duan Ge clearly lived a turbulent life, and her features, weathered by hardship, remained strikingly beautiful and aggressively alluring. The same high bridge of her nose and deep-set eyes that appeared on Concubine Chen's face had a seductive allure, while on Duan Ge, they resembled a brightly colored leopard—dazzling yet intimidating, making one awestruck but not daring to touch.
 

 
The original scene was softened by the dim yellow oil lamp, but Shi Qianqiu altered its tone, making it heavy and oppressive.
 

 
The oil lamp cast the silhouette of a slender figure against the wall as someone entered.
 

 
Who is this uninvited guest?
 

 
This was the hint and information provided by the visuals and background music.
 

 
Duan Ge looked up and smiled, "What a rare visitor."
 

 
"I came to find something."
 

 
Following Duan Ge's upward motion, the camera shifted too.
 

 
This camera movement allowed the viewers to share Duan Ge's perspective and clearly see the visitor—it was actually Tong Zhao! She was dressed in casual attire, looking most like her real-life self.
 

 
At this moment, the camera didn’t capture Duan Ge’s expression, even cutting out her voice, focusing instead on her tightly gripped Swiss Army knife, conveying the message that "Feng Yanqi is unhappy to see Tong Zhao" through body language alone.
 

 
Duan Ge: "At that time, I just wanted to hug Tong Zhao so badly that I tightened my grip on the Swiss Army knife."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "But you still hugged me, didn’t you?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "I couldn’t help it."
 

 
The next moment showed Duan Ge stepping forward to tightly embrace Tong Zhao.
 

 
— "Killing is a heavy crime," came the husky, mature tone of Duan Ge.
 

 
— "Isn’t it only natural to listen to me?" This was a cheeky, arrogant line from Concubine Chen.
 

 
Duan Ge held on tightly, burying her face in Tong Zhao's hair.
 

 
Removing their real dialogue and adding somber, tense background music made the conveyed message very clear, leaving behind huge questions... This mature version of Tong Zhao listened to her orders to kill while simultaneously searching for something, establishing a clear dominant-submissive relationship between them.
 

 
The question remained: What were they searching for? Why did they share such strikingly similar features?
 

 
Montage editing can manipulate time and space, playing with the narrative. The director would cut out scenes deemed unnecessary, sometimes inserting footage from different timelines, locations, or even entirely different films to construct a fabricated storyline.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "What does this Shi person mean? Am I ordering Duan Ge to kill?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "If you need it, I'm more than willing."
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled delightfully.
 

 
In the film, immediately after "Isn't it only natural to listen to me?" was a passionate kiss between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao in the pottery studio from "Sea King Kill"...
 

 
After a long kiss, they locked eyes, and Han Zhi whispered:
 

 
"Of course, I'll listen to you."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had somehow obtained a lossless audio version, and with headphones on, it felt as if Han Zhi was whispering directly into the viewers' ears, causing Sister Chu to blush, while she was left stunned by this cross-genre dialogue: "This works too?"
 

 
"Basic operation. It’s clear you don’t often watch romantic pairing edits.”
 

 
Hearing her artist say this, Sister Chu began to consider spending more time on Bilibili.
 

 
She followed the data feedback from major video platforms, but terms like "la lang" left her feeling completely confused.
 

 
Next, they cut to clips of Han Zhi flirting with Zhong Muxi and Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The two girls were infatuated with their idol, interspersed with Han Zhi's gaze towards them that hinted at pity, suggesting he was seducing them at Tong Zhao's command, something he didn't want to do. The final clip of Zhong Muxi self-harming placed the blame squarely on Han Zhi.
 

 
Han Zhi: "..."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Wow, my brother's reputation is suffering."
 

 
However, the next clip split the blame between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—
 

 
Leaning lazily against the doorframe, Tong Zhao asked, "She didn’t cry and run away?"
 

 
After speaking, a haughty smile appeared on her delicate, beautiful face, exuding a poisonous charm.
 

 
— "Nowhere to be found; I can’t find it."
 

 
Tong Zhao's voice in the monologue grew increasingly irritable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "This is what I said in 'Sea King Kill' when I couldn’t find Wei Zekai."
 

 
The ending of this segment transitioned to an empty mansion, suggesting abandonment.
 

 
— "Sometimes I feel like he needs a little stimulation."
 

 
— "Without some stimulation, how would he know the potential he could unleash?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is…"
 

 
Chen Guifei: "I saw He Shun's inner monologue.”
 

 
Sure.
 

 
What played next was a scene of Chen Zhuzhi portraying Shao Xuanzheng, pacing back and forth in front of the alchemy furnace on the night before he attacked his partner, murmuring, "If I really do this, there’s no turning back..."
 

 
The shadows on the alchemy furnace flickered, accompanied by Tong Zhao's light, arrogant mockery: "Always thinking about turning back; no wonder you achieve nothing."
 

 
This was from "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the concubine belittles the other consorts.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng's inner struggle was edited by Shi Qianqiu into a dialogue.
 

 
Next, it seemed that everything Mu Yingchen suffered was manipulated by Tong Zhao from behind.
 

 
Concubine Chen praised sweetly: "This segment is well edited; Director Shi is a genius!"
 

 
The edit focused on her bullying of Lu Xianzhang, and Shi Qianqiu immediately elevated from "that Shi" to "Director Shi," changing his tone faster than flipping a page.
 

 
The manager was speechless: "Is Director Shi playing with his own film?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "He seems to be having a lot of fun."
 

 
After the misleading editing of "Heartless Tribulation," the scene shifted to Tong Zhao visiting Lu Xianzhang in the consciousness palace. At that moment, Lu Xianzhang was meditating in a corner, giving Shi Qianqiu ample space to create something out of nothing, first cutting to Lu Xianzhang with his eyes closed—
 

 
Lu Xianzhang appeared as a twenty-eight-year-old version of Tong Zhao, about the same age as Duan Ge, but showing signs of a life of luxury, exuding a cool, ethereal presence like a fallen immortal.
 

 
Though it was the same face and age, viewers could clearly feel that this was not the same person.
 

 
Inserting Mu Yingchen's original voice: "Are you satisfied now?"
 

 
"I will never be satisfied." This was the concubine's line.
 

 
Under Shi Qianqiu's editing, "Tong Zhao" in the consciousness palace was searching for something while continuously issuing commands for these "selves" to do bad deeds, not hesitating to harm them to achieve her goals, clearly portraying a behind-the-scenes manipulator, a super big boss.
 

 
During the second viewing, Tong Zhao noticed a detail: "The order is reversed this time; in the original, I first saw the concubine, then went to the storage room."
 

 
Why edit it this way?
 

 
Is it just a matter of habit?
 

 
At this point, the scene switches to "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the first clip shows the concubine being pushed into a palace by her family, instructed to serve the emperor well and gain his favor. Her youthful face reveals a hint of fear and confusion. This segment was a hard-won edit by the director of "The Ming Emperor," as Tong Zhao usually appears very confident and ambitious.
 

 
What is weakness? It doesn't exist.
 

 
In the scene, the young Tong Zhao closes her eyes tightly, as if trying to blink away her tears.
 

 
When she opens her eyes again, she sees the luxurious concubine, who turns around with an air of unmatched nobility: "Are you here to accompany me?"
 

 
The playful words were cut out.
 

 
After seeing the younger face that resembled her own, Tong Zhao had a sudden realization about the arrangement of the scenes—
 

 
the age difference.
 

 
From maturity to innocence, the concubine is the younger one.
 

 
"Aren't you here specifically to find me?"
 

 
"Come here and hug me."
 

 
In the original version, Tong Zhao's words were completely muted, leaving only a silent, hopeless embrace.
 

 
In film and television, silence and blank spaces are also a form of expression.
 

 
This transitions into another embrace—between the Ming Emperor, played by Song Wanzhuo, and the concubine. She opens her arms to wrap around the emperor, tilting her face up to flirt with him for a moment before resting her head against his chest. From the emperor's unseen angle, her youthful and beautiful face breaks into a slight smile, and the ambitious spark in her eyes burns like two flames, making the concubine even more captivating.
 

 
Sister Chu commented, "This uses a contrast of strength and weakness. She wants to use the Ming Emperor, but when you embrace her, she is fully reliant on you."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Wanzhuo has become a reliable tool."
 

 
Fast forward to the concubine's grand ceremony.
 

 
The concubine said, "With the queen gone, I am now the most esteemed woman in the world."
 

 
She asked, "Are you satisfied?"
 

 
Under the clear sky, countless noblewomen bowed to her. The splendidly beautiful concubine, adorned with heavy makeup, appeared even more stunning, yet her true emotions remained inscrutable.
 

 
—“Not enough, still not enough.”
 

 
This line is also spoken by the concubine in "Ming Emperor."
 

 
Each word captures her insatiable ambition and darkness.
 

 
Outside of the scene, the concubine remarked, "So, I even torment myself when I go crazy?"
 

 
The camera ended with a shot of a noblewoman who once troubled the concubine, bowing her head in resentment. As she lowered her head, the view went dark, and when it brightened again, it revealed a door opening in the consciousness palace.
 

 
This time, it was a door leading out from a room into a vast white hall…
 

 
“Tong Zhao.”
 

 
It was Han Zhi's voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to meet his deep, melancholic eyes.
 

 
Here, apart from the call, all other lines were cut, and unnecessary contact was removed, leaving only Tong Zhao walking toward one of the rooms.
 

 
The door was opened just a crack, but was caught by a security chain.
 

 
A small, soft white hand reached out from within.
 

 
At this moment, Shi Qianqiu pulled a side mirror for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Cold white light shone from the side, casting deeper contrasts on her expressionless face. Her pale eyes churned with nameless emotions, resembling an unfathomable abyss. Objectively speaking, Tong Zhao's expression was serious and heavy, with a hint of struggle that made her appear somewhat fierce.
 

 
—“You’re next.”
 

 
This was the thought of the concubine when she saw Wei Zekai in "Sea King Kill."
 

 
As soon as the words fell, that obviously childlike hand was firmly grasped by Tong Zhao.
 

 
The screen abruptly plunged into darkness.

---
 

 
The manager, Sister Chu, was a bit suspicious of her eyes. She opened the original film on her phone and scrolled to the last part.
 

 
When the last door was stuck by the security chain, a childish voice from behind it apologized, "Zhao Zhao, I'm sorry. I can’t reach the chain even if I jump."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded patiently, "It's okay, I'll find a way."
 

 
Then she comfortingly held the child's small hand.
 

 
The two clearly had a very close relationship, trusting each other.
 

 
However, under the editing of Shi Qianqiu, Tong Zhao was portrayed as a cruel and cold mysterious figure, behind whose manipulation lay the misfortunes of many worlds, ultimately even resorting to harming innocent children. After watching this footage, Dr. Gu from the Instinct Film Association would likely suspect her of having antisocial and inhumane tendencies.
 

 
In plain terms, she was edited into a villainous character.
 

 
Although there are too many flaws to know where to start, objectively speaking, Tong Zhao admits that Shi Qianqiu made the character of "Tong Zhao" quite charming. Whether it’s the color grading, camera angles, or the accompanying BGM, she appears as a dark and beautiful mysterious villain.
 

 
She sent a message to Shi Qianqiu: "So what is the protagonist actually looking for?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: "I don’t know!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "It was just an idea from the evaluator for you to explore the consciousness palace more, to gather more information—there's no deeper reason."
 

 
Good point, “I don’t know.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Then didn’t you just turn it into a story? Digging a pit and not filling it?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Digging pits and not filling them is indeed one of my specialties.”
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered and opened Shi Qianqiu's Bilibili account, checking the section labeled "His Videos." It featured his representative work, "[Harry X Qingwen] So Sexual," along with a bunch of "series" like "When Qingwen Travels to the HP World (Part 1)," "Wang Xifeng Teaches Iron Man Business (Part 1)," "Jia Mu Visits Stark Tower (Part 1)," and "[Lu Zhishen X Loki] Mu Shaoai (Part 1)..."
 

 
The reason for the quotation marks around "series" is that once he finishes one, there’s no follow-up.
 

 
No matter how well-received or how many collections and likes he gets, he remains unfazed—no sequels, digging pits without filling them!
 

 
That's right.
 

 
As mentioned earlier, Shi Qianqiu is not a perfect person; he has bold ideas and creative editing but lacks strong logic. He often has short-lived enthusiasm, digs a pit, and then doesn’t want to fill it, with grand plans that he can't follow through. It's common for authors to finish works out of necessity, but he isn’t short on money and digs pits for fun, which is even more infuriating.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu kindly let her use the materials freely; he had already negotiated with the copyright holders.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Okay.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had inadvertently fallen into the pit, no longer wanted to talk to the "Pit King."
 

 
She explained the situation and posted both versions edited by Shiqianqiu on Weibo.
 

 
@TongZhaov:
 

 
"Did a check at the association.
 

 
@ShiQianqiu helped edit the film, adding a bit of material for a micro-movie version. Watch whichever you prefer."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted the micro-movie version on Weibo.
 

 
So, while her agent was marketing behind the scenes, they mainly pushed that post... In reality, the marketing money was just icing on the cake. Who is Shi Qianqiu? Tong Zhao is currently the hottest actress, with countless eyes focused on her. There had been speculation about their collaboration, and some imaginative netizens even claimed that their next joint announcement would definitely be about a wedding.
 

 
This scared many of Tong Zhao's career fans.
 

 
When her family matters were brought to light, her mother—who had once won a Best Actress award—was also dug up. Fans feared that Tong Zhao might end up like her mother, marrying and retiring from acting with no more works. They really didn’t want her to date—after all, they hadn’t seen enough of her films!
 

 
Instead of wedding news, fans received a micro-movie.
 

 
While they felt relieved, they were also a bit pleased.
 

 
In the past, some actors had shared their examination videos from the Association, creating an intimate feeling similar to reading a diary from their idol's private account.
 

 
Non-fans were also curious about Tong Zhao's examination results.
 

 
After all, she was known for her strong and unique subconscious.
 

 
How special could she be without the halo of her character templates?
 

 
Fans and onlookers clicked on the original link to the micro-movie.
 

 
It started with clips from "Countdown 72 Hours," and early fans were quite happy, but soon they sensed something was off.
 

 
First, a flood of question marks filled the screen.
 

 
[？？？？]
 

 
[Wow, where's this footage from? So much information!]
 

 
[Strangers asking for the source—this scene of a handsome guy being told to raise fish is so engaging, which idol drama is it from?]
 

 
[Hey, don't go, that’s not an idol drama; it’s from the variety show "Sea King Kill," and the truth isn’t like that…]
 

 
[Fans who have watched all of Tong Zhao's works assure you that the original story isn't set up this way!]
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans found themselves in a bizarre loop of accepting the problematic setting, thinking, “Once you accept it, it really feels amazing.” Meanwhile, confused onlookers became curious about the "original work," and after some explanation, they regretfully questioned:
 

 
[Alright then, where are these different age versions of Tong Zhao from?]
 

 
This…
 

 
The fans didn't know either.
 

 
Fortunately, the micro-movie was quite short. After watching it, the puzzled fans immediately went to see the examination result video edited by Shi Qianqiu, which was generally more authentic. This video's comments were sparse, and its view count was less than half that of the micro-movie.
 

 
[How many people are hidden in Sister Zhao’s mind???]
 

 
[Wow, don't worry about the number; just think about how much space is in a room—her subconscious intensity must be terrifying.]
 

 
[Incredible, Sister Zhao doesn't need character settings; she’s special enough on her own.]
 

 
[Is this really okay? The Association determined Zhao Zhao is healthy?] This came from fans who cared about Tong Zhao's well-being.
 

 
Discussion about Tong Zhao herself was mostly from those concerned about the entertainment industry.
 

 
Outsiders who only watched the micro-movie edited by Shi Qianqiu were captivated by the fabricated plot, thinking it was a trailer for some lengthy TV drama.
 

 
This clearly has a complete worldview and suspense that can be deeply explored!
 

 
So, some insiders, eager for drama, started spreading the news: “Shi Qianqiu is venturing into TV dramas! Once again collaborating with Tong Zhao for an ultra-long exquisite trailer
 

 
[video link]
 

 

 
.”
 

 
There’s even a plot summary, making it sound like a classic quick-transmigration story.
 

 
The production quality of this micro-movie is indeed excellent—its pacing is quick, easy to understand, and engaging. The suspense of the main character, who is also the behind-the-scenes antagonist, searching for something runs throughout the trailer, leading to unexpected buzz. It topped the daily charts of major video platforms, and even with fans frequently clarifying that this is not a TV drama, many netizens kept asking in confusion:
 

 
[When is Tong Zhao’s new drama airing?]
 

 
[Is Song Wanzhuo playing a supporting role? Zhao Jie is amazing!]
 

 
[Have I seen this Han Zhi before?]
 

 
With such a high-quality production, how could it just be a fan vlog?
 

 
It must be fans playing a joke!
 

 
…
 

 
Daily monitoring market feedback, agent Sister Chu remarked, “Tong Zhao, if you don’t turn this into a TV drama, it’ll be hard to wrap things up.”
 

 
“...Who cares? I’m off to survive on a deserted island.”
# Chapter64
It was originally possible to love whoever.
 

 
Imagination can be very aloof, but reality is full of complexities.
 

 
While the edited version went viral, surprisingly, the original version saw a drop in shares the next day in an unexpected manner—
 

 
Generally speaking, a Weibo post that gets thousands of shares goes through a fermentation process. It rises to a peak, then those interested share it early, followed by a stagnation and gradual decline until it fades into obscurity—this is the norm on Weibo.
 

 
Unless someone stirs the pot.
 

 
And someone did.
 

 
"Zhang Wenshi's Sharp Commentary: Tong Zhao is a Distorted Product of the Era's Excessive Reverence for Unique Subconsciousness"
 

 
[On October 22, 20xx, a sensational xianxia film officially premiered in all of Huaxia. This film faced countless doubts from preparation to release, with criticisms that no one could fulfill the role of the female lead. Then, Tong Zhao, symbolizing the "correct answer," fit in like the final puzzle piece of the film.]
 

 
Subsequently, the two biggest attention-seekers in all of Huaxia "collaborated" again, releasing a microfilm and a meticulously edited inspection video.
 

 
[In the era of instinctive cinema, unique subconsciousness is revered.]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is the most devoted follower of this genre. As a screenwriter, his actions are shameful; he indulges actors in straying from the path in the film and then calls it a masterpiece when they accidentally get it right? I cannot agree with that.]
 

 
[From Tong Zhao's original inspection footage, it’s clear that her most unique subconscious trait is possessing numerous distinct "personalities," rich enough for a holographic scanning system to model them in the palace of consciousness... I admit this is indeed special, but is it really worthy of praise?]
 

 
[Amidst all the admiration and accolades, I still have to say no.]
 

 
[Looking back, did Tong Zhao present different performances in "The Legend of Ming Emperor," "Countdown 72 Hours," and "Heartless Tribulation"? Is that truly excellent for instinctive cinema? Or is it an unstable hidden bomb? In the first three instances, she lucked out by showcasing the right side... Just think, if Tong Zhao from her concubine period were to star in a post-apocalyptic survival film, it would be a disaster!]
 

 
[The subconscious stability of seasoned instinctive actors only experiences a few fluctuations throughout their long careers due to real-life experiences, which is an understandable norm. From Tong Zhao's films, it's evident that she possesses far too much uncertainty; every performance is like rolling dice!]
 

 
[The vast majority of instinctive actors are quite stable, consistently playing similar roles and delivering outstanding performances. Tong Zhao relies on this characteristic to take chances in her films... I must admit, her luck is quite good; she always manages to roll the side she wants.]
 

 
[The emergence of this distorted unstable subconscious may be a responsibility we all share.]
 

 
[It is a tragedy of this era, and also a tragedy for the new generation of instinctive actors—]
 

 
[Just a friendly reminder, aside from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao has never used the same "personality" twice.]
 

 
……
 

 
This pointedly controversial post was shared by several entertainment accounts with millions of followers.
 

 
Fans and bystanders were a bit confused in the replies.
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has never done anything extreme or stirred up negative news; her public image is that of someone who works diligently.
 

 
However, after glancing a few times, bystanders found some validity in what this Zhang said.
 

 
Tong Zhao's subconscious is indeed quite unique!
 

 
Mainstream voices pursuing distinct subconsciousness might be overhyping it, potentially giving rise to a new generation of "Tong Zhaos." Clicking into the original post's comments revealed a flood of similar sentiments, expressing concern that Tong Zhao's unconventional acting style would ultimately lead to her downfall.
 

 
The retweets displayed a variety of opinions.
 

 
Some argued that he shouldn’t have criticized her by name, claiming it was overly provocative.
 

 
Others said he was just stirring the pot for attention, pointing out that Tong Zhao had never actually faltered in her performances.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi separately retweeted with: [I’m not targeting her; I’m targeting this kind of atmosphere.]
 

 
Some retweets wondered why the original post's comments were so one-sided.
 

 
It turned out the blogger had enabled a feature that highlights selected comments, which is why all the visible responses agreed with her. Uninformed netizens saw the comments and developed a herd mentality.
 

 
[Tong Zhao, whose heart did you stab? Look how sour the original poster is.]
 

 
[Check the box office of "Heartless Tribulation," then take a look at the industry... Turns out they aren't jealous of Tong Zhao; they're envious of Shi Qianqiu but don’t want to be too obvious, so they target Tong Zhao instead. After all, she is Shi Qianqiu’s most admired subconscious!]
 

 
[Witnessing the meltdown of a loser screenwriter.]
 

 
[Not every screenwriter gets to work with a subconscious as exceptional as Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
[Am I the only one who thinks the original poster's concerns are quite reasonable?]
 

 
---
 

 
Zhang Wenshi mentioning both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu essentially included "Heartless Tribulation" in the conversation.
 

 
The number of retweets surprised even him.
 

 
After all, the film's buzz had been extremely high lately—
 

 
How high?
 

 
Within three days of its release, the top trending topic on Zhihu was "How to evaluate the movie 'Heartless Tribulation'?"
 

 
Following that were various related questions and articles. Not only serious titles like "In-Depth Analysis of 'Heartless Tribulation'! The True Meaning Behind Mu Yingchen's Quest for the Sword," and "Who dares to say they understand Tong Zhao?" but also open-ended storytelling questions like "If you were Mu Yingchen, how would you break the deadlock?" had numerous responses.
 

 
The enthusiasm for the movie among netizens is clearly still high.
 

 
When you're on the cutting edge, even pigs can fly.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is a hot topic right now, and Zhang Wenshi has opened this conversation from an alternative angle.
 

 
Previous discussions mainly focused on the film itself.
 

 
His critical review shifted the audience's attention from the movie to Tong Zhao's subconscious traits.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Who is this Zhang Wenshi?"
 

 
The article was sent to her by an outraged assistant, and discussions were also happening in the crew's WeChat group. Tong Zhao couldn't recall offending him and felt a bit confused.
 

 
But after a moment of bewilderment, she regained her composure.
 

 
Even a scathing piece like this could gain traction, indicating she's riding the wave of popularity—something to be happy about.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Yeah, who is it?"
 

 
As soon as he popped up, a prop master chimed in: "It's your rival, Director Shi! He's your counterpart!"
 

 
Director Shi was shocked: "I have a rival?"
 

 
Immediately, a more informed crew member jumped in to enlighten them about the situation.
 

 
He indeed has a rival.
 

 
In fact, the number of rivals he has might even exceed some popular figures in the industry.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu is straightforward and often acts arrogantly, which has drawn criticism from many within the industry.
 

 
He was very easygoing with his subordinates and staff. Teased as the last eunuch in China for his habit of digging holes and not filling them, he didn’t take offense when called “Old Thief Shi” or “Eunuch Shi.” Sometimes, if the jokes went on too long, he would cryptically remark, “Impotence is actually the key to unlocking the second gate of wisdom for men; it's a blessing,” leaving people too stunned to continue murmuring about him.
 

 
With his peers, if someone wanted to discuss professional topics, he wouldn’t beat around the bush. He said exactly what he thought, often putting others in awkward positions. Yet, he had a divine talent for editing and directing, as if fate itself was feeding him.
 

 
At one dinner, the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi of "Non-Official Lover" learned that Shi Qianqiu had seen the preview of his film and insisted on getting his feedback. After being turned down twice, Zhang insisted on downing three drinks as a form of self-punishment, claiming that if Shi didn’t provide feedback, he should at least drink with him.
 

 
Shi wasn’t angry. Instead, he looked at Zhang with pity, thinking how poorly written it was, yet the writer was so eager to improve that he openly sought advice. It was truly a spirit of literary sacrifice.
 

 
"Alright, let’s help him out."
 

 
"I did watch 'Non-Official Lover.' I was quite surprised to see someone deliberately avoiding all the popular answers for innovation. It’s easy to imagine the writer trying to break the mold and ending up with a hodgepodge of disconnected sketches. Since the story wasn’t told well and didn’t please the audience... My suggestion? The best advice is to stop treating the audience and mainstream as fools. If you don’t understand why certain tropes are popular, don’t try to break them. Show some respect for your audience."
 

 
After encouraging drinking all evening, the previously tipsy screenwriter Zhang Wenshi instantly sobered up.
 

 
He couldn’t have been more awake.
 

 
The room fell silent, with the women he had forced to drink stifling laughter to the point of oxygen deprivation.
 

 
When "Non-Official Lover" was released, the box office indeed crashed, just as Shi Qianqiu predicted. A well-known critic, unaware of their feud, gave a similar review: "The screenwriter seems to misunderstand tropes. In the process of exploring innovation, constant attempts can overwhelm a film. If the skill isn’t sufficient, there shouldn’t be more than one or one-and-a-half innovative attempts in a single movie—films require guiding the audience. If the director is also uncertain, how can they lead?" He ended with recognition of the writer’s innovative spirit, giving him face.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was right about everything.
 

 
But he was too harsh.
 

 
The consequence of being harsh is having no friends, spending every day digging holes at home. Shi willingly accepted this outcome, conveniently avoiding unnecessary social interactions. Some colleagues, struck by his critiques but unwilling to admit it, harbored grudges against him while trying to console themselves that he simply couldn’t give compliments.
 

 
Humans are strange creatures; when one discovers that someone is consistently critical, it softens the sting of their own criticisms.
 

 
This balance worked well—until the anomaly, Tong Zhao, appeared.
 

 
Shi praised her highly, proving that he could indeed speak kindly. His compliments and criticisms were genuine, which only made those he had criticized feel even worse about themselves.
 

 
Take the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, for instance.
 

 
He was quite pleased when "Heartless Tribulation" was indefinitely shelved due to the inability to find a lead actress, secretly celebrating with champagne at home—how could Shi Qianqiu criticize him for having high expectations? At Shi's standards for female leads, it could take ten more years to make this film!
 

 
However, before he could finish the discounted champagne, "Heartless Tribulation" officially announced its lead actress.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi: …damn it.
 

 
As he watched the film rise to great heights, breaking box office records, he…
 

 
Had nothing better to do than write little essays and shower praise on Tong Zhao, damn!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi's mindset could have been balanced; it was Tong Zhao who ruined it for him.
 

 
He bought the viewing rights for "Heartless Tribulation" and watched it in a holographic cinema no less than three times. Given Shi Qianqiu's negative reputation with him, along with the bias of his colleagues, he couldn’t understand why this film was so successful.
 

 
It was too cliché!
 

 
Wasn’t it just a typical female empowerment story?
 

 
Although Zhang Wenshi didn’t predict that Mu Yingchen would experience a rebirth through adversity, he did foresee the reversal. The later Goldfinger moments given to the female lead by Shi were plentiful—Tong Zhao delivered a performance worthy of the extravagant budget, delighting the audience and reflecting positively at the box office, leading to a significant profit.
 

 
Box office figures are straightforward data that can be checked online at any time.
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming praise for the two of them in the news, Zhang Wenshi felt a slight crack in his composure.
 

 
Initially, he simply disliked Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He believed that "Heartless Tribulation" became successful due to the lead actress's influence. If he could get Tong Zhao for his own project, he could also create a blockbuster!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi happened to be working on a film that still needed a lead actress. The director and producers agreed with his suggestion that Tong Zhao would be an excellent choice, so they sent the script to her agent, expressing their interest in inviting her.
 

 
Tong Zhao declined.
 

 
The film was titled "Chasing Immortals."
 

 
Just hearing the title felt like a trend-chaser, and Tong Zhao didn't want to repeat herself or slow her momentum; she needed to rest—so she turned it down casually, having rejected countless offers lately, and didn’t take this small matter to heart.
 

 
The director and producers of "Chasing Immortals" didn't mind much either.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao's market value was soaring, with billions in box office earnings. If she agreed to star in another fantasy film, that would truly shock them!
 

 
Only Zhang Wenshi cared deeply.
 

 
Without Tong Zhao, it seemed he could never compete on the same stage as Shi Qianqiu…
 

 
This "harsh critique" was a product of his imbalanced mindset.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi originally just wanted to vent, but he didn't expect many who envied "Heartless Tribulation" box office and resented Tong Zhao's recent success to rally behind him, firing the first shot against her—
 

 
Calling it an attack felt more like a way to vent their frustrations.
 

 
Tong Zhao had only just debuted a little over a year ago, and at such a young age, what if it affected her mindset? In the era of instinctual filmmaking, mindset has a significant impact on the subconscious. Some young actors, in order to adjust their mentality, choose to take breaks during their peak times.
 

 
"This is a psychological tactic; Zhang Wenshi seems like a fool being used in the moment… Just look at his previous conflicts with Shi Qianqiu to see he isn’t very smart."
 

 
Agent Chu analyzed this for Tong Zhao, hoping she wouldn’t be affected.
 

 
This is also a product of the instinctual filmmaking era, which focuses on actors' mindsets, akin to how they used to sabotage singers' voices.
 

 
"Don't worry, my mindset is solid; I’m very stable," Tong Zhao reassured her. "Think positively—I’m about to get popular again!"
 

 
Being comforted by an artist who could be her niece, Chu was a bit amused. She said, "You still have the energy to cheer me up! I'm fine; can there really be a problem? My biggest issue is that my throat hurts from all the calls I’ve been getting, all wanting to invite you to be the lead!"
 

 
"Isn't that the case with every project?"
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t react much.
 

 
"In the past, only similar types of projects would invite you. Now, well… I can’t say all, but among the scripts being produced daily in Huaxia, removing those who know they can’t afford you or those already designated with better options, most roles will first come to you. You’ll pick from what’s left, and only then will others get a chance to compete. Sigh, anyone who can call me has some skills; the rest just email me, which is making my eyesight worse.”
 

 
Sister Chu spoke with a tone that suggested regret yet was filled with genuine delight as she boasted.
 

 
After she finished, she glanced at Tong Zhao, waiting for her reaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “If your throat hurts, drink more warm water and make sure there’s plenty of light in the room.”
 

 
…Okay, her artist's mindset should be fine now.
 

 
The discussion in the WeChat group was lively; after all, this was clearly aimed at undermining ‘Heartless Tribulation’ and its golden crown.
 

 
Modeling artist: “Will it affect the box office? It hasn’t even peaked yet.”
 

 
Supporting actor: “Come on, Shi, do something. Isn’t it time to buy him some help?”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “Should I speak up to support Zhao Zhao? That guy is turning Tong Zhao into someone who seems ready to collapse at any moment!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Support Sister Zhao!”
 

 
The actress playing Qing Niang, Fu Xiaoheng, was eager to call him Master. She felt a strong connection and was even more outraged than Tong Zhao, who was being slandered; she had already retweeted and blasted Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Should I respond?”
 

 
The director wanted to set a good example for everyone.
 

 
However, the crowd immediately restrained him.
 

 
He was a public relations disaster who spoke too loudly.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng understood and took on the responsibility, representing ‘Heartless Tribulation’ with a brief statement. He assured that the entire film's production was legal and compliant, with no crew members experiencing psychological issues during filming. He emphasized that the team didn’t glorify anyone but simply aimed to make a good movie while trying some new approaches to entertain the audience.
 

 
He shared this statement with the group for review before posting, receiving unanimous praise like “Top-notch bureaucratic tone,” “That basically means nothing!” and “This definitely won’t be a problem now!” among other affirmations.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng was relatively unknown, a non-entity in the film industry, with only a few thousand fans on Weibo—one-third bought, one-third given away.
 

 
His voice was reliable, but no one paid him any attention.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: "Hey, Shi, you should retweet and support this!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted.
 

 
So he wanted him to back him up?
 

 
He was sincere, not cutting corners with fast-forward, and added, “Well said!” to show his support.
 

 
However, the comments and retweets below didn’t match Shi Qianqiu’s expectations—
 

 
[Deputy Director’s words seemed normal, but once Shi Old Thief retweeted, it took on a strange vibe.]
 

 
[Now it feels off.]
 

 
[Aren’t you going to say something else? We’re waiting for you to confront someone!]
 

 
Many were eager to see him clash with Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Netizens were excitedly following the situation. Since Shi Qianqiu retweeted the crew’s stance, Tong Zhao should come out and say something too! They kept refreshing Tong Zhao’s Weibo page until finally, her response appeared—
 

 
@Tong Zhao V:
 

 
“Well said! //@Shi Qianqiu: Well said!”
 

 
[Deputy Director Zeng’s Weibo]
 

 
…
 

 
Originally, Deputy Director Zeng’s serious comments became amusing after being mixed up with the two big names.
 

 
Fans, who were initially angry, were amused by their sister’s tweet.
 

 
[Sister, don’t get led astray! /laughing and crying/ laughing and crying.]
 

 
[If it goes astray, so be it. Isn’t optimism better? Just don’t let it affect your mindset. What’s so special about subconsciousness? I love every version of Tong Zhao (especially Han Zhi).]
 

 
[Same here! It’s all Tong Zhao herself (especially love for Han Zhi).]
 

 
Some of the popular comments got sidetracked, while the rest understood the main points the subject wanted to express, organizing their agreement—returning to the film itself, Tong Zhao is healthy, gets along well with the crew, and doesn’t give off any sour vibes.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans understood the message.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng opened with a solid start, but he never expected the two to take a sharp turn, leaving the supporting cast to go along with the humor, using the format “Well said!” to uniformly express their stance.
 

 
These catchy four words washed over the audience’s minds.
 

 
# "The Heartless Tribulation" Crew: Well said! #
 

 
The tension was diffused by humor. It was the weekend, and many workers connected to the holographic network, interested in the topic on Weibo, bought viewing rights.
 

 
“Heartless Tribulation" not only exploded in popularity but also had lasting momentum.
 

 
Previously, there was a chorus of praise, and many were curious enough to watch, with some managing to hold back. Now that there were questioning voices, those who had hesitated were even more curious—
 

 
Is it really that good?
 

 
Good enough to make peers jump in frustration?
 

 
When Zhang Wenshi saw this question, he nearly had a heart attack from anger.
 

 
[It really is that good! Mu Yingchen's sword skills are exceptional.]
 

 
[I don’t like that Tong Zhao has so many facets... if only she were like Mu Yingchen in real life...]
 

 
Fans who got to know Tong Zhao through "Heartless Tribulation" felt unsettled.
 

 
In the age of instinctive cinema, characters and actors are inseparable. Fans who got hooked after watching the show wouldn’t unfollow due to a significant gap with the actors; instead, they’d feel reassured by the consistency between on-screen and off-screen personas! But Tong Zhao was an exception—liking her felt like traditional fandom, with a clear separation between the character and the actress.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans quickly jumped in to say they were used to it.
 

 
[Oh, what's the big deal? Fans of Han Zhi's girlfriend are the real zen ones.]
 

 
[I suggest you check out Tong Zhao’s other works; every version of her is quite charming!]
 

 
Fans who loved Tong Zhao’s ethereal, cold demeanor were still quite conflicted.
 

 
This group cared a lot about Zhang Wenshi’s article, where he pointed out that Tong Zhao's performances would be fleeting, never to be seen again...
 

 
Never to be seen again? What should they do?
 

 
Just pay to watch it again!
 

 
Rewatching is basic; some even watched it three or four times.
 

 
However, besides core fans, most were drawn in by the big scenes.
 

 
A film good enough to warrant a rewatch certainly has lasting appeal.
 

 
No matter how jealous peers were, no matter how hard it was to accept, "Heartless Tribulation" still dominated the box office, creating a significant gap with the second and third-place films. Song Wanzhuo's manager stopped mentioning Tong Zhao, instead praising his insight in booking a duet with the box office goddess.
 

 
Wanzhuo felt a bit discontent.
 

 
He understood "Heartless Tribulation" fans all too well.
 

 
Why couldn't Tong Zhao be as enchanting as in "Emperor Ming"?
 

 
He felt the same way.
 

 
Perhaps it was the editing by Shi Qianqiu that triggered this reaction. Bilibili's talented UP creators, unwilling to fall behind Shi, began to take action.
 

 
Other UP creators had to admire Shi Qianqiu; his angle of “Tong Zhao in different works—self-reliant yet vulnerable” generated the highest buzz. Collaborating with other male leads didn’t compare to this theme, and there were plenty of editing opportunities.
 

 
And since it has an ancient backdrop, the hottest pairing is...
 

 
Immortal Master X Imperial Concubine.
# Chapter65
How did these two end up together?
 

 
Viewers who have watched this TV series and the movie may feel puzzled. In "The Legend of Emperor Ming," the favored consort has always ignored same-sex affections. Although part of this is due to the assumption that same-sex individuals in the harem are competitors, it is true that the consort has never shown tenderness towards women.
 

 
Mu Yingchen is a character who is completely the opposite.
 

 
She is exceptionally gentle with girls and shows no interest in men.
 

 
Even when treating her male disciples, her kindness is limited to not drawing her sword...
 

 
In "The Heartless Tribulation," there is a segment questioning Yingchen Fairy about only accepting female disciples, highlighting her obvious favoritism towards them.
 

 
Mu Yingchen coldly replied:
 

 
"Isn't the favoritism that men receive in this world enough? Family businesses, ancestral lines, and achievements are all inherited by men. In the mortal realm, respect is given to the ruler, the father, and the husband. Given that they enjoy so many benefits yet still feel insufficient, they cannot tolerate my favoritism towards women and come to dispute it with the term 'fairness'? My actions do not require outside opinions. If you have anything to say, take it up with my sword."
 

 
The hall fell silent immediately.
 

 
Who would dare take on her sword and then talk about fairness?
 

 
So no one dared to speak.
 

 
If we must talk about the commonalities between the two, it’s that they are both domineering, portrayed by the same actress, and are both female.
 

 
No matter how hard you think about it, you just can’t understand how they got paired together.
 

 
It’s okay not to understand.
 

 
Perhaps those in the know might not get it, but many fans take pride in creating a shipping vibe between two people who had no connection, watching the audience evolve from “Wait, how is this possible?” to “Once I accepted this pairing, it’s actually kind of cute,” and finally to “What is this random pairing? This AE is real!”...
 

 
Among them, the thrill of distorting facts and manipulating hearts is like a god holding great power.
 

 
Once the first shipper video hit the charts, other shippers eagerly followed suit—
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Correct Way to Open the Palace and Immortal Realm”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Girls She Loved Were Fake”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Wind Rises”
 

 
It’s like the classic scene of Bucky falling from a train off a cliff, frequently used in Marvel edits; this couple also has a scene that gets recycled over and over—
 

 
Coincidentally, the luxurious palanquin that the female supporting character Li Qiaoqiao rides in "The Heartless Tribulation" shares the same modeling code as the one used for the favored consort in "The Legend of Emperor Ming" when she is brought into the palace. The production team didn’t think much of it; they simply bought a set for the popular data and that was it, which resulted in solid evidence that “this cross-drama couple is real.”
 

 
Thus, with injuries all over and looking utterly disheveled, Mu Yingchen leans against the tree once again, only daring to silently gaze at the magnificent palanquin on the main path, inside of which sits the girl she loves, about to be taken into the imperial palace...
 

 
Meanwhile, the actress playing Li Qiaoqiao, Ding Jiao, tweeted a complaint.
 

 
@DingJiaoV:
 

 
I shouldn’t be inside the palanquin; I should be underneath it.
 

 
[Mu Fei CP Screenshot]
 

 
The comments below are hilarious.
 

 
[Poor sister became a tool/dog head emoji]
 

 
[I’ve really been brainwashed by these edits and have rewatched “The Heartless Tribulation” three times, always wanting to see where the favored consort is...]
 

 
[Mu Fei Szd!!! I recommend everyone to watch “[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears,” the lyrics fit perfectly; it’s so heartbreaking!]
 

 
“[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears”
 

 
This video topped the Bilibili film and television editing hot list, ranking fourth overall, showing just how many netizens it touched.
 

 
Due to the numerous close-ups of their one-sided conversations, they edited it into a shippy dialogue.
 

 
—You gaze at the horizon, I gaze at your face [Note 1]
 

 
In the masterful editing of the canola flower creator, the favored consort says, “This dance, the person I wanted to perform it for is no longer here.” It’s actually about her regretful sister, the queen, but it was interpreted as referring to Mu Yingchen.
 

 
Mu Yingchen once danced with a sword on the Sword Peak, accompanied by the favored consort playing the guzheng for the emperor.
 

 
When the background music changes, it feels like one person plays the zither while the other dances.
 

 
Favored Consort: “I want the riches of this world.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen: “Wealth and power are nothing but dust.”
 

 
There’s a close-up of Mu Yingchen holding her sword, her cold voice stating, “My golden core has been shattered, and my spiritual power is nearly depleted; today is my day to die.”
 

 
“I’ve come to seek justice for myself, to settle the past grievances.”
 

 
After saying this, she strikes down with her sword.
 

 
This section cuts from some unfortunate period drama where the palace gets destroyed.
 

 
Next is the scene where the favored consort coughs up blood and dies in the emperor's embrace.
 

 
A close-up of Mu Yingchen's astonished expression follows.
 

 
A tear falls from the favored consort’s eye, sliding down her delicate cheek.
 

 
—Your tears are not the only thing teetering on the edge.
 

 
—The mocking wind sings a farewell. [Note 2]
 

 
Here begins a series of hard cuts showcasing memories, accompanied by suggestive lines that could easily confuse viewers who haven't seen the original version:
 

 
Favored Consort: “The first time I saw her, I thought to myself, how could there be such a woman in the world? She is beautiful and noble, has a good background, and the man she marries is…” Her voice trails off, a hint of mockery evident in her tone.
 

 
It transitions to Mu Yingchen’s debut at the Dao Companion Ceremony, dressed in white, untainted by dust.
 

 
The creator who used “A Thousand Years of Tears” as background music has a dirty mind. At the end, they splice in the “Sea King Kill” along with the real-life “Tong Zhao,” crafting a yuri version of their reunion a thousand years later. This edit is much easier since Tong Zhao has recently become popular due to Mu Yingchen’s role, and during promotional events, she would pose with a cold expression that matched everyone’s imagination, thus…
 

 
Cold and aloof actress X manipulative green tea, modern CP is now a thing.
 

 
“The rise of the Mu Fei CP, and the biggest victim should be my brother, Wan Zhuo.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really has it hard.
 

 
He was dragged out to be beaten down again.
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a duet for the New Year’s Eve party? Considering the timing, it was about right, so he posted on Weibo again, cueing Tong Zhao. The tone was very businesslike, almost bureaucratic, clearly written by his agent. However, the comments section completely backfired.
 

 
[Break up my Mu Fei CP, the dog emperor, come out and face death!]
 

 
[But I want to see the consort and Mu Yingchen sing love songs together. How about you take responsibility for playing the guzheng, Your Majesty?]
 

 
This comment immediately sparked a rebuttal from Wanzhuo's fans: [No way, our brother can only play the electric guitar. Can Yingchen rock out?]
 

 
Although Tong Zhao and Song Wanzhuo had a very casual friendship, they maintained ongoing collaborations in public.
 

 
Their relationship was known to be pretty good, and when others commented on it like this, fans would inevitably start arguing.
 

 
The new generation of young stars were all avid surfers on the internet, and Song Wanzhuo was no exception. He loved browsing Bilibili to watch video edits. During the middle of “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” the romantic plot between the dog emperor and the favored consort sparked a wave of videos, and he had saved a special compilation of moments with his goddess in his favorites.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo complained to Tong Zhao on WeChat: [Why am I the dog emperor again? I clearly pamper you!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Because in the fan edits, you killed the favored consort.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was taken aback: [Why would I kill my beloved consort?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The plot needs a villain; just accept your fate.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [I must be the most resentful person regarding this CP in the world.]
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and wanted to say, “No, you’re not.”
 

 
The most resentful person in her mind was—
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Help! Spare me, even if all the men in the world die, I will never have the thought of being with her!]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [If I have committed any offenses, the palace rules would punish me, not let me see this kind of thing.]
 

 
Concubine Chen’s intense output: [Even if I were paired with He Shun, at least that would make sense. Have we ever appeared together? It’s impossible. Let go of that thought; the person edited in is not me at all.]
 

 
Duan Ge (brother) accurately strikes: [You guys are serious.]
 

 
[Back in the palace, could the palace rules do anything to you?] Lu Yingchen said coolly, with a tone full of exhaustion from seeing the fickleness of the world: [It’s quite nice; finally, there’s something that can sanction you, the calamity-bringing concubine.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I really enjoy watching these videos. I didn’t expect that we could have this side in the eyes of the audience. They all praise your portrayal of Mu Yingchen as the most ethereal cultivator! In “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” you were a flower of wealth and nobility, but in “The Heartless Tribulation,” you have that disenchanted look that seems above the mundane.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [What disenchanted look? I see her as a retired security guard.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...Pfft.”
 

 
“What’s wrong?” The manager, who was discussing the variety show details with Tong Zhao, looked over with concern as she suddenly burst into laughter.
 

 
Tong Zhao covered her mouth with her hand and pulled out a versatile reply: “I just thought of something happy.”
 

 
She really couldn’t help it; she wanted to laugh out loud.
 

 
“Seeing you laugh makes me happy too,” Sister Chu said. “Come and take a look at the flying guest spoilers prepared by the production team.”
 

 
@OneLifeSurvivor:
 

 
#OneLifeSurvivor# Guess who the flying guest is for the next episode.
 

 
[Silhouette]
 

 
The figure in the silhouette is tall, and the long sword at their waist is a recognizable feature.
 

 
At first, no one recognized it as Tong Zhao; they didn't dare to guess it was her. She has been quite popular lately. Would she really come to this kind of grueling variety show? It seemed unnecessary for her to participate; it would be much more comfortable to join lighthearted shows filled with food, drink, and entertainment while still maintaining her fanbase.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans often say that their idol works too hard and hope her manager can arrange some easier gigs for her.
 

 
“Stop scheduling activities that involve losing limbs or digging for bullets all the time.”
 

 
The manager felt quite wronged.
 

 
After the spoiler tweet was posted for a while, some sharp-eyed netizens thought the silhouette looked familiar. They compared it with screenshots from "The Heartless Tribulation," and surprisingly, they lined up perfectly. This netizen posted the comparison in the comments, and it was quickly shared on forums. Other netizens were skeptical but also felt there was some logic to it—
 

 
[Not to mention, this variety show really has that girl’s style.]
 

 
[Fan: My heart aches for my sister QAQ. Tong Zhao: Is there any other way to torture me? Hurry up.]
 

 
[#The last female celebrity who doesn't need fans to feel sorry for her#]
 

 
[What is she doing on this variety show? If she goes, is there still a way for others to survive?]
 

 
"In One Life Survives," there are twenty contestants each episode.
 

 
They form groups of four and must survive on a deserted island for fifteen days. They face not only the challenges of hunger and thirst but also the potential dangers from wild animals. The production team will periodically drop limited supplies to encourage conflict and competition among the teams, leading to mutual elimination.
 

 
It’s essentially a real-life, team-based version of PUBG.
 

 
If a guest is attacked by a beast, there will be a struggle period. If there are no teammates to defeat the beast or escape successfully, the system will directly determine them as dead, without any additional physical pain or gruesome scenes of being bitten.
 

 
The firearms issued have real lethal force when hitting wild animals, but when they hit other contestants, they are simply paintballs. Depending on the area hit, there will be corresponding negative effects—for example, if a contestant is hit in the knee by a paintball, they won’t feel any pain aside from a slight jolt, but they will be deemed hit and thus unable to move that leg.
 

 
Therefore, aiming for the legs to incapacitate them is a viable strategy in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
After the holographic technology matured, this type of survival variety show sprang up like mushrooms after rain.
 

 
However, there aren't many stars willing to participate, especially idols.
 

 
Those who are delicate and precious will get teary-eyed with just a slight bump; if they endure even a little hardship, they’ll buy marketing campaigns to maintain their image. Participating in such a variety show would be self-inflicted suffering and ruin their reputation. Fans also don’t want to see them suffer, so this type of show is generally reserved for tough-guy male stars, who can come in, dominate the competition, and immediately gain a large male audience's favor.
 

 
Long Jue, the top rising star, became an instant sensation in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
Originally a young man working on a construction site while dealing with family debt, Long Jue had trained in martial arts before his family fell on hard times. He stepped in at the last minute for a missing contestant due to illness. His ability to endure hardship and fight was fully displayed on the show, particularly in a scene where he was wearing a black tank top, washing off sweat and blood under a waterfall, which left countless viewers breathless.
 

 
His chest and biceps were incredibly impressive.
 

 
When he dove into the water and raised his head, slicking his hair back, his handsome and strong face caught the audience's attention, revealing him as a hidden gem. After the show ended, he was immediately signed by an entertainment company, and his experience on "In One Life Survives" made him successful during auditions for tough-guy roles.
 

 
[Those who got into "Countdown 72 Hours" are really looking forward to seeing Tong Zhao's strong "true self" again.]
 

 
[72 Hours 1]
 

 
Tong Zhao's strong subconscious is evident in "Countdown 72 Hours."
 

 
Initially, netizens were quite surprised that a rising female star would be willing to participate in a survival variety show. As discussions went on, they began to feel excited about it, though there were also male users on a male-dominated forum who were openly mocking her—
 

 
“Seriously, are there really female stars who think they can thrive in a survival variety show?”
 

 
“Friendly reminder: in a survival variety show, no one gets special treatment like in movies.”
 

 
“Click to see confident comments from Chinese female fans.”
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has had a group of male haters.
 

 
Her PR team and manager analyzed that it's mostly born from love turning to hate.
 

 
The character she portrayed, the imperial concubine, can be considered a heartthrob killer, attracting a significant number of male fans. Many on that forum refer to her as their wife, believing that having her makes them feel like emperors. Given that the survival genre often depicts a character's journey from being a newcomer to facing life-changing experiences...
 

 
Tong Zhao has chosen to play Feng Yanqi.
 

 
Her portrayal of a cold and fierce woman shattered some male fans' delicate hearts.
 

 
At first, they criticized her manager for taking on too many roles.
 

 
But when they realized Tong Zhao was willingly accepting these roles, they felt she wasn't listening to advice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's patriarchal mindset reflects the sentiments of many men—
 

 
You have to listen to me; I understand a lot, and I am the truth of the world. If you don’t listen to me, something bad will happen.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t run into trouble; instead, everything she acted in became a hit, and her new film ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had a great box office success, showcasing a cold demeanor that didn’t rely on men.
 

 
This instantly triggered those male fans, turning them into die-hard haters, hoping she would fail.
 

 
Seeing her take on a highly challenging role in the male-dominated survival variety show In ‘One Life Survives’, they immediately got excited. On one hand, they felt their masculinity was being insulted, while on the other, they were relieved that she dared to take on anything, giving them a chance to mock her.
 

 
"Rational Discussion: What Gave Tong Zhao the Confidence to Venture into Survival Variety Shows?"
 

 
Original poster:
 

 
“From randomly taking on post-apocalyptic films to hitting it big, someone has tasted the sweet fruit of a fierce woman image. After listening to her fans' uncritical praise, she feels like she can take on five at once, forgetting how she got here—wasn’t it by flattering men as the imperial concubine?
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao makes me think of those soft support girls I encounter when I’m playing ranked matches...
 

 
Getting carried to diamond rank by the wild king brother and occasionally winning MVP, they start to think they’re really at that level.
 

 
It’s not that I’m misogynistic; let’s let the data speak.
 

 
Survival variety shows generally lack female guests; even if they go, they’re just dragging everyone down. Tong Zhao’s fans shouldn’t be too quick to curse me. Your sister has such a beautiful face; do you really want to see her ruin her image? Isn’t it better for her to be a beautiful little fairy or a little princess? She could do great in shows like ‘Sea King Kill’.”
 

 
The provocative original post, which wore the guise of a rational discussion, quickly became a hot thread that represented the mainstream voice of this forum.
 

 
At first glance, it seemed to make a lot of sense.
 

 
Tong Zhao is indeed beautiful, and some fans hope she maintains a delicate and beautiful image, participating in leisurely and fun variety shows.
 

 
The original poster felt that their comments were quite reasonable.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans, unable to accept this, were labeled as mindless defenders who couldn’t grasp the situation.
 

 
Data analysis also showed that after Tong Zhao took on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, the male percentage in her fan base slightly decreased.
 

 
However, some male users held a different opinion: “I admire Tong Zhao for being willing to take on various challenging roles, which is why I became her fan. Why do you insist on demanding that an independent and strong woman fit your idea of a delicate flower?”
 

 
The same argument had different responses in different places.
 

 
On Weibo, Tong Zhao, who severed her father-daughter relationship, was met with sympathy from netizens.
 

 
The mainstream opinion felt she was strong, unaffected by her weak mother, and impressively independent.
 

 
On the cat forum, however, this was seen as a black mark against her.
 

 
There were plenty of posts expressing that if their daughter were a fan of Tong Zhao, they would break her legs to stop her from emulating an idol who easily disowns her father like an ungrateful wolf.
 

 
Bias often shapes perception; one's position determines their thoughts.
 

 
This topic intensified, fueled by some who wanted to bring Tong Zhao down, creating a spectacle for their competitors while causing more trouble, spreading to Weibo.
 

 
They claimed that fans were resisting Tong Zhao appearing on ‘In One Life Survives’.
 

 
The fans looked completely bewildered.
 

 
They immediately went to check the original post that was shared and felt even more wronged than Dou E.
 

 
[... We don't want Zhao Zhao to suffer, but we never thought of her like that!]
 

 
[Please, straight male cancer, if you can’t handle a female actress being tough, don’t drag us into it, okay?]
 

 
[I’m a male fan, and I feel really wronged; I suggest removing this brain-dead person from the male ranks.]
 

 
[Ugh, I can’t take it. I really hope Tong Zhao survives until the end and slaps those self-confident boys in the face.]
 

 
Normal male fans felt unjustly treated and couldn’t understand this group’s mindset.
 

 
In ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, Tong Zhao was indeed fierce, yet she remained beautiful; when she was shooting with the gun, she was undeniably sexy—especially for otaku who loved mobile games like ‘Girls' Frontline’, who all referred to her as the gun girl of their dreams, feeling as if she had stepped out of the 2D world as a Valkyrie.
 

 
Different strokes for different folks.
 

 
But these haters didn’t feel the same way; they adored Tong Zhao’s performance in ‘Emperor Ming’ and believed she had gone astray, criticizing her for her own good. Couldn’t the fans see how many boyfriend fans she had when she performed in ‘Emperor Ming’?
 

 
For these haters, seeing Tong Zhao was like watching their delicate wives go to work as a strong woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were infuriated, but looking at the data…
 

 
It seemed that survival variety shows really had very few female guests!
 

 
And even fewer had outstanding performances.
 

 
However, some fans countered with solid arguments—
 

 
Although the physical fitness of female guests may be lacking, their emotional stability is quite high, unlike what some male netizens say about them easily breaking down. They also move very cautiously and carefully. There was a winning team that managed to survive because one female guest remembered to erase their traces in the jungle.
 

 
Haters:
 

 
[Oh, so your sister plans to survive by avoiding confrontation?]
 

 
[Then we’re not wrong; she might as well go to a relaxing variety show where she can shine. If she spends the whole time avoiding confrontation without getting a single shot, isn’t that just a waste of time? How long is a female actor’s golden period? Isn’t it a waste for her to spend it avoiding confrontation like a coward?]
 

 
...
 

 
It seems there’s some truth to that.
 

 
Some more influential fan leaders advised fans not to get too worked up. If someone made a claim like, “Tong Zhao will lead the team to victory in the variety show,” and a screenshot was taken by someone with ill intentions, only for her not to deliver in the end, that would be quite embarrassing.
 

 
Isn’t it unfair to raise expectations for sister?
 

 
Don’t give the haters attention; let them go crazy. Zhao Zhao is a woman they can never have.
 

 
With such a big uproar, Tong Zhao naturally knew about it.
 

 
The production team was thrilled; the natural buzz surrounding her made other variety shows that didn’t invite Tong Zhao jealous. Some with darker minds were already hoping she wouldn’t perform as well as the haters claimed.
 

 
The female journalist humorously commented: “Is this the power of the national disaster beauty? Little Chen should reflect on this.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke more harshly than the fans defending Tong Zhao against the haters: “All I can say is that there have always been such fools in every era. They don’t consider that if it were an era of imperial authority, my beauty would be something they could only covet. Everyone thinks they could be the emperor; I should be their beloved concubine. But if we were to dream back to ancient times, their only chance to interact with me would be to enter the palace as eunuchs.”
 

 
Tong Zhao found it hilarious and was in a great mood.
 

 
No one could ruin her mindset; it was all related to her.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Alright, don’t be upset. I’ll find a way to support you.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I’m not upset; men can’t get to me. The only one who can truly anger me is that cultivator.”
 

 
Female journalist: “Do you know how many people are going to comment ‘I’m shipping this’ after you say that?”
 

 
With Duan Ge backing her up, Concubine Chen was happy again.
 

 
Duan Ge: “As long as you’re not angry, that’s good. But I’m a little upset.”
 

 
Online, some of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t stand the backlash and secretly sent her encouraging messages in private and comments, hoping she could lead her teammates to victory and slap the haters in the face. In situations like this, the best response is not to engage, and the fans understood that.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s response shattered their hopes—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
“I’m sorry, but it’s impossible to lead my teammates to victory in #OneSurvives#.”
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[Why is sister saying such pessimistic things????]
 

 
Just as the haters were about to celebrate, the production team of “One Survives” retweeted.
 

 
@OneSurvives v:
 

 
“Because @Sister Tong Zhao is serving as the hunter for this episode of survival!”
 

 
An external trial officer for a group of twenty.
 

 
Unlike other teams that can muddle through to victory, the hunter's only winning condition is to eliminate everyone. They have no teammates, and for every person they eliminate, they receive supplies for one day. Theoretically, there’s no need to search for food; they only need to find people.
 

 
Lead teammates to victory?
 

 
Impossible, because Tong Zhao has no teammates.
 

 
Both the haters and the fans were stunned.
# Chapter66
“Did you hear that Tong Zhao is coming? Is it true?”
 

 
“It’s true; it’s already officially announced.”
 

 
“I heard she was only supposed to come for two days, but then it changed. Who knows what she’s after.”
 

 
“Then we have to help her out, right?”
 

 
At the filming site of ‘OneLifeSurvivor’, three ordinary guests huddled in a corner, discussing quietly.
 

 
Even with a 24-hour survival show, there’s still some room for behind-the-scenes manipulation.
 

 
It’s just much less than traditional variety shows.
 

 
In survival-type shows, if a certain guest's physical capabilities are enhanced—like when everyone is getting rained on and drinking raw water—only that guest won’t suffer from headaches or fevers. Or if the same food supplies are available, one specific guest might feel fuller than the others, giving them an invisible advantage.
 

 
However, the audience for survival shows seeks a sense of realism, so such behind-the-scenes interference is rare...
 

 
Or rather, it’s very well-kept secret, with few leaks.
 

 
“Who knows?”
 

 
When Tong Zhao was mentioned, the two shrugged dismissively, and one added, “Director Chen wouldn’t dare to go too far. If the complaint rate exceeds 40%, the backend data has to be made public. The show’s ratings are good; why would they ruin their reputation for a publicity-seeking female star?”
 

 
The remaining person looked a bit embarrassed: “I actually like Tong Zhao, so don’t say that about her.”
 

 
“Why do you like her? Is she going to ruin your own rice bowl?”
 

 
...
 

 
As soon as the words left their mouths, Director Chen walked in through the door.
 

 
He was no longer the aloof figure he usually presented to his subordinates; instead, he wore a smile on his face. “I can’t feel at ease for even a moment when I don’t see anyone.”
 

 
Walking beside Director Chen was a tall, slender woman.
 

 
“I’ve always been on time.”
 

 
Her voice was a bit cold. Dressed in sporty casual clothes with sneakers and a baseball cap, she wore an outfit that, while suitable for sweating it out on the sports field and not showing off her figure, made it clear that she had model-like proportions with her long legs. Even if she wore a burlap sack, she could easily be ready to strut down a runway.
 

 
When people see a good figure, they can’t help but imagine she must be beautiful.
 

 
When she took off her black cat-ear hat, the other guests couldn’t help but have their hearts skip a beat.
 

 
It was really Tong Zhao!
 

 
They had known for a while that a very beautiful female star would be coming today—the recent splash screen advertisement on Weibo was for ‘Heartless Tribulation’, and with Tong Zhao’s rising popularity, anyone in the film industry, even a temporary actor, couldn’t possibly have not heard of her or seen her photos.
 

 
These guests, who often frequented the film city, had long been accustomed to handsome men and beautiful women.
 

 
To stand out among so many attractive faces, Tong Zhao’s looks had to be remarkable.
 

 
The guests who had been whispering and speaking dismissively about her fell silent in unison, turning their attention to her with respect.
 

 
The smile at the corners of her lips was faint.
 

 
Director Chen wanted to say something else to her but couldn’t think of a topic, so he moved aside to put on the protective gear provided on-site—knee pads, elbow protectors, and fingerless gloves.
 

 
The film city, primarily focused on survival variety shows, was built on the outskirts, encompassing a large area.
 

 
This setup was intended to ensure that when the guests took breaks from the cabin, there wouldn't be a significant environmental contrast that could cause psychological discrepancies. After waking up in the cabin, they would still see green mountains and clear waters outside their dormitory windows, accompanied by the sounds of birds and the fragrance of flowers. The location rented for ‘One Life Survivor’ included a site for artificial off-road challenges, where a warm-up activity would be conducted before filming, allowing the audience to observe the physical fitness levels of the guests in real life.
 

 
There was no way to alter the backend data in reality!
 

 
Director Chen really dared to go this far.
 

 
The crowd couldn't help but steal a few more glances at Tong Zhao.
 

 
After she skillfully donned the protective gear, she began to stretch and warm up in place.
 

 
"She looks pretty serious."
 

 
Guest No. 7 muttered.
 

 
"Maybe she really has some skills; otherwise, why would she dare to come? If she shows off a bit during the warm-up, it would make sense to alter the data later," another seasoned guest, often seen on survival variety shows, whispered. Her black knee pads accentuated her long legs, which looked snow-white and delicate, making him swallow hard.
 

 
While the other guests quietly gossiped about Tong Zhao, she was completely oblivious.
 

 
After all, the noise in her mind was loud enough.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “There are so many men here!”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Are you happy?”
 

 
Lu Yingchen: “I wake up in a place like this…”
 

 
Lu Yingchen couldn't hide his disgust and wanted to clear the place with a single sword stroke.
 

 
“Happy my ass! It’s infuriating! I shouldn’t have come to this place; it’s an insult to my eyes,”
 
Concubine Chen said, fanning herself with a peacock-feather fan, covering half of her beautiful face. “Let me reiterate, I only accept the best men in the world. Not just any good, definitely not mediocre—only the best will do.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke with an arrogance born from being spoiled.
 

 
She wasn’t targeting anyone in particular; she considered all the men present to be trash.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted Lu Yingchen: “Why don’t you rest a bit longer? Duan Ge (brother) will cover for you here.”
 

 
They had previously considered who should participate in the survival variety show.
 

 
After all, Lu Yingchen’s outdoor survival skills were quite strong; she had lived in the jungle for a long time before restoring her cultivation, much like a monk in training. She had done all sorts of exaggerated things often seen in anime, like meditating under a waterfall and challenging wild black bears—her ethereal aura had come later.
 

 
If she lacked capability, how could she remain untarnished?
 

 
But later, upon looking up the guests for the survival show, Tong Zhao knew that there would be many men. She was aware that Lu Yingchen didn’t like this kind of environment. Even if she said she could handle it, it didn’t matter; she wouldn’t be willing to.
 

 
If she didn’t cherish her own character, who would cherish it for her?
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been the one who valued herself the most.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t speak. She had been unhappy ever since the negative comments about Lu Yingchen started circulating online.
 

 
One, she felt pity for Concubine Chen being coveted by a group of lowly people.
 

 
Thinking about it, the haters who favor Concubine Chen and resist Tong Zhao's participation in other roles are really trying to sow discord between their different personalities. To put it bluntly, it’s like demanding that a girlfriend or daughter be virtuous and gentle, molding them into what they want like clay, erasing any aspect they dislike.
 

 
They love her for being delicate and charming but hate her for being strong and fierce.
 

 
And they never consider that both the delicate and the strong sides are just facets of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Do they want Tong Zhao to erase some of her traits just to please them?
 

 
That's impossible. Not only will she not give them the satisfaction, but she will also continue to walk her own path.
 

 
Additionally, due to being immersed in a war-torn apocalypse, Duan Ge's hostility is heavier than that of other personalities, and it’s impossible for her to vent her anger at her sisters during this survival variety show. Tong Zhao agreed to change her participation from two days to one episode for this reason—both the production team and she felt they were leveraging each other, achieving a win-win situation.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Well, I’m going to sleep now. Wake me up when you’re done having fun with the body.”
 

 
Duan Ge chuckled lightly and replied, “Okay.”
 

 
……
 

 
"One Life Survivor" is a live-streamed variety show.
 

 
Similar to "Countdown 72 Hours," it has both post-edited versions and 24-hour live broadcasts.
 

 
The warm-up activity consists of a four-person group completing an obstacle course challenge.
 

 
The first task is a basic 1,000-meter run on grass, followed by climbing an artificial rock wall, a short hurdle race, crossing an artificial lake, completing a rope net climb, and then facing various minor challenges, finishing with a 200-meter swim…
 

 
The shorter the time it takes to complete, the better the score.
 

 
Of course, if someone can’t finish, there’s no need to force themselves; they can withdraw partway and still participate in subsequent segments of the variety show.
 

 
The show itself has decent popularity, and with Tong Zhao joining this episode, the viewership for the warm-up activities has already reached six figures and is continuing to rise. This is also why the show has chosen to have Tong Zhao make her appearance last… They’re worried that once she completes her challenge, the audience will leave, so they’re keeping her as a highlight to hold the viewers' attention.
 

 
[Where’s Tong Zhao? When is she coming out? I came to see her.]
 

 
[Why hasn’t she shown up yet?]
 

 
[I suggest we fast-forward to Tong Zhao’s appearance!!!]
 

 
[Wow, there are really so few female guests, I’m a bit worried about Zhao Zhao QAQ]
 

 
The frequency data of keywords in the comments clearly demonstrates Tong Zhao's commercial value.
 

 
Regardless of the evaluations, netizens are simply curious about her.
 

 
Actors often repeat the same type of roles, just like an author who only writes one genre. While this can stabilize their fan base and provide a steady income, it can also lead to fatigue—it's difficult to keep all audiences consistently engaged in the same tone over a long period. However, as long as they handle this well, they can earn significant wealth.
 

 
Tong Zhao changes her style with every film she makes; some people criticize her for being too unconventional, but one has to admit that this is also a way to maintain freshness.
 

 
……
 

 
At this moment, the crew member came over to call her: “Sister Zhao, it’s almost your turn.”
 

 
The host smiled at the camera and encouraged Tong Zhao:
 

 
“If you feel like you can’t hold on anymore, you can immediately press the emergency button on your watch, and a medical team will come to take you for a rest. Remember to know your limits, okay, miss?”
 

 
Prior to this, he had added Tong Zhao on WeChat and greeted her, saying he would make some provocative comments for the sake of the show’s effect.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood immediately.
 

 
Of course, the production team was racking their brains for explosive moments, and the host was just a worker; she wouldn’t make things difficult for him. She simply replied that she understood and told him to say whatever he wanted, but her fans might go after him, so he had to be careful.
 

 
[If the host can’t speak properly, he should just shut up.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's fans are getting anxious? Advising her to know her limits is for her own good? Got it, some people’s fans are all elementary school kids who don’t understand kind advice.]
 

 
[Even though I think what the host said was unpleasant, I also hope the sister knows her limits. There are male guests ahead who are exhausted and can’t complete the tasks; there’s no need to push herself...]
 

 
The comments were buzzing, and a debate erupted.
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her eyelids and glanced at him.
 

 
That dark and silent glance cast a chilling and deadly aura over her beautifully shaped eyes.
 

 
The host's smiling face froze.
 

 
Humans are all part of the same species, yet there are a hundred different types. A student standing in front of their teacher will behave obediently under a gaze, while a fugitive will have their heart race at just a glance from someone in a police uniform. There is a theory of mutual suppression between people; herbivores will never get to eat meat in their lifetimes. Just putting on a wolf's skin won’t change that.
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really that intimidating?
 

 
The host felt dazed by her gaze, like a noisy sheep being caught by a disgruntled tiger ready to bite into its carotid artery, contemplating whether to give it a quick end.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
Duan Ge, a beat behind, flipped through Tong Zhao's memories to find their WeChat chat records, remembering that this person was only speaking oddly for work purposes…
 

 
The fierce aura that seemed to be ready to devour someone suddenly froze.
 

 
It was as if the sharp teeth of a wild beast were pressing against her skin but had stopped their advance.
 

 
The eyes that had been shrouded in hostility cleared slightly, as if the clouds had parted.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
These three words were spoken with the same coldness as “Get lost and stop bothering me.”
 

 
“Okay, okay! Good luck, miss!”
 

 
The host, who had originally prepared a barrage of strange remarks, dared not utter another word and obediently retreated.
 

 
The challenge involved completing the obstacle course in groups of four, and the first five groups had already finished.
 

 
The best time was 10 minutes and 07 seconds, achieved by a male guest, number 16, who usually trained in long-distance running and looked like a potential star athlete.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the final contestant, and there would be solo camera shots of her throughout.
 

 
Several guests who dreamed of standing out in the survival variety show and joining the ranks of celebrities cast envious and jealous glances at her as she stood at the starting line. The various complex gazes seemed to pierce into her, but unfortunately, she stood too far forward for them to look her in the eye—
 

 
And Duan Ge would never look back.
 

 
“Get in position,”
 

 
“Ready—”
 

 
[Tong Zhao, go!]
 

 
[That figure is incredible! When she crouches in the starting position, her legs have muscle! How come I never noticed this before? She looks so good; I want to be squeezed to death by her thighs.] After this comment was posted, the fan who clicked on it angrily found out it was from a girl, so it was all good.
 

 
As the gun fired, her slender figure shot out like an arrow.
 

 
This body was a bit more delicate than the one Duan Ge used during the apocalypse, but Tong Zhao had consistently practiced her cultivation techniques since returning, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. This not only made her skin and overall condition nearly perfect but also strengthened her physique. She didn’t pursue a fragile “ideal body”; she had all the muscles she needed, and now was the time to put them to use.
 

 
If it came down to physical ability, Tong Zhao’s body was not much worse than that of a male athlete.
 

 
Duan Ge was also a good runner.
 

 
She understood exactly when to sprint in a kilometer, when to pace herself, and how to regulate her breathing.
 

 
This wasn’t something learned from a gym teacher.
 

 
It was experience gained from being chased by zombies; different paths led to the same destination.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team could be considered humane.
 

 
The afternoon sun was abundant, not scorching enough to make one feel dizzy. The light fell on Duan Ge as she ran on the track, like a layer of golden powder laid over her fair skin, dazzling to the eyes. This scene put many of her fans at ease.
 

 
A strong sister is certainly impressive.
 

 
However, beauty fans are quite real; they love that face and hope their idol looks beautiful in everything she does. They fear seeing her unflattering moments and unfollowing her—this group is common and is like those online who shout, “You can trick me with a fake photo, but please don’t scare me with a real selfie.”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao looking so beautiful during high-intensity exercise reassured her beauty fans!
 

 
[Mom asked why my screen is wet.]
 

 
[? GHS?]
 

 
[It's because I couldn't help but lick the screen when I saw the beautiful sister!]
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t think about the effect of the show.
 

 
She had never been a star; at most, she would remember that she was an artist now and should pay attention to her image. But deliberately running beautifully? That was impossible. Her thinking was very practical; the reason she looked good was simply that she was too comfortable and effortless.
 

 
This cross-country challenge was not just a test of physical ability but also the difficulty of switching between various activities.
 

 
One moment she had to run, the next she had to climb a wall, then hurdle, and then swim...
 

 
But for someone who had survived in the apocalypse, wasn’t this quite normal?
 

 
She didn’t even have to turn back to shoot zombies.
 

 
Watching Duan Ge complete the challenge, it was hard for not just the onlookers but even her fans to feel anxious.
 

 
They had initially been quite worried about her.
 

 
As a result, after watching for a while, they completely forgot their nerves and started admiring her beauty.
 

 
A significant portion of her fans had a strong admiration for strength. Tong Zhao's fanbase mainly consisted of career-oriented supporters, which was even more of a group that idolized strength. Watching their sister complete the challenge effortlessly and gracefully filled them with pride.
 

 
"Whoosh!"
 

 
When Duan Ge reached the finish line, the recorded completion time on screen was 10 minutes and 17 seconds.
 

 
That was only 10 seconds slower than the first place.
 

 
That was already incredible.
 

 
After all, the physical differences between men and women are objective and not discriminatory. Sports exams have different standards for men and women; if a unified standard were applied, it would be a form of invisible discrimination.
 

 
After swimming the two hundred meters, Duan Ge pressed her hands against the edge of the pool, pushing her upper body out of the water.
 

 
To facilitate movement, she had her hair tied up in a high ponytail today, which now hung down her back, wet and resembling a soft whip. Duan Ge was dressed quite conservatively and knew she would be entering the water, so she wore materials that wouldn’t become transparent when wet, showcasing the elegant lines of her shoulder blades. She looked like a dragon leaping from the surface of the water, embodying the cold and noble dragon maiden imagined by the people of China.
 

 
[...I’m dead. Thank you, production team, for arranging the wet segment!]
 

 
[Someone is desperately requesting Tong Zhao to play the princess of the Dragon Palace in the East Sea.]
 

 
[Princess? This is clearly a queen!]
 

 
This was the beauty fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Onlookers, especially those who loved survival variety shows, were shocked by Tong Zhao's performance.
 

 
[Does looks matter? The real issue is that Tong Zhao’s speed is incredible!]
 

 
[Is this a river raccoon? This is clearly not a river raccoon! Can her muscle mass support such intense exercise?]
 

 
[...Shocking my entire gym.]
 

 
Some stubborn individuals insisted on recording this segment to time it with their own stopwatch, refusing to believe that Tong Zhao was that fast. Those less adamant began to make jokes—previously, Tong Zhao had been jokingly suggested by netizens to get her brain checked due to her unique subconscious; this time, it seemed like she needed a full physical examination as well.
 

 
What others thought didn’t concern Duan Ge, nor did she have any interest in knowing.
 

 
After leaving the swimming pool, an assistant immediately draped a towel over her shoulders and handed her a hot drink.
 

 
"Thank you."
 

 
Duan Ge turned and smiled at the young assistant.
 

 
She was as fierce with the male host as she was gentle with the female assistant.
 

 
"You're too polite, Sister Zhao."
 

 
The assistant quickly waved her hand, blushing as she stayed by Duan Ge's side, waiting for her to finish drinking before collecting the thermos cup. She didn’t understand what was happening; despite working with Tong Zhao every day, she found her especially charming at that moment. Just a simple thank-you made her heart race.
 

 
What’s going on?!
 

 
She was straight!
 

 
The assistant strongly reminded herself.
 

 
The assistant's racing heart wasn't an isolated phenomenon; nearly 70% of the comments in the live chat mentioned that they were charmed, with the remaining 30% being male viewers who were drawn in. Some had even started researching how to work alongside Tong Zhao, thinking that they could also fetch water and hand over towels! They wanted to hear their sister say thank you in person!
 

 
The other guests at the event had long since collapsed from exhaustion after completing the challenge.
 

 
Even if they couldn't lie down to rest immediately, most were doing gentle exercises to bring their heart rate and blood pressure back to normal levels.
 

 
The performance of other competitors during the guests’ commentary was also a major highlight of the show, so there was a huge screen on site displaying the live footage.
 

 
The contestants, who had originally been chatting aimlessly, all raised their heads to look at the big screen as Tong Zhao began her challenge.
 

 
At first, their curiosity was mixed with malice.
 

 
But the more they watched, the more they couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Tong Zhao might not be the fastest, but she definitely ran the most gracefully.
 

 
Everyone found it hard to believe that she could run so effortlessly, especially since they had all just completed challenges that they knew were exhausting—while they had anticipated that the tests would challenge their stamina, they had not expected to feel completely spent afterward.
 

 
And Tong Zhao was even able to manage her expressions!?
 

 
What incredible professionalism!
 

 
“Wow, is she even human?”
 

 
“Hey, Lao Song, stop drinking water and look at the screen…”
 

 
In the rest area, all the guests instinctively started talking about the same person, their eyes glued to the screen showing the final challenger. When she completed her challenge, the time record flashed on the screen in exaggerated effects, accompanied by sound effects, and they all fell silent.
 

 
When the host asked the other guests for their thoughts, surprisingly, there were very few malicious comments.
 

 
They were stunned.
 

 
Host: “Now that you've seen Tong Zhao’s preliminary challenge, do you feel confident about being her opponent?”
 

 
The male guest answered instantly: “No.”
 

 
“Ah? Why not?”
 

 
“I feel like she could take me out without any expression.”
 

 
The host also asked the female guest who had given up midway and slowly completed the challenge. She replied in a standard manner, “Tong Zhao is much better than me. It’s a pity that she’s in the hunter role; otherwise, I would really want to be her teammate.”
 

 
This sentiment echoed the thoughts of most people.
 

 
After all, the winning team would receive extra bonuses, and they would have a greater chance of being favored by the production team for future survival variety shows.
 

 
No one mentioned the idea of manipulating the data anymore.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's current abilities, if they were to manipulate it again, she would have to be a Super Saiyan, right?
 

 
The preliminary event came to a successful conclusion, and the top three would receive a mysterious reward to aid in their survival on the show.
 

 
The first-place male guest looked at Duan Ge with a complex expression.
 

 
He was only ten seconds behind the young lady, and suddenly, the first-place spot didn’t seem so appealing.
 

 
“What did you say???"
 

 
After the modeling team leader ran over to Director Chen and said a few words, Director Chen’s expression changed dramatically.
 

 
Duan Ge was sitting close enough to hear their conversation clearly.
 

 
The map for each episode of ‘One Life Survivor’ would change, and the planned deserted island map had a bug that couldn’t be fixed quickly: “How could it not be fixable? If there’s a bug, just fix it!”
 

 
“No, that bug is a special kind; identifying it will take a lot of time.”
 

 
Duan Ge was stretching when Han Zhi’s sigh echoed in her mind: [Why does something go wrong every time we do a variety show?]
 

 
Last time during ‘Sea King Killer’, there was an unexpected incident that forced him to step in at the last minute.
 

 
It was impossible to delay the shoot, and killing the director wouldn’t solve anything.
 

 
After thinking for a while, Director Chen decided to change the map: “How many maps do we have that aren’t past their copyright?”
 

 
The popular wilderness themes were gone, leaving only an urban map and a Western fantasy castle.
 

 
Director Chen pressed his forehead and made a decisive call:
 

 
“Then let’s go with the urban map. Don’t bother fixing the bug; just identify it and report it to the uploading party, asking them to compensate for the filming costs!”
 

 
“Okay!”
 

 
Duan Ge quietly finished her stretching exercises.
 

 
In her mind, the Concubine Chen was puzzled, thinking: [Isn’t the urban map your strong suit? You should be happy!]
 

 
[No…]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m just wondering if this might be a bit too unfair for others.]
