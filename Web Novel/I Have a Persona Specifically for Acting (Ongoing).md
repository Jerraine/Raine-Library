# Chapter1
"Transmigrated again?”
 

 
This was the first thought that came to Tong Zhao’s mind when she opened her eyes.
 

 
Ever since she died in a car accident at the age of twenty-four, Tong Zhao had acquired a quick transmigration system. Her soul had completed arduous tasks in many different worlds, and she had long been used to opening her eyes after death, accepting a new identity, and facing new challenges.
 

 
As she sat up to observe her surroundings, she called out to the system.
 

 
Tong Zhao was in a simple, small room. Apart from the bed and a dining table, there wasn’t any extra furniture. Fortunately, there was a private bathroom, so she didn’t have to share it with other tenants. But as for cooking, that was out of the question; there was no gas stove.
 

 
Faced with this predicament, Tong Zhao actually laughed.
 

 
It seems this mission won’t be too difficult.
 

 
After all, the last time she woke up, her soul board was shattered, her four limbs were pierced by Immortal Locking Nails, and she was hung in a heavily guarded water dungeon. Compared to that, this modern world, even with a bit of poverty, was practically a vacation for her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, what is the mission this time?]
 

 
There was a dead silence in her mind—no synthesized mechanical voice answered her question.
 

 
This had never happened before.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mind was filled with suspicion, but an arrogant and spoiled female voice sounded from outside the door: 'Tong Zhao, I've come to see you.'
 

 
The sound of her name hit Tong Zhao like a bolt of lightning!
 

 
How long had it been since someone called her by that name? She had once been the favored Noble Consort Chen of the Six Palaces, Duan Ge who fought her way through the apocalypse, and Lu Xianzhang, who executed the scumbag that killed his wife to achieve enlightenment... Besides the system addressing her as Tong Zhao, she had almost forgotten her original name.
 

 
And this long-lost, familiar female voice brought a flood of memories associated with this body rushing back to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t transmigrated again.
 

 
She had transmigrated back.
 

 
Back to her most helpless and lost eighteen-year-old self.
 

 
It was half a year after her mother’s death, and her father couldn’t wait to bring his mistress, Xu Xinya, and her illegitimate daughter back into the house because the mistress was pregnant with the long-awaited grandson of the Tong family. Overwhelmed, Tong Zhao ran away from home, vowing that even if she starved to death on the streets, she would never have anything to do with that family again.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother had once been a famous film actress, and Xu Xinya was her assistant, as close as a sister.
 

 
When Tong Zhao’s mother was pregnant and it was inconvenient for the couple to have marital relations, Xu Xinya used the excuse of taking good care of her 'close friend' to get close to Tong Zhao's father, and the two of them began their illicit affair in the mansion. One thing led to another, and Xu Xinya ended up pregnant with a child of the Tong family, secretly kept outside.
 

 
Unaware of any of this, Tong Zhao’s mother thought her friend had been deceived by a scumbag, getting pregnant out of wedlock. Out of compassion, she provided financial and emotional support for the mistress. Xu Xinya, in turn, shamelessly took advantage of her kindness to continue her affair with Tong Zhao’s father.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao's mother fell seriously ill, Xu Xinya, thinking her time had come, secretly revealed the truth to her by the bedside. This truth severely shocked her, who should have been calmly recuperating, and the double betrayal from both her husband and her friend utterly broke her. She did not survive the coldest winter in Jiangcheng.
 

 
Since she was a child, Tong Zhao has idolized her mother and dreamed of becoming a big star. However, after her mother's death, everything changed. The girl's angry accusations only made her guilty father fly into a rage out of shame. This allowed her stepmother and stepsister to take advantage of the situation and take everything away from her—no living expenses, no place to stay, and all the resources shifted toward the stepsister who also dreamed of becoming a star...
 

 
Outside the door, the chatter continued incessantly:
 

 
'Stop pretending to be dead. I know you're in there. Didn't you say you wanted to sever ties with the Tong family? At least take the things you left at home with you! Look how nice I am, driving over to bring them to you myself.'
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, the one barking outside is her stepsister, Xu Zhu.
 

 
A name her cheap father chose, meaning ‘the lost pearl of the sea.’
 

 
Xu Zhu made this special trip to see her, with two main goals:
 

 
One, to feel reassured that Tong Zhao wasn’t doing well.
 

 
Two, to kick her while she’s down, to ruthlessly beat a drowning dog.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu had always envied Tong Zhao for living openly in the mansion. Seeing the young lady fall from grace and live a life worse than hers was a scene worth traveling across mountains and rivers to witness. Back then, the eighteen-year-old Tong Zhao obliged, showing her enemy's daughter her most broken and desperate side, crying and yelling at her to get lost.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, 'Just woke up. Give me a moment.'”
 

 
It immediately became quiet outside the door.
 

 
Xu Zhu really wanted to see what her stepsister looked like now.
 

 
If she had to wait, she was willing to wait.
 

 
Back then, she had lain on the bed like a dying dog for several days, tossing and turning as she mourned her deceased mother, filled with hatred but powerless to change anything. Fortunately, after crying herself out, her eyes weren’t swollen at the moment, just her complexion was a bit pale. Tong Zhao rummaged through her bag and took out a makeup kit. With her slender fingers moving quickly, she applied a base makeup and put on a bright lipstick.
 

 
After just five minutes, the person outside couldn’t wait any longer. 'Tong Zhao, I warn you not to leave me hanging out here. If you hate me or feel resentful, then open the door and say it to my face! Are you too scared to even face your own sister…'
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door.
 

 
The voice outside stopped abruptly, and Xu Zhu froze.
 

 
Standing before her, Tong Zhao was wrapped in a silk nightgown, her slightly curled black hair cascading over her shoulders and forehead. Her exposed skin was as delicate and fair as the first snow. The bold lipstick color accentuated the girl's features, making her look even more coldly beautiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her almond-shaped eyes and smiled without a hint of warmth.
 

 
'Speak.'
 

 
…
 

 
Xu Zhu was more than just speechless; she could barely breathe.
 

 
Just two days ago, Xu Zhu had seen Tong Zhao in the living room, having a breakdown while shouting and cursing at her father, then crying as she stormed out of the house. That scene was still fresh in her mind and had been so thrilling that she felt it wasn’t enough. She wanted a classic reenactment, to personally experience the pleasure of kicking someone when they’re down.
 

 
What happened to being down and out?
 

 
What happened to a mental breakdown?
 

 
Both of them took after their mothers.
 

 
One inherited the looks of an actress, while the other resembled the actress's assistant, and the difference in their beauty was immediately apparent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s beauty was very well-proportioned. From her brow arch down to the perfectly shaped bridge of her nose, her features created a face that could withstand scrutiny from any angle. At first glance, it was clear she was a well-educated young lady from a wealthy family. At this moment, Tong Zhao’s presence was overwhelming; her beauty carried a tangible aura that completely overshadowed Xu Zhu.
 

 
Xu Zhu managed to find her voice again. 'T-Tong Zhao, Auntie hasn’t been gone for long... and you’re already wearing makeup?'
 

 
Although she stuttered a bit, she knew the other person had been through so much misery lately that there was no need to think hard to find a weak spot—one poke would hit the sore point. But unfortunately for her, the person standing before her was no longer the pitiful child who would explode at the mention of her mother. Tong Zhao, who had served as an overseer of the Samsara Mirror in a cultivation world, no longer felt sorrow over her deceased mother—only hatred remained.
 

 
The revenge she owed would not be left unpaid.
 

 
But the jokes her enemies had laughed at before—this time, there would be none.
 

 
"My mom loved to see me looking beautiful. Keeping this beauty she passed on to me well-maintained is the best tribute to her," Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her gaze cold as water falling on Xu Zhu's merely delicate face. She curled her lips into a mocking smile, "Where are the things you brought for me? Hand them over."
 

 
Under the command-like tone of her words, Xu Zhu obediently handed over a large bag of clothes.
 

 
Once her hands were free, Xu Zhu suddenly realized—
 

 
Why was she being so obedient?
 

 
She had come to humiliate Tong Zhao; how could she behave like she used to, obeying her?
 

 
That’s right, back when she was trying to make a living in the Tong family, Xu Zhu had followed her mother’s advice to curry favor with the legitimate young lady, becoming good friends with the original Tong Zhao. Under Xu Xinya’s teachings, she believed that women’s friendships were only for leveraging resources and that it was all about selling at the best value.
 

 
Not only did she want to sell out her friend, but she also resented that Tong Zhao's life was better than hers.
 

 
Truly a champion among traitors.
 

 
"Tong Zhao!" Xu Zhu, ashamed and angry, gritted her teeth at her. "Do you still think you're the eldest daughter of the Tong family? My mom went for a checkup last week, and this time, she's pregnant with a boy. Even if you went back and apologized to Dad, it wouldn't matter. There's no place for you in the Tong family anymore."
 

 
After throwing out this harsh remark, Xu Zhu, still suffocated by Tong Zhao’s beauty, finally felt a bit more satisfied.
 

 
Tong Zhao listened quietly to her rant, and a genuine emotion touched the corners of her smiling lips.
 

 
From Xu Zhu's perspective, she could only see Tong Zhao's captivating eyes, unable to discern the emotions behind her bright red smile. It seemed to carry both mockery and pity, like looking down at a pest chasing crumbs on the ground.
 

 
"From the moment Tong Zhenming betrayed his wife, I ceased to be part of the Tong family. You and your mother have spent half your lives scraping and clawing, discarding morality, dignity, and friendship just to squeeze through that door..."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was cold and lazy, with a hint of a raspy, amused chuckle.
 

 
Even while insulting her, there was a seductive allure in her voice.
 

 
"Sorry, but I find it filthy to even spare you another glance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile faded as she calmly closed the door with her slender, pale hand. She then called the building's security downstairs, saying there was an unfamiliar person causing trouble outside her door and asked them to remove her. In China, there is a great emphasis on public security. An apartment complex may be old, but it must have a certain number of security personnel.
 

 
'Tong Zhao, get out here! What are you pretending to be so noble for? You’re living in this dump. You’re nothing without the Tong family! I’m going to tell Dad what you said, and don’t even think about getting any resources from my family...'
 

 
Sure enough, when the security arrived on the 13th floor, they saw Xu Zhu, angrily kicking the door in high heels and yelling.
 

 
Without much fuss, she was immediately treated as someone causing trouble and escorted away.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s words were half true.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was like a flower in a greenhouse. After leaving the Tong family, she couldn't compete with those who had connections above her, nor could she fight those with tough backgrounds and high emotional intelligence below her. The only advantage she had was a connection her mother had set up for her before she died — the lead director of the TV drama *The Legend of Emperor Ming* was a fan of her mother and, as a favor, gave Tong Zhao a role as a minor concubine, one of the female extras.
 

 
But her past self hadn’t made the most of that single opportunity.
 

 
Due to the nature of holographic filming, actors cannot retain their own consciousness; they can only perform by instinct, fused with the personality of the characters they are implanted with. Therefore, holographic films are also called 'instinctive films.' Most young idols have little life experience, let alone the dramatic experiences of the characters in the movies. The resulting performances often seem superficial, and audiences have grown accustomed to these lackluster performances.
 

 
After being humiliated and provoked by her stepsister, Tong Zhao fell into severe emotional problems. The concubine she played in the film didn’t exude the seductive charm of a femme fatale; instead, audiences only saw a pitiful and panicked girl.
 

 
Those who cared about her were pained, while those who resented her were delighted. Tong Zhao never got another role and watched helplessly as her stepsister gained fame and fortune.
 

 
But this time, having come back…
 

 
Tong Zhao walked to the mirror and studied her face, recalling the first world she had transmigrated into.
 

 
In an ancient time, she was a fox spirit tasked with hastening the downfall of a tyrant—a favored imperial concubine named Chen Guifei. Every official's memorial to the emperor had to begin by praising the emperor and then extolling Chen Guifei's beauty; otherwise, it would be considered a grave offense.
 

 
The more favored she was, the more absurd it became.
 

 
In that instant before the mirror, the thoughts and feelings of Chen Guifei throughout her life flowed through Tong Zhao's entire being.
 

 
Tong Zhao realized that not only could she recall the personalities she had embodied in the past, but she could also wield them at will!
# Chapter2
At the same time.
 

 
While Tong Zhao was exploring her newfound "cheat ability," Xu Zhu, who had been politely but firmly escorted out of the neighborhood by the security guards, got into a luxury car with an unhappy expression. After closing the car door behind her, she took out her phone from her designer handbag and dialed Tong Zhao's father's number.
 

 
Suppressing her anger, she complained in a sweet voice, "Dad, I took my sister's things over to return them and told her that there will always be a place for her at home. I asked her to come back as soon as she got over it. I even said I could move out if it comes to that..."
 

 
"How could we let you move out? Xinya is pregnant with your little brother, and I’m busy with work. She has no relatives to take care of her," Tong Zhenming replied dismissively.
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt reassured and continued to stir things up: "I really had no choice. Sister is still angry and won't forgive me. She said she would never be a part of the Tong family again, and she even said..."
 

 
She hesitated, as if unsure whether to continue.
 

 
"What else did your sister say?"
 

 
Tong Zhenming took the bait as expected.
 

 
He always positioned himself as the head of the family and was very annoyed when women and younger family members disobeyed him.
 

 
He didn’t mind a bit of whining or pouting, even if he might have done something wrong. After all, he had apologized! And yet, Tong Zhao dared to point at him and accuse him of being disrespectful in his old age. That girl ate his food and lived under his roof. In his view, no parent is ever truly wrong, and it was not her place to criticize him.
 

 
With his eldest daughter running away from home, Tong Zhenming felt his authority was being challenged. He decided she needed to learn a lesson — to realize that without his protection, she was nothing and could accomplish nothing. The once spoiled princess would be taught by harsh reality and would eventually come back to apologize. All he needed to do was sit tight and wait.
 

 
This was the confident educational insight of a middle-aged man.
 

 
Therefore, Tong Zhenming tacitly allowed his younger daughter to find out where Tong Zhao was living, to see if she had reflected on her actions after a week away from home.
 

 
"Sister also said that she thinks you're filthy and that even looking at you makes her feel dirty. If Auntie had known what kind of person you were, she would never have been with you. After all, plenty of wealthy young men pursued Auntie, and if she wasn't in poor health, she could have remarried anytime, even with Sister in tow..."
 

 
Xu Zhu said timidly.
 

 
She used the most cowardly and innocent tone to spin her little narrative.
 

 
Xu Zhu knew that her father’s proudest achievement was that the famous actress Tong Zhao's mother had favored him among many suitors. He was also very sensitive about the admiration his wife received both before and after their marriage. Even though she had retired from acting and rarely saw outsiders, it still bothered him deeply. Tong Zhenming had complained about this to his mistress many times, and Xu Zhu, having seen and heard all this, knew exactly how to hit his sore spots.
 

 
"Dream on!" Tong Zhenming erupted in anger, trembling with rage. "I raised that ungrateful girl for nothing. Would she be where she is without me? Thinks I'm filthy? Fine, even if she dies out there, I won’t care anymore! She wants to be a star? I had connections lined up for her... Forget it. It’s not like I, Tong Zhenming, only have one daughter. If she doesn’t want to acknowledge me as her father, there are plenty of others who’d kneel just for the chance to call me Dad!"
 

 
Xu Zhu was overjoyed. "But..."
 

 
—
 

 
The father enjoyed making harsh statements.
 

 
The daughter felt that calling him "Dad" while kneeling was worth it.
 

 
Both father and daughter felt that Tong Zhao had greatly underestimated her losses and was in for a rough time.
 

 
“Stop defending your sister. I know what I’m doing. Remember not to tell your mother about this; I don’t want her to be upset.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming impatiently reassured his daughter, ending the conversation with a commanding tone.
 

 
With her father’s promise not to interfere with Tong Zhao anymore, Xu Zhu felt much better and decided to immediately relay the details of the call to her mother. She hoped that even her pregnancy symptoms might improve and that she could enjoy a couple more bowls of rice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn’t disappoint Xu Zhu. He efficiently arranged for his younger daughter to participate in a girl group training program centered on youth and growth. With the support of his old friend, President Song's entertainment company, not only was she given a spot on the show, but it was also agreed that Xu Zhu’s name must be included among the main cast of girls in the script, ensuring her debut.
 

 
Once she gained some popularity, she would then tackle reliable but lower-difficulty roles in reputable productions, gradually building her career. This was considered one of the most stable and replicable paths to stardom after the rise of instinctive films.
 

 
If she couldn’t act, she could always appear on variety shows.
 

 
Without dramatic life experiences, being cute and charming on variety shows would still win the audience’s favor.
 

 
President Song, aware of the situation at home, advised, “Tong Zhao will definitely mind about the resources you were supposed to give her being given to your sister. Once she finds out, she’ll likely hold a grudge against you even more.”
 

 
“I want her to know that everything she gets is given by me and that I can take it all back anytime. I can give it to anyone I want. Xu Zhu has been raised too pampered by her mother; honestly, I’m not too fond of her either, but she can be used to balance Tong Zhao and make her realize she’s no longer the privileged only child.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming lit a cigarette and spoke slowly.
 

 
His eyes, clouded by indulgence, were filled with a determined confidence rooted in money and power. Those who obeyed would be rewarded, while those who defied him would lose everything—this was the rule of the Tong family.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s multiple life experiences, she understood that the world operated by many rules.
 

 
Big rules overshadow the small ones.
 

 
The pampered little tyrant from a wealthy family found that no one catered to him at school, and school rules didn’t apply in society. Just like when Tong Zhao, transformed into a favored concubine's daughter with a background of extinguishing wives, shone brightly during the selection, captivating the emperor at first sight. She leaped from the domestic struggle to the palace intrigue arena, advancing in status with her acting skills and strategy. Dealing with those scoundrel fathers, stepmothers, and half-sisters later was a piece of cake.
 

 
Tong Zhao's goal was to step out of the Tong family's circle and explore a bigger stage.
 

 
With a week left before the start of filming for *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor*, Tong Zhao focused on three things at home.
 

 
1. Nurturing Her Beauty
 

 
In ancient times and in the world of cultivation, Tong Zhao collected some natural beauty remedies that proved quite effective. As the saying goes, "Eighteen is free from ugly women." She was already beautiful, but after her mother’s death, she had been crying and suffering from insomnia daily, which had damaged her skin and complexion. A few days of proper care quickly restored her radiant appearance.
 

 
The role of the favored concubine in *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor* was that of a stunning beauty. Regardless of her acting skills, her looks needed to be convincing.
 

 
2. Taking Online Courses
 

 
In her original world, with the maturity and near-universal adoption of holographic technology, physical universities had gradually declined in popularity. People preferred the convenience of this technology. Unfortunately, holographic pods were very expensive, and Tong Zhao, who was penniless after leaving her home, could not afford one. She had to rely on a regular computer for learning, with self-discipline being her only aid.
 

 
3. Channeling the Spirit of the Favored Concubine
 

 
Strictly speaking, this referred to her former self.
 

 
After many practice sessions, Tong Zhao had become proficient at switching between personas in reality. However, since she couldn't afford a holographic pod, her practice was still theoretical.
 

 
"When will I ever leave this crappy place…”
 

 
A woman lying on a single bed was doing leg lifts, aiming to make her thigh lines more pronounced and tight. Despite her plain face, the charm and delicacy in her eyes made her seem like she was reclining on a luxurious concubine’s chair. If anything about her attire or lifestyle wasn’t the best, she would sulk and act spoiled.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao herself had always been indifferent to her living conditions.
 

 
It wasn’t a matter of life or death, and she didn’t particularly enjoy seeking favors from men.
 

 
Her nature wasn’t suited for being a pampered and scheming concubine; it was left to the “Empress Consort” from her past experiences in palace intrigues to take on that role.
 

 
A week passed in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The holographic pods used for film shooting were more advanced and required going outside the home to the studio’s specialized pods.
 

 
Tong Zhao did her makeup, wore a simple black outfit, tied her hair into a high ponytail, and added a black bunny-ear headband as an accessory. She looked both cool and cute, making her aura hard to pin down.
 

 
After taking a cab to the film studio, she first registered her personal information at the front desk. As she walked through the building, she saw many attractive faces, mostly people hoping to find audition opportunities, perhaps stumbling upon a role that blended well with their "true self."
 

 
The corridor benches were filled with competitors, and the atmosphere was inevitably tense.
 

 
There was youthful vitality and ambition, but also disappointment and confusion. As Tong Zhao passed through the corridor with her light pink oversized sunglasses, she seemed to stand out in stark contrast.
 

 
Behind the vibrant-colored sunglasses, only her high-bridged nose, slightly upturned and full lips, and the elegant, tight line of her jaw could be seen. Her steps were light and lively, and even without seeing her expression, one could sense her composed and cheerful demeanor.
 

 
Such composure must mean she will perform well in the audition.
 

 
Those who saw her couldn't help but think with envy.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had experienced many grand scenes.
 

 
The last time her expression changed dramatically was when she saw nearly ten thousand zombies surrounding the city from atop a high wall.
 

 
Arriving on the thirty-first floor in the elevator, Tong Zhao was immediately taken by the stage manager to meet the director.
 

 
When the director saw Tong Zhao, both the assistant director and the actors with him had slightly grim expressions.
 

 
There was a reason for this. The last time Tong Zhao came for an audition, she had appeared disheveled and lost. Her “true self” at the audition was also dull and confused—beautiful, indeed, but lacking the aura of a great beauty. It was hard to believe she was truly an affluent young lady. Such a person should have been cut from the audition, but since the director insisted on using this connection, no one else could speak up.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was just a character to drive the plot, so a decent face was enough.
 

 
Young actors who only had looks were something the audience had grown accustomed to.
 

 
“Jian Shu.”
 

 
Before calling out to him, Tong Zhao removed her sunglasses and hung them around her neck, revealing a pair of bright eyes.
 

 
The director acknowledged her and signaled her to follow him to the side.
 

 
After assessing her face and noting her good complexion, he encouraged her, “It seems like you took my advice to heart. Having your own career is most important. Perform well later; don’t put too much pressure on yourself. The empress consort is just a decorative role—it’s quite easy to play well.”
 

 
The director had given similar pep talks to many others.
 

 
Nervousness was inevitable.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled upon hearing this.
 

 
Director Xu Zijiang had wanted to help her in his previous life, but she failed to seize the opportunity and ended up becoming a pitiful figure, much to her enemies' satisfaction. This time, she would not follow the same path. She nodded obediently, “Got it, Jian Shu. I will do my best.”
 

 
“Go ahead.”
 

 
Seeing her obedient, the director felt reassured but also guessed that her performance might not be outstanding.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was a character that had nothing to do with being obedient. In the script, she was a scheming, cunning beauty. However, since the actress was spirited and had a good face, her performance would surely be better than last time, making her suitable for the role of a supporting character.
 

 
“Ah,” the screenwriter sighed, “I’m just afraid that your ‘true self’ won’t attract Emperor Ming.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shrugged nonchalantly, “By the way, does the empress consort meet her end by being given death by Emperor Ming? Maybe you should worry about whether he’ll love me so much that he won’t want to kill me.”
 

 
“...Huh?”
 

 
Under the skeptical and somewhat contemptuous gazes of others, Tong Zhao, along with the other actors, lay down in the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
Just before the equipment was activated, Tong Zhao activated her golden finger.
 

 
In the blink of an eye,
 

 
She transformed back into the palace legend who, in just three short years, rose from a courtesan to the position of empress consort!
# Chapter3
The director and staff monitored the shooting situation from the control room.
 

 
Holographic filming, similar to the quick-transmission themes in web novels, requires main actors to stay at the film studio throughout the shoot to maintain continuity. Unlike traditional films, which can be shot out of sequence, holographic filming must follow the chronological order of the script, with very few retakes. This is to minimize the changes in the performance of the "original self" based on real-life experiences, as closed shooting is designed to reduce these fluctuations.
 

 
Before closed shooting became popular, there was an actor who performed the role of a playboy well in the first half of the month. By mid-month, after being cheated on by his girlfriend, he was deeply affected and turned to Buddhism, refusing to flirt with women during the shoot. This forced a recast and reshoot. The original actor became a monk and occasionally took on roles requiring handsome monks.
 

 
He was known as the "Buddhist Idol," a rare example of a successful career transformation in the entertainment industry.
 

 
"Director, can she handle this? Last time, even Wen Zhuo couldn't bring her into character," the assistant director said with a worried expression.
 

 
Wen Zhuo, who played the male lead as Emperor Ming, was somewhat known for his acting skills. He was strong and well-suited for roles such as emperor and domineering CEO. Having debuted as a lead in idol dramas, he valued the opportunity to star in serious dramas. Although he had some reservations about the relationship with Tong Zhao, he still cooperated with the audition.
 

 
After the audition, his mood had somewhat deteriorated.
 

 
On the original timeline, due to Tong Zhao's poor performance during her first audition, the "original self" had a negative opinion of her, leading to a superficial portrayal of the Emperor's favor towards the concubine. It came across as a plastic relationship, resulting in a subpar effect.
 

 
After Wen Zhuo left the studio and watched the footage, he was deeply disheartened.
 

 
...
 

 
In the scene, the frail Empress was trying to promote her cousin to Emperor Ming during dinner.
 

 
In the story, this cousin was not close to the Empress.
 

 
She was selected from the Chen family by a family decision and promised to outshine the harem with her beauty.
 

 
"Legend of Emperor Ming" has a light-hearted tone, focusing on events not covered in official history, with interactions between the Emperor and two ministers, and the daily life in the harem as a subplot. The concubine, who is introduced later, represents a dark chapter during Emperor Ming's reign—a notorious beauty disaster that became a topic of interest for future generations.
 

 
The Emperor and Empress had a distant and discordant relationship. Emperor Ming disliked the Empress’s power-grabbing ways and showed a frosty demeanor when she tried to promote the new Chen family girl. Only after the girl showcased her gentle charm did the Emperor’s demeanor slowly soften.
 

 
This was the script.
 

 
But on the monitoring screen, after hearing this, Emperor Ming, played by Wen Zhuo, darkened his expression and immediately stood up to leave!
 

 
“What’s going on?” the assistant director asked in surprise.
 

 
“It seems that Wen Zhuo dislikes Tong Zhao too much, which is affecting his 'original self' behavior,” another person whispered.
 

 
So, instinctive films are not easily salvaged by repeated takes.
 

 
An actor's emotions can affect the behavior of their "original self."
 

 
“Should we pause? If the Emperor Ming refuses to even meet the concubine, the entire shoot will be impossible,” the assistant director inquired.
 

 
“Let’s wait a bit…”
 

 
Just as the director was sinking into deep concern, a delicate hand pulled aside the curtain, and Tong Zhao stepped forward to perform a grand bow. She had her hair in an elegant bun, and as she bowed her head, it was lower than usual, deliberately exposing a section of her snowy-white neck. Under the dim candlelight, it created a delicate, silky visual effect.
 

 
Men are visual creatures.
 

 
While the chest, waist, and legs are often associated with sexiness, Tong Zhao believed that the real erogenous zone is the mind. Sexiness is based on imagination; it can be a glimpse of the back of the neck, an exposed ankle, or a delicate silver bell on a slender wrist.
 

 
By exposing vulnerable areas and attracting the gaze of the predator, it evokes affection.
 

 
This is the experience summed up by the long-reigning favorite concubine in the harem.
 

 
Returning to conquer the Emperor with the experience of a top-ranked favored concubine is like using a dragon-slaying sword to deal with the deer in a beginner’s village.
 

 
As everyone inside and outside the scene was nervously waiting, Emperor Ming stopped in his tracks and looked at the young woman kneeling before him.
 

 
“Raise your head,” he commanded.
 

 
The staff outside the scene breathed a sigh of relief, and the director zoomed in to give Tong Zhao a close-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, showing no sign of timidity before the emperor.
 

 
Her snow-white skin and pink dress made her face look like a peach blossom.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes were full of laughter, with a clean and sweet aura. Her bright, full lips were slightly curved, irresistibly alluring.
 

 
Every inch of her was beautiful, with no flaws to be found.
 

 
One couldn't help but wonder, hidden beneath the fabric, was every part was equally flawless?
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
The staff faced with this stunning beauty felt their hearts skip a beat. The young man in charge of monitoring equipment murmured, “Tong Zhao’s original self is more charming than the real person.” The assistant director nodded in surprise, “She was so lost in the first audition in front of the Emperor Ming, and now she performs so well in the second try. No wonder she’s the daughter of the legendary Tong actress.”
 

 
“Of course, I’ve always said Zhao Zhao has talent.” The director loved hearing praise for his star and became even more convinced that he hadn’t made a mistake in choosing her.
 

 
Let’s return to the scene.
 

 
Emperor Ming was so impressed that he helped Tong Zhao to her feet and allowed her to dine with him.
 

 
During the meal, Tong Zhao showed no signs of nervousness. She cast flirtatious glances at Emperor Ming, behaving like a perfect fox spirit. Emperor Ming, in turn, wore a gentle and amused expression, clearly captivated by this bold and beautiful young woman. “Just now, I was very fortunate…” He paused, feeling that this statement might be inappropriate.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not rush him and continued to gaze at him.
 

 
“I almost missed out on such a wonderful young lady.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the monitoring room, the staff had complex expressions.
 

 
The lead actor, Song Wanzhuo, was known for his upright character and had no rumors of scandal. Previously, as a leading man in idol dramas, he had always been portrayed as a seasoned professional, endearing himself to female fans. But now…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor completely entranced by beauty?
 

 
Although he performed his role excellently and the character of Emperor Ming was supposed to be like this, it seemed he had taken it too far!
 

 
“This,” the assistant director revealed the truth, “Wanzhuo has been drawn into the scene by Tong Zhao.”
 

 
……
 

 
The next part of the story shows that even though Emperor Ming knew everything was arranged by the Empress and the Chen family, he couldn’t resist favoring the Chen girl and officially designated her as Chen Mei. Since the scene needed to pass approval, no bed scenes were filmed. Instead, actors would have a brief memory of intimacy inserted by the equipment before switching scenes.
 

 
To enhance the likelihood of the Emperor Ming actor being captivated by the beauty, the scriptwriters cleverly set this vague memory to be extremely pleasurable.
 

 
After being designated as a beauty, Tong Zhao only had four scenes left.


 
These four scenes could be summarized in eight words:
 

 
Troublemaking and insatiable.
 

 
The assistant director smiled and said, “Brother Jian, you can finally rest easy.”
 

 
“There's no such thing as resting easy when shooting a primal film. I’m quite worried that Tong Zhao won’t perform well. Although the problematic content has long been written into the character’s mind, based on what I know of Tong Zhao, she’s a sweet and easy-going girl, not at all troublesome, very considerate, and caring about others' feelings…”
 

 
Just as the director finished speaking, the monitoring screen showed Tong Zhao, who had been excused from the next day’s audience with the Empress, comfortably refusing to see the Empress and instead lounging on the dragon bed. A nervous palace maid who had been assigned with her was anxiously discussing the implications, but Tong Zhao was nonchalantly relaxed, saying, “The Empress wants to use me to bear a child, but I won’t fulfill her wish. Once you enter the palace, you belong to the Emperor; let the Chen family face their own flood.”
 

 
The senior palace maid was even more worried after hearing this. However, after the secret guard reported back to the Emperor, Emperor Ming was very pleased.
 

 
Director: “What was the original range of the lines here?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “It was a complaint about how the Chen family treated her poorly and used her; it was meant to be quite tragic. I intended for the audience to sympathize with her, as even despicable people have their pitiable aspects.”
 

 
But Tong Zhao’s performance was not tragic at all.
 

 
She was extremely happy, living much better than she had in the Chen family.
 

 
When actors enter a holographic shoot, they are infused with character settings, memories, and certain behavioral directives. Since the role of the consort is a minor female character with limited detail, the setting is relatively thin, giving the actor a lot of leeway—she is a beauty who brings disaster but without a specific style, so she can be either a delicate green tea or a seductive red tea, as long as it aligns the main storyline in a general sense.
 

 
People noticed that Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the favored consort was, well, how to put it?
 

 
Too cute and naive.
 

 
Her interactions with Emperor Ming, full of coquettishness and cuteness, turned a historical drama into an idol drama with a pink bubble. Even the middle-aged assistant director was starting to believe in love again. It seemed she wasn’t constrained by her background setting at all, showing no fear of the Emperor. Every word and action hit the Emperor’s cute spots perfectly.
 

 
When interacting with the Emperor, Tong Zhao’s portrayal of Consort Chen includes a small gesture.
 

 
She likes to take the Emperor's large hand in hers, nestling her small face into it with a sense of devotion, like a little dog entirely devoted to him. Her bright eyes also look up at him with a moist gaze, making the usually domineering Emperor Ming soften completely.
 

 
This small gesture is memorable and leaves an impression on the audience.
 

 
“It’s troubling; Tong Zhao’s portrayal doesn’t seem bad at all,” said the lighting technician.
 

 
She is very favored, but she lacks the edge of a wicked woman.
 

 
“However, their interactions are quite cute. After the show airs, there might be a new ship.”
 

 
“Ha ha, forget it. How many female viewers don't have their own opinions on our show…”
 

 
The filming went smoothly, and the backstage atmosphere was good. At this moment, one person’s expression changed: “Zhang Meng, who plays the Empress, is planning to deal a deadly blow to Consort Chen. A colorless and tasteless poison has been mixed into today's meal and has already been served to Tong Zhao!”
 

 
How could this happen?
 

 
In the storyline, the Empress’s dissatisfaction with her cousin develops gradually.
 

 
Zhang Meng is also a rather steady actor.
 

 
Screenwriter: “It might be because Tong Zhao’s performance was too arrogant. She didn't even go to pay her respects and acted as if, having slept with the Emperor, she had no intention of doing anything for her family, which might have provoked the already anxious and ill Empress.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “And now she wants to take drastic measures?”
 

 
The screenwriter insisted, “Characters need to be exaggerated to have tension. If they’re ordinary and we don’t exaggerate the setting, the plot becomes bland!”
 

 
…
 

 
At this point, it was indeed quite exaggerated—Consort Chen hadn’t even become a favored consort yet and was about to be done away with.
 

 
The director made a quick decision: “Give the palace maid next to Tong Zhao a direct command to overturn that bowl of soup.”
 

 
A direct command involves controlling a character to perform a specific action. Afterward, the character will be puzzled by their own behavior, making it a tool for urgent situations and not suitable for repeated use as it can be obvious to the audience.
 

 
“There’s no time left!”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao had already picked up the delicate porcelain soup bowl.
 

 
She sniffed the soup with her dainty nose.
 

 
Although she could only smell the rich aroma of chicken soup, her brows furrowed, and her soft lips curled into a mocking smile:
 

 
“Is this it?”
# Chapter4
The "quick transmigration" had given Tong Zhao many abilities beyond the ordinary.
 

 
The cultivation techniques from the immortal world were useless in a plane without spiritual energy, but they were still effective for strengthening the body and enhancing appearance. In the martial arts world, Tong Zhao had come from an assassin family and had been immersed in countless toxins from a young age. She had an inexplicable sensitivity to poisons that could be fatal to the human body. Regardless of how diluted the poison was or how it was mixed into rich food, she could detect it just by smell.
 

 
Her personality had changed, but the knowledge she had acquired remained the same.
 

 
“I don’t want to drink this anymore; take it away,”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao lay down on the couch, her flawless face showing a hint of arrogance. She instructed, “Don’t drink it secretly. If I don’t want something, no one else should touch it, even if it means throwing it away.”
 

 
Accustomed to her capricious behavior, the palace maid dared not disobey and could only regretfully pour the entire bowl of fine chicken soup away.
 

 
…
 

 
The screenwriter was surprised: “Is Tong Zhao just lucky?”
 

 
The director gave him a stern look.
 

 
However, the next development genuinely astonished the staff.
 

 
When the empress failed to gain favor, the younger cousin only became more cherished, gaining unprecedented popularity in the palace. Emperor Ming showed no signs of diminishing his interest in her. Initially intending to watch from the sidelines and let other high-ranking concubines deal with her, they each took turns trying to teach her a lesson. This was part of the script: to have her suffer and then transform from a scheming vixen into a black-hearted fox. However…
 

 
The character played by Tong Zhao, the Chen beauty, had never suffered once.
 

 
When it came to mentioning the Chen beauty's overbearing behavior, the lower-ranked concubines pointed out that she didn’t have the demeanor expected of her rank.
 

 
The emperor, still infatuated with Chen's beauty, decided to ask Tong Zhao for an explanation. Tong Zhao, pouting with a look that made the emperor not tired of her, said angrily, “No one at home treated me well. After entering the palace, only the emperor dotes on me. I’m not trying to show off. I just feel… I’m the one the emperor cherishes. The most distinguished man in the world treats me well; what could I possibly do wrong?”
 

 
She then muttered to herself, “I haven’t done anything wrong.”
 

 
When a man is enamored, everything a woman does seems right.
 

 
Tong Zhao aimed to establish a lasting impression during this period, gradually changing her character, providing continuous novelty, and achieving a sense of accomplishment. She started as a pampered child and then became a charming, confident favorite after her promotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao nestled in Emperor Ming’s embrace, letting him hold her slender waist.
 

 
"Your Majesty, they say my behavior doesn’t match my rank, but I don’t want to change. They think I’m unworthy, but I don’t care. Do you think I am worthy, Your Majesty?"
 

 
She lifted her face to look at Emperor Ming, and the director quickly zoomed in for a close-up.
 

 
The so-called "ironclad" straight man, Song Wanzhuo, saw the beauty's eyes turning red and felt sympathy. He wiped her tears and said something that left the staff stunned: "Why are you crying? I haven’t blamed you. Of course, you’re worthy. There’s no need to change."
 

 
?
 

 
Wanzhuo, you’re this good at handling emotions?
 

 
In the previous idol drama, you hurt the heroine’s feelings with your blunt handling of conflicts, but now you’re spouting sweet words in this palace drama?
 

 
This is actually not Song Wanzhuo’s fault.
 

 
In the previous idol drama, the heroine’s "true self" was a bright and lively little sun. Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" followed the script and fell for her. However, just like a forced situation is never sweet, apart from the plot, he wouldn’t have many sweet details for the heroine.
 

 
Who is the Consort Chen?
 

 
No matter how many emperors there are, she could win their favor just the same.
 

 
In the next day's plot, without Tong Zhao’s scenes, everyone thought her role was over. It was already quite an improvement that Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" could say sweet words to comfort others.
 

 
However, after the morning court session, Emperor Ming ordered that Consort Chen be promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen.
 

 
From Consort to Imperial Concubine—this was not just a promotion but a significant leap.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was known for his decisive action.
 

 
Does the favored consort not want to change her ways?
 

 
Fine, then it must be an issue with her rank. Change the rank, and it’s resolved.
 

 
As for why she became an Imperial Concubine?
 

 
Because the person behind the scenes making sour comments is a respected lady, which is just enough to push her down a rank.
 

 
After a round of analysis by the behind-the-scenes staff, everyone was deeply impressed.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Well, in the script, she was supposed to be promoted to Imperial Concubine in seven episodes."
 

 
Director: "That’s how instinctive movies work!"
 

 
Who could watch this and not say Tong Zhao’s true self is impressive?
 

 
The screenwriter, feeling helpless, just hoped that the following developments wouldn’t be too unexpected. Former writers often said sentimentally that characters in their writing developed their own ideas and that the writer merely put them on paper and couldn’t control them. Little did they know that years later, instinctive movies would make such worries a reality.
 

 
After being promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen, Tong Zhao became even more audacious.
 

 
When she was in a good mood, she would skip the morning greetings and lazily lie on the couch, enjoying a lie-in.
 

 
When she was in a bad mood, she would dress elaborately to go for the morning greetings. The imperial harem had strict dress codes with prohibited colors, but as everything she wore was a gift from the Emperor, accusing her of breaking the rules was tantamount to blaming the Emperor. Thus, the other concubines could only swallow their grievances, resenting her for her petty displays, only knowing how to pile on gold and jewels without any refined elegance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t care about them.
 

 
She wore the largest and finest jade and dared to wear a massive string of rubies. Such fine items would make anyone of lesser beauty look pale in comparison, but under the director’s close-up shots, the dazzlingly dressed Tong Zhao overshadowed the entire harem, truly making the six palaces' makeup appear colorless.
 

 
Although her behavior was inappropriate, she carried a kind of languid indifference in her gestures, as if no one in the world was worth her attention. She was like the faint scent of incense after it had burned out—fleeting, elusive, and ungraspable in its charm.
 

 
As the main plot of *Emperor Ming* developed to the tribute from a vassal state, Emperor Ming rewarded two important ministers. In the Qiang Kingdom, there was a tradition of comparing virtuous talents to pearls, and the largest East Sea pearl became a crucial plot item contested by the male second and third leads.
 

 
However...
 

 
Scene: The Imperial Study
 

 
Characters: Emperor Ming and Chief Steward Hai, who was about to report the list of tributes.
 

 
This was the original script.
 

 
But under the surveillance of the behind-the-scenes staff, Tong Zhao, dressed very plainly, barged in.
 

 
?
 

 
What are you doing here? Quite the scene-stealer.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t like the idea of adding extra charm, but he had specifically allowed Concubine Chen to come in.
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, understanding the situation, lowered his head. He guessed Concubine Chen had come to seek favor and make her presence known, which didn’t concern him.
 

 
The Emperor asked her what she wanted.
 

 
Tong Zhao, not bothering with formalities, didn’t grind ink but rather casually sat on the Emperor’s lap. Clearly acting out of bounds, she tilted her head and rested it on his broad shoulder, making one doubt whether she could walk independently at all. She spoke in a delicate and pretentious manner: “I haven’t been to the morning greetings these past few days.”
 

 
“I heard about it.”
 

 
“Who told you, Your Majesty?”
 

 
The Emperor replied coolly, “I figured it out myself.”
 

 
“It’s actually not my fault,” Tong Zhao, undeterred by his seemingly indifferent attitude, said sullenly. “I ran out of clothes to wear and don’t have new accessories to visit the other ladies.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, who had been pretending to be invisible, was shocked.
 

 
How shameless can Concubine Chen be!
 

 
Since her favor began, a steady stream of rewards flowed into her Yanxi Palace.
 

 
Moreover, saying she wouldn’t go for morning greetings without new accessories—could such a thing be said by a consort? Isn’t she embarrassed?
 

 
Emperor Ming: “This is unreasonable.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Yes, yes, Your Majesty is wise!”
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, her red lips slightly curled, and her eyes moist: “I want to wear new clothes every time I appear before Your Majesty, to give you a pleasant surprise.”
 

 
Emperors come in many types.
 

 
Some prefer spirited young women who aren’t afraid of authority and speak their minds, while Emperor Ming’s preference was very clear: he was a top-notch male chauvinist, not particularly concerned with women's issues as long as they pleased him and acted coquettishly. He was very receptive to that.
 

 
Many women may disdain this, but it’s effective.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t comment on this flimsy excuse but simply looked at Chief Steward Hai and said, “Since she’s here, let’s see what tributes have come this year and choose some favorites.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Just like that? Your Majesty, please reconsider!”
 

 
As a result, the East Sea Pearl, which was a key plot item fought over by the two ministers, was picked by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Of course, she also took many excellent clothes, furs, and accessories, but this pearl was the best. It was listed first on the tribute list by the vassal state’s envoy, indicating it was truly a valuable item.
 

 
Screenwriter: "What?!"
 

 
Screenwriter: "I worked two all-nighters on this script, and now it’s just gone??? Song Wanzhuo, wake up!!"
 

 
Life truly is full of ups and downs.
 

 
He was so angry that he didn’t even call Song Wanzhuo by name anymore.
 

 
In instinctive films, there’s no going back. Although the plot changed, the director didn’t call for a reshoot. Considering the cost of each shoot, the screenwriter could only humbly pat his rapidly thinning hair and mutter, “When Song Wanzhuo comes out, I’m definitely going to grab him by the shoulders and shake him, make him wake up and stop favoring this little enchantress, Chen!”
 

 
The Assistant Director pointed out: “Just yesterday, you wanted Song Wanzhuo to be nicer to Tong Zhao in the film to make the favored consort role more convincing.”
 

 
The screenwriter was even more frustrated.
 

 
He truly didn’t expect Tong Zhao to become so captivating once she got into character.
 

 
……
 

 
After shooting five consecutive episodes, it was already late at night when the actors emerged from the chamber.
 

 
Exhausted, the actors followed medical advice to exercise in the specially provided gym to counteract the negative effects of long hours lying in the chamber. After sweating it out, they showered and went to bed. This was the routine for most actors, as shooting instinctive films was incredibly demanding.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was an exception.
 

 
After finishing his stretching exercises and his usual rigorous workout, he returned to his dorm room and requested a sample of the footage from the director.
 

 
When he left the chamber, the screenwriter had been casting a very subtle gaze at him.
 

 
That gaze was tinged with five parts disappointment, three parts reproach, and two parts sympathy, which made him uneasy, suggesting that there might have been a flaw in the TV show’s performance. The lead actor he was working with was usually reliable; the only potential issue was likely with Tong Zhao, the relationship client.
 

 
Sitting on his bed, Song Wanzhuo answered a concerned call from his manager: "Hmm, I’m still up. I’m watching the sample footage before going to bed."
 

 
The manager advised, "Be careful not to be too tired tomorrow. It’ll be the same whether you watch it or not; you’ll remember it by tomorrow anyway."
 

 
Appearing in instinctive films is like having a long dream. To avoid an overload of memories flooding into his brain upon waking, the long-term memories would gradually be sorted out.
 

 
The amount of memory from five episodes would be restored after a full night’s sleep.
 

 
"It’s fine, one episode is half an hour, so five episodes will be two and a half hours. I’ll watch it at double speed and finish by midnight, then go to bed. I’m worried about Tong Zhao’s performance and afraid I might not hide my opinions about her in the show. The screenwriter's gaze towards me was strange; I’m afraid I’ve lost my touch…"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo calculated it well.
 

 
However, after watching, as he gradually recalled the memories from the show, he was completely unable to sleep.
 

 
No wonder the screenwriter’s gaze was odd…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor? I don’t know him!
 

 
Author's Note:

# Chapter5
The male lead couldn’t sleep, but Tong Zhao slept very well.
 

 
The persona of Consort Chen was not yet satisfied and wanted to continue flirting with men. She had to suppress it forcefully—she feared that if she accidentally let Consort Chen out to play for a few days, she might come back to find a long list of backup admirers on her phone, and even jumping into the Yellow River wouldn’t cleanse her reputation.
 

 
Consort Chen giggled: “What’s to be afraid of? A woman’s success is inseparable from men.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied: “That was your era. The modern world is different.”
 

 
Consort Chen huffed and ignored her.
 

 
In quick transmigration, conquering a world is almost like a lifetime. Personality splitting is a forced and helpless measure to protect oneself.
 

 
These personas are like one-sided and extreme versions of Tong Zhao.
 

 
One who can’t live without men and likes muscular men.
 

 
And another who is annoyed by males in general and can only slightly tolerate young and inexperienced ones.
 

 
Early in the morning, Tong Zhao enjoyed the special gym facilities, did basic muscle exercises, and then returned to her room to meditate and absorb the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy of this era is thin compared to the cultivation era, persistent practice will surely bring great benefits over time. Since it is an intangible wealth accumulated through her own blood and tears, she would make full use of it.
 

 
In the staff canteen, the director immediately spotted Tong Zhao.
 

 
He took his meal and naturally sat down in front of her. After exchanging a few pleasantries and noting that she looked well, he said, “The part you acted in will start airing tomorrow. My suggestion is not to look at the reviews. Both good and bad feedback can easily affect your subsequent performance… Also, try to avoid things that might destabilize your emotions. For instance, during his performance, Song Wanxue would cut off external communication and only let his manager relay important matters.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, looking particularly obedient.
 

 
In truth, she didn’t take it to heart.
 

 
Tong Zhao had long since grown indifferent to others' evaluations.
 

 
As for Consort Chen? She was most accustomed to being criticized and insulted. Whether it was the military officials cursing her during court sessions or the unsuccessful scholars writing sarcastic poetry, it didn’t affect her beauty. The scholars had long deciphered the secret code to gain favor with the emperor—flattering the consort with praise.
 

 
“Got it, thank you, Uncle Jian.”
 

 
“No need to be so polite…”
 

 
Before he could finish, Tong Zhao’s phone rang, with the caller ID flashing brightly: [Tong Zhenming].
 

 
Under the director’s disapproving gaze, Tong Zhao answered the call.
 

 
“Hello, Mr. Tong?”
 

 
The distant address successfully irritated Tong Zhenming, causing him to miss the cheerfulness in his daughter's tone.
 

 
“After all these years of raising you, you don’t even know how to address your father,” he sneered, unable to wait to remind her, “The first episode of *Star Selection Girls* reached platinum level in viewership.”
 

 
Viewership ratings are categorized into unique levels: black iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, emerald, and peak. Achieving the platinum level in the first episode indicates that the investment in pre-promotion has received reasonable market feedback. If the quality is maintained and effective marketing is applied, it might even surpass the diamond level.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Are you making a comeback in midlife?”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhenming was momentarily stumped by his daughter’s thought process: “Zhu Zhu was on that show; in the first episode, she had the most screen time, and the member discussion was also in the top three.”
 

 
He didn’t really understand the entertainment industry but wanted his daughter to know that his investment had paid off.
 

 
Tong Zhenming turned his attention to provoking his eldest daughter.
 

 
He knew that Tong Zhao was shooting an instinctive film and that it was best not to have severe emotional fluctuations during production. He also knew this could significantly unsettle her performance. But so what? Disobedient juniors should lose everything. He wanted his daughter to understand his authority and set some rules.
 

 
“Let me know when you’re in drag. I won’t watch any show you’re in.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was flat but laced with sarcasm.
 

 
The director’s look of disapproval turned to surprise as he watched.
 

 
After ending the call, Tong Zhao immediately blocked her father’s number and explained to the director, “I’ll let him out when I’m in a better mood.”
 

 
Director: “I thought you’d yell at him.”
 

 
“Why should I scold him? Forget it. We're family by blood, and scolding feels too constrained. I know him well; bringing up my mother won't make him feel guilty. It’ll be more distressing for him if he’s caught off guard and has nowhere to vent his anger.”
 

 
As she spoke, Tong Zhao realized that what the director mentioned as “things that might destabilize your emotions” probably referred to *Star Selection Girls*. Uncle Zhi Jian was always meticulous, contrary to his rough exterior, and he cared for her, his junior, especially well. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel touched and allowed the director to comfort her for a while, appearing genuinely appreciative.
 

 
After finishing her meal, Tong Zhao left first.
 

 
The director, slowly savoring his tea, hadn’t enjoyed his quiet tea for long when Song Wanqing joined him.
 

 
“Director, are you very familiar with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Song Wanqing, handsome with a strong jaw and bright eyes, had a very upright and attractive appearance.
 

 
He usually spoke in a particularly sunny and cheerful manner, making him a young star appealing to all ages.
 

 
The director, seeing him unusually hesitant and unsure, felt a bit curious: “An old friend’s daughter wanted to act, so I gave her a chance. It was uncomfortable during the audition, but the actual performance adjusted well, right?”
 

 
“Far more than that.”
 

 
Last night, watching the sample footage, Song Wanqing was so embarrassed he rolled around on the bed, tossing and turning.
 

 
He thought that was the worst of it.
 

 
Little did he know that the real torment was still to come.
 

 
After struggling through just five hours of sleep, he woke up to find himself haunted by memories from the drama, frozen in the pressures of the past dynasty. Each day, he was convinced to execute the rebel’s daughter, which occupied a third of the storyline. Despite the opposition, he not only promoted Chen to a noble consort but also followed her wishes, giving her the title of "Consort Chen," conferring unlimited honor upon her...
 

 
Damn, it's overwhelming!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao from a distance earlier, Song Wanqing almost couldn’t resist walking over to embrace his beloved precious.
 

 
He voiced his troubles.
 

 
“Every time I close my eyes, I see Tong Zhao’s face. She’s my consort, you know? Really. It might not seem like it from just watching the sample footage, but the Emperor is completely captivated by the consort. He even thinks about her during court sessions. So, it’s quite normal for me to think about her during my morning workout, right?”
 

 
It's common for actors in instinctive films to be influenced by their on-screen emotions, so large productions might have professional psychologists on standby. *The Legend of the Emperor* was assessed before filming, and since it didn’t include scenes with major real-world impacts (like crimes or arson), there were no psychologists prepared. Therefore, actors usually seek help from the director when they have concerns.
 

 
Since Song Wanqing was familiar with Director Xu, he confided all his feelings to him.
 

 
Song Wanqing was deeply troubled.
 

 
Yet, when he looked up, he saw Director Xu smiling happily.
 

 
Song Wanqing: “...Is it really okay to build happiness on my suffering?”
 

 
“Sorry,” Director Xu’s smile faded, but the underlying emotion remained cheerful, “Since you both have such great chemistry, the audience will definitely feel it. You’ll also be able to clear the stigma of emotionless performances in romantic dramas.”
 

 
Instinctive films in idol dramas are famously easy to shoot.
 

 
After all, with handsome men and beautiful women, it’s not hard to create some sparks once the character templates are implanted in their minds.
 

 
Moreover, in idol dramas, the characters are often flat, the plot straightforward, and everyone is either a rich second-generation heir or a star. As long as you have a good-looking face, even if the acting is a bit wooden, the audience is willing to accept it.
 

 
But despite the easy nature of the material, Song Wanqing just couldn’t perform well.
 

 
He was too picky about women on a subconscious level.
 

 
After adopting the character template, he could be in a romance within the drama, but his romantic scenes lacked emotion.
 

 
What could be portrayed as a passionate love, at first sight, ended up looking like an arranged marriage.
 

 
But opportunities in the entertainment industry are mysterious.
 

 
Song Wanqing encountered an excellent manager who established an “old guard” persona for him. With many female fans who were drawn to his type, it was easy to win them over. Later, he starred in a commercial drama without any romantic plot, and his performance was outstanding, solidifying his position.
 

 
But with this stigma, Song Wanqing shouldn’t expect to play many romantic roles.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Song Wanqing’s expression brightened a bit.
 

 
However, his pride remained intact: “How can previous mediocre actresses compare to my beloved consort?”
 

 
“You were just complaining about whether you could replace your beloved consort,” the director pointed out, but recalling Tong Zhao’s performance during the initial audition, he gave Song Wanqing an out: “Don’t dwell on that. Her screen time is limited in the future. If you’re genuinely interested, you should get her contact information soon.”
 

 
Though she’s a supporting character, the consort’s role isn’t significant.
 

 
She’ll soon be condemned to death by the Ming Emperor due to family troubles.
 

 
There are many cases of actors developing feelings from their roles in instinctive films. The director, seeing that Song Wanqing is relatively clean and upright in the industry, offered this advice.
 

 
“Let’s see. If you really end up falling for her, I’m afraid I might be reluctant to have her killed off in the show and would just disband the harem directly.”
 

 
Song Wanqing joked.
 

 
He was afraid of genuinely falling for her after a few more looks, which is why he hadn’t dared to approach her earlier.
 

 
The director laughed and changed the subject to discuss the relationship between the male lead and the second male character.
 

 
Meanwhile, after returning to her room, Tong Zhao went online to check the situation with “Star Selection Girls.”
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao lived under the shadow of her stepsister's fame and success for so long that her heart had been tempered to the point where, while she bit into a juicy, sweet apple, she could scroll through Weibo about Xu Zhu with complete composure. She mainly wanted to confirm if everything was developing just as it did before her time travel.
 

 
Xu Zhu now had her own official Weibo account.
 

 
@StarSelectionGirl-XuZhu
 

 
@XuZhuNationalFanClub
 

 
There was also a fan club in the name association, likely organized by the company to give new fans from the first episode a place to gather and gradually develop into true fans.
 

 
#StarSelectionGirlXuZhu#
 

 
#WhiteRichBeautyPrincessXuZhu#
 

 
#XuZhuDangerousXiaohan#
 

 
Tong Zhao clicked on the entries related to the "White Rich Beauty Princess" tag.
 

 
[ZhuZhu the little princess is so sweet and good, mama is a fan!]
 

 
[Wow, look at Xu Zhu's whole set of high-end luxury stuff in her dorm, I’m genuinely envious. Does Princess Xu Zhu still need a little sister?]
 

 
[Arranging Xu Zhu as an extravagant YXH, is the editor’s brain malfunctioning? The girl clearly grew up with the best things and doesn’t take them seriously, totally speechless.]
 

 
Well, just like in her previous life, Xu Zhu’s image was crafted by her agent as the pampered little princess.
 

 
The fact that she grew up with the best things was indeed true.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was little, she had so many good things that she couldn’t use them all, and her close friend Xu Zhu would often take them.
 

 
Her mother knew about this and specially bought a new set for Xu Zhu.
 

 
Both mother and daughter thought nothing of it since they were good friends.
 

 
Now, reflecting on it, Tong Zhao felt a bit nauseous and quickly sat down to recite a calming mantra, which made her feel much better. However, after reciting the mantra so often, it split off a part of her consciousness in the cultivation world. The usually silent personality of Lu Xianzhang rarely came out of hiding and said, “Those who betray me deserve to die.”
 

 
Every word seemed to emit a cold, sword-like aura.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and replied, “Alright, this is a law-abiding society.”
 

 
The Empress Chen Gui fei chuckled, “Let Xu Zhu this bitch be smug for a few days. Once Zhao Zhao’s life is better than hers, it’ll be her turn to suffer.”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, who couldn’t stand her flirtatious ways with men, went silent again.
 

 
Empress Chen Gui fei continued her assault, “I performed so well in the drama, making the Emperor fall head over heels for me, giving Zhao Zhao a big boost in the face. What use are you? If you’re useless, stay out of the way!”
 

 
When Tong Zhao first became Lu Xianzhang, she was being forced into marriage for her path to enlightenment.
 

 
The character’s deep-seated hatred of men meant that she lived a life of loneliness in that world.
 

 
After a moment of silence, Lu Xianzhang finally burst out with a powerful declaration:
 

 
“Give me a sword, and I’ll bloodily wash the Tong family clean!”
# Chapter6
Of course, Tong Zhao couldn’t really kill anyone.
 

 
She pacified Lu Xianzhang, then meditated and practiced for a while, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy in this world was extremely thin and immortality through cultivation was impossible, spending the same time on it was at least more effective than applying a hydrating face mask.
 

 
During this time, the episodes of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao began airing.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* maintained an average viewership rating at the tail end of the Diamond level, and online discussions were consistently high. For a newcomer, even a small guest role would be a coveted opportunity. The problem was that Song Wanxue’s reputation as a rigid, straight-laced man was well-known. Having him play an emperor enthralled by a favorite concubine? No problem; his majestic presence as the "Longevity Lord" was undeniable.
 

 
But having him portray an emperor who was lovesick and dazed by his favored concubine?
 

 
Fans could easily imagine him saying, “This is against the rules,” with his usual stern expression.
 

 
The romance between the Emperor and the Concubine was one of the few emotional storylines in the drama. Those who disliked Song Wanxue had been waiting for him to falter since the premiere, hoping for a glimmer of hope when the Concubine appeared.
 

 
Many were eagerly anticipating Song Wanxue's downfall.
 

 
Marketing accounts quickly joined in to stir the pot, and even Song Wanxue’s agent bought some promotional support to reinforce his image as an emotionless, straight-laced emperor—since he was bound to fail, it was better to extract some residual value from the collapse!
 

 
In the world of instinctive acting, who hasn’t had a failure?
 

 
As long as there’s a hook, there’s hype.
 

 
Indeed, with the buzz around #SongWanxueEmotionalScenes#, the latest episode featuring Tong Zhao performed well in the pre-release.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* aired at 6 PM, and the holographic viewing halls were already packed with people.
 

 
For those who couldn’t afford a holographic helmet or viewing pod, traditional viewing methods were also available. True drama fans subscribed to both options, first enjoying the director's camera work and narrative from a distance, then immersing themselves in a 360-degree experience of the drama. Regardless of the visual method, audiences could watch while sending bullet comments or even tune in to live commentary and critiques from streamers who had set up separate rooms for fans.
 

 
Of course, some of the gifts and tips received had to be shared with the drama and the platform.
 

 
While the audience and onlookers eagerly awaited Song Wanxue's performance, the attention given to Tong Zhao, the newcomer, was relatively low. After all, she lacked fame and had no agent or company backing her, operating purely independently. Her stepsister Xu Zhu would have been delighted to see her fail, so naturally, she wouldn’t help her out. Moreover, it was suspected that the high-spirited Tong Zhao wouldn’t ride on her stepsister's coattails.
 

 
Tong Zhao indeed wasn’t inclined to do so.
 

 
She considered it unlucky.
 

 
Song Wanxue's fans were also in high spirits.
 

 
In this lively atmosphere, the latest episode of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* began.
 

 
The story starts with the impatient Emperor Ming being summoned to the Empress's palace. The Emperor and the Empress, who was obtained through political marriage, had a strained relationship. Viewers humorously claimed that Song Wanxue's performance was true to character, portraying the distant and emotionally detached relationship between the Emperor and Empress so well that everyone believed there was no affection between them. The Emperor was even somewhat annoyed with her, resenting her excessive ambition and focus on securing benefits for her family.
 

 
Sure enough, when the Empress mentioned introducing her younger sister, Emperor Ming slammed his teacup down on the table with a dark face.
 

 
Audience members who had seen the plot summary knew that the Emperor was about to experience a dramatic change of heart.
 

 
[The more he despises her now, the more he will favor her later.]
 

 
[Waiting for Emperor Ming's moment of true affection.]
 

 
[While you're waiting for true affection, remember who’s playing the Emperor—it's Song Wanxue! Does he really have the awareness of "cherishing and valuing" in his mind? Only the director’s forceful intervention will likely make him succeed in this role.]
 

 
This refers to an emergency measure rarely used on main characters because it can create irreparable problems. Some characters might feel like they’re possessed, leading to endless complications. Since it’s not an action genuinely motivated by the character, the scene can appear very awkward.
 

 
As the audience debated, a delicate white hand parted the curtain, and a young woman stepped out gracefully.
 

 
At this moment, she maintained the proper etiquette for a woman presenting herself to the Emperor, with her head bowed.
 

 
Even the audience could not see her face.
 

 
But the camera clearly conveyed the message:
 

 
She was a stunning beauty.
 

 
Moreover, Tong Zhao’s figure was also exceptional, successfully piquing the audience's curiosity.
 

 
[Ahhh, I can’t see, camera, move down a bit!]
 

 
[Someone get the photographer and drag him out for execution!]
 

 
[I’m so frustrated, why can’t I afford a holographic chamber? I really want to bend down to see the beauty QAQ]
 

 
Fortunately, it didn’t take long. With Emperor Ming’s command, “Raise your head,” the audience finally got to see the appearance of the Empress's younger sister.
 

 
She was incredibly beautiful.
 

 
Even under the close-up ultra-clear camera, no flaws could be found. She looked up at Emperor Ming, and guided by the camera, the audience felt as if everyone was being boldly gazed upon and flirted with by her, just like Emperor Ming.
 

 
The audience subconsciously held their breath.
 

 
There are many beautiful people in the entertainment industry, but those who become famous are often those whose beauty can take your breath away. If the first impression doesn’t shock the audience, they’ll have to rely on their talent to slowly build a fanbase. But with just one glance, some industry insiders could tell that this girl was exceptional.
 

 
Gazing at her with her enchanting eyes, hearts softened.
 

 
[………]
 

 
[…………I need all the information on this lady within three seconds!]
 

 
[Everyone shut up, I’m going to give a number now. In three minutes, I want to follow the Empress’s sister’s Weibo!]
 

 
It’s no wonder the audience was moved. For instinctive films, portraying certain character auras cannot rely on traditional acting alone; it requires relevant life experiences and emotional depth. What they were seeing at that moment was the real-life embodiment of Empress Chen, who had once laughed her way through palace intrigues and enjoyed enduring favor.
 

 
Unable to do anything else, but top in charming others.
 

 
The audience was first struck by the new character’s beauty, then quickly immersed themselves back into the story.
 

 
Then they saw the Emperor, who spoke with an unexpectedly gentle tone.
 

 
?
 

 
For a moment, the screen was filled with question marks.
 

 
Humans are creatures of double standards.
 

 
It was normal for the audience to be impressed, but seeing the Emperor’s genuine affection, especially in the scene of Song Wanxue’s transformation, the show’s effect was maximized.
 

 
[When we’re sending question marks, it’s not that we have a problem, but that the Emperor has a problem.]
 

 
[Is this really the serious, old-fashioned Song Wanxue? He’s breaking his character…]
 

 
[Damn, but the brother’s gentle expression is so handsome!]
 

 
Fortunately, instinctive films can't be fake; they're akin to a semi-reality show. Even though the audience was amazed, they knew Song Wanxue’s previous performances weren’t fake. It just seemed that this time, he had somehow surpassed himself and performed even better in the film.
 

 
It might be that having more experience with instinctive films has made him better adapted to his "true self."
 

 
This was a common speculation.
 

 
Regardless, Song Wanxue’s improvement was a positive boost for the overall quality of "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor," and the audience felt more confident in immersing themselves in the story. However, as they continued watching, they started to notice something strange.
 

 
Was it not that Song Wanxue had suddenly become more perceptive, but rather that this newcomer was incredibly charming?
 

 
The audience saw Tong Zhao acting cute and innocent in front of the Ming Emperor, always displaying naive beauty, and managing to make the Ming Emperor look like a lovesick fool.
 

 
Such a sweet girl!
 

 
No wonder the Ming Emperor liked her; who wouldn’t want to be an emperor when faced with such beauty?
 

 
The episode ended with the audience’s admiration.
 

 
The biggest beneficiaries were undoubtedly the actors playing the Ming Emperor and his cousin.
 

 
Riding the wave of Song Wanxue’s major transformation, Tong Zhao gained considerable attention. After this episode aired, her previously ignored actor’s profile suddenly received several signing offers. However, most of these were from small agencies and minor companies trying their luck. She glanced at them, found none of them appealing, and decided to consider her options further without rushing into signing a contract.
 

 
After Tong Zhao opened her verified actor's Weibo account, the director noticed that she had no posts at all. He urged her to quickly post something so that when the official drama account promoted her, some fans might transfer their affection from the character to her.
 

 
This suggestion was also the director’s way of taking care of her.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t immediately think of what to post.
 

 
After all, she was originally quite low-key and didn’t really use social media. Her skills were all developed during her fast-travel experiences and were managed by other personas. Posting on Weibo was something she could leave to Han Zhi, who had become a top celebrity.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Zhi Ge, help me post a selfie on Weibo.]
 

 
[Sure.]
 

 
In no time, a clear and pleasant male voice echoed in her mind.
 

 
Perhaps because the system saw her mission completion rate as too high, ordinary roles were no longer challenging.
 

 
Han Zhi was the only time she had played a male character.
 

 
Han Zhi was exceptionally good at taking selfies. He had practiced it, knowing how to adjust angles and apply filters, and was more skilled than many girls. The results were outstanding. The person was still recognizable, but the appearance naturally looked even better.
 

 
After posting the selfie, Han Zhi went back to being low-profile.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
The one who turned the Emperor into a lovesick fool is me [image]
 

 
The caption adopted the concubine’s persona, but the accompanying selfie was quite different.
 

 
Han Zhi wore a black suspender dress with a matching beret. She was slender, but her lines were not particularly soft. The shot from above highlighted her graceful jawline and collarbone, and the composition was impeccable. With a casual glance angled slightly upward, it electrified the viewers who stumbled upon it.
 

 
Damn.
 

 
In the drama, her eyes were like autumn waters, but off-screen, they were dazzlingly electric?
 

 
Typically, such an outstanding performance in the first role is often due to a genuine portrayal.
 

 
Viewers were prepared to see a sweet little fairy (fairy or enchantress) but instead saw a cool, androgynous beauty. She was beautiful and still the same person, but the feeling was different.
 

 
Fans witnessed the transformation of a small actress from O to A, from 0 to 1, and their curiosity was immediately piqued.
 

 
Unlike Xu Zhu, who flaunted her privileged background and actively promoted herself to fans, Tong Zhao posted her Weibo and then ignored the online buzz. She hadn't signed with a company or had a manager, so the resulting heat and public opinion were entirely generated by the audience.
 

 
Director Xu Zijian was paying attention and increasingly convinced that the goddess's daughter was indeed a promising talent.
 

 
He needed to find her a reliable manager soon...
 

 
At this moment, some were happy, and some were worried.
 

 
Xu Zhu, in her all-weather filming dormitory, decided to ignore her sister’s affairs, fearing that competitors might notice any signs. Since she had already done all she could in terms of mindset, and her sister was very good at pretending in public, she didn’t believe she could keep up the pretense in a role in a reality film.
 

 
She was confident, so she wasn’t the one worried.
 

 
The one worried was the Emperor.
 

 
In the drama, the Emperor only favored Consort Shen, visiting her palace every day, and even wished he could hold her while reviewing official documents.
 

 
Outside the drama, he couldn't even see her, and he really missed her face.
 

 
He was obsessed.
 

 
He thought he was going to fall.
 

 
After all, he did like the type of woman that Consort Shen represented—delicate, graceful, and beautifully dependent on a man.
 

 
If he truly fell for her, he planned to pursue her once filming ended.
 

 
This thought persisted until he saw the actress playing Consort Shen lifting weights in the gym.
 

 
?
 

 
Why did the beloved have a barbell in her hand?
# Chapter7
Song Wanzhuo didn’t come at the best time.
 

 
At the moment, Tong Zhao's primary personality had lent control to Han Zhi, who said he wanted to lift some weights.
 

 
Tong Zhao also disliked the fact that her current body lacked any muscle tone and only appeared slim because she couldn't gain weight. So, she agreed to Han Zhi's small request, as long as he didn't overdo it. She didn't want to be a soft, puffy person, nor did she want to become a muscular, buff woman.
 

 
So, what Song Wanzhuo saw was a consort with an indifferent expression and eyes that, despite their starry brightness, had a cold undertone.
 

 
While exercising, Han Zhi tied her long hair into a neat ponytail.
 

 
In short, nothing about her looked like Consort Shen from *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming*.
 

 
He blurted out, "Tong Zhao, you’re training in the strength area too?"
 

 
Hearing someone call her name, Tong Zhao looked up at Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The face was still the same face.
 

 
Her eyelashes were long and thick, like dark raven feathers, but the eyes beneath were cold, almost electric.
 

 
"Yes, Brother Wanzhuo.”
 

 
In the entertainment industry, seniority is important, and Tong Zhao was also used to calling everyone "brother" or "sister" when she met them, always observing proper etiquette. As soon as she spoke, Song Wanzhuo sensed something different again. "Brother Wanzhuo" and "Your Majesty" were both forms of respect, but in the show, when the consort called out "Your Majesty," it was always with a soft, delicate southern accent, while the actress’s own voice was slightly deeper, with every pronunciation crisp and clear.
 

 
When Song Wanzhuo looked at her now, he didn’t feel the slightest flutter in his heart.
 

 
His sixth sense told him this wasn't his consort!
 

 
But it was indeed the same person.
 

 
Suppressing his strange thoughts, Song Wanzhuo moved to the equipment next to Tong Zhao and started training, chatting with her intermittently.
 

 
“The audience says we have great chemistry together.”
 

 
“Brother Wanzhuo guided me well, so my subconscious easily got into character.”
 

 
“Hehe,” Song Wanzhuo liked being praised, but he also spoke frankly: “Your 'id' is quite distinct and charismatic. Your future on the stage is bright. Trust me, after this airs, when you audition for palace drama roles, even if it’s not the lead, you’ll at least snag a supporting role.”
 

 
Compared to traditional films, there are far fewer instances of unspoken rules or backdoor deals in instinct films now.
 

 
First, instinct films, when done well, are genuinely profitable and have especially high production costs.
 

 
Second, those who need to use backdoor connections generally have weaker “id” traits.
 

 
The roles left for these connected individuals are usually wealthy young ladies or gentlemen and seductively charming green tea characters, allowing them to perform in line with their true selves.
 

 
Or they would be cast in minor roles that, even if performed mediocrely, wouldn’t affect the overall situation.
 

 
Originally, the role of the Empress's cousin was intended to be a mediocre vase character.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s surprising performance brought the character to life.
 

 
"Thanks, brother," Tong Zhao smiled slightly, but her tone remained cool and detached. "But next time, I’d like to try a different type of role. I might not audition for palace dramas for a while."
 

 
Hearing this, Song Wanzhuo’s face was full of disapproval.
 

 
After all, instinct films are different from traditional ones. There's no need to rush to broaden one's acting range. Especially for newcomers, it’s important to stabilize their “id” traits; at least that way, they can thrive within a particular genre. However, after a second thought, he gave her some solid advice: “You could try playing a femme fatale or a player type in a modern drama. That would suit you perfectly.”
 

 
Tong Zhao still smiled lightly. "Brother Wanzhuo really understands."
 

 
This wasn’t Han Zhi pretending; it was because Tong Zhao's different personas were almost arguing with each other in her mind.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I should always be the one on stage."
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I can make Zhao Zhao the most popular star among male fans! No man can resist me!"
 

 
Immortal Master Lu: "Only knowing how to seduce men has no future."
 

 
The personas accumulated from other worlds also wanted their chance to appear and leave a bold mark in instinct films. Naturally, they weren’t willing to see Tong Zhao always acting in palace dramas, which was the domain where Lady Chen, the Noble Consort, could slay the entire field.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "Anyway, Zhao Zhao's first role was played by me. I’ve contributed to Zhao Zhao's success! I’ve flirted with men for Zhao Zhao! I want to see Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"But the role you played wasn’t the female lead."
 

 
The war correspondent sharply hit the sore spot of Lady Chen, the Noble Consort.
 

 
The noble consort, after all, only played a guest role.
 

 
Tong Zhao massaged her buzzing head.
 

 
While she was dealing with the chaos in her mind, Song Wanzhuo finished his workout and left feeling refreshed.
 

 
Half of his happiness came from the endorphins of exercise, and the other half from resolving his inner conflict.
 

 
He called his agent and started rambling: "Old Zeng, I've interacted with Tong Zhao. I realized my little dilemma about falling for her because the role was so superficial. It’s nonexistent. She’s not my beloved consort—she’s my good bro!"
 

 
The agent was utterly bewildered.
 

 
"A good bro? Are you sure?"
 

 
He had watched the show, and the charm the Empress’s cousin displayed was exactly Song Wanzhuo's type.
 

 
"Really, you haven’t met her in person. The more I talk to her, the more I feel like she’s a guy," Song Wanzhuo mused, refining his description. "Not the kind of rough tomboy, but rather, she’s very refined and good-looking. But when we talk and interact, I subconsciously treat her like a bro—a cool, handsome dude."
 

 
Something like this?
 

 
The agent was puzzled. "It's good you didn't develop feelings for her because of the role. Your fans want you to focus on your career and not get a girlfriend too soon."
 

 
...
 

 
Since Tong Zhao's scenes were interspersed within the main storyline, when Song Wanzhuo re-entered the pod, she was on a video call with the agent recommended by the director. The agent was a competent woman aged between 28 and 32, surnamed Chu, whom Tong Zhao respectfully called Sister Chu.
 

 
Sister Chu was quite friendly and didn’t put on airs or lay down strict rules just because Tong Zhao was a newcomer. She was straightforward about the contract. Tong Zhao didn't have many demands; she was willing to fight for resources with her own abilities. She just wanted someone to help her arrange variety show appearances and promotions.
 

 
They discussed the contract details, and after reaching a consensus, they signed it.
 

 
One of the reasons things went so smoothly was that Tong Zhao remembered Sister Chu from her past life as quite capable, personally leading a top-tier male star to fame, without any particularly outrageous scandals. However, Sister Chu was the type who achieved success later in her career; in the original timeline, it would be a few more years before she met her benefactor.
 

 
After signing the contract, Sister Chu assured her that she would guide her well.
 

 
“I trust you,” Tong Zhao replied with a smile.
 

 
She wasn't interested in clinging to powerful connections ahead of time. Instead, she wanted to become someone others would want to cling to.
 

 
For five consecutive episodes, the parts featuring Tong Zhao were particularly popular—this girl was just too interesting.
 

 
At first, people thought she was a master manipulator, a "green tea" expert. Typically, when an ordinary person enters the palace, they would be cautious at first, endure the scolding of seniors, and only take revenge after establishing themselves. But not Chen Pin. Her way of gaining a foothold was to use the other concubines’ bullying against her to cry to the Emperor.
 

 
When ordinary concubines played the victim, it was, "They're so vicious; I’m so pitiful."
 

 
When Chen Pin played the victim, it was, "They’re so vicious; Your Majesty is so pitiful."
 

 
The audience knew her character was set up to be a bad woman, so watching her act cute and play innocent in the male lead's arms was highly entertaining and had a great comedic effect. Some viewers, with time on their hands, clipped her coquettish scenes into GIFs and memes, finding her expressions to be quite theatrical. Even without sound, she was adorably charming, perfect for "cute" reaction memes.
 

 
Discussion threads related to "The Legend of Emperor Ming" sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, drawing in a wave of female viewers who came to learn the art of "green tea."
 

 
However, after she established herself: Chen Pin stopped being "green tea."
 

 
She became "black tea," openly mocking and humiliating other concubines, becoming the little tyrant of the harem. Li Fei, who refused to believe this, relied on her higher rank to cripple a cat that Chen Pin was raising. Ostensibly, it was an accident, and she sent her head maid to deliver the dying, crippled kitten back to Chen Pin’s palace with a fake apology.
 

 
Li Fei wanted to disgust and humiliate her, and she also intended to scare her a bit.
 

 
It's just a cat; what could Chen Pin possibly do?
 

 
Unexpectedly, Chen Pin turned hostile on the spot.
 

 
She immediately ordered the young eunuch, who was skilled in martial arts and bestowed upon her by Emperor Ming, to pin down the two palace maids who admitted to crippling the cat and were arrogant and overbearing. She demanded that they receive the same punishment as the cat—broken legs. Since senior maids represent the dignity of their masters, Li Fei was furious and stormed into Chen Pin's palace to make trouble, only to find Emperor Ming already there.
 

 
Before Li Fei could cry and play the victim, the Dog Emperor provided a solution: "They're just two palace maids. Drag them out and beat them to death to settle it."
 

 
The maids' hearts sank.
 

 
"Beating them to death is such a waste," Chen Pin said, leaning on Emperor Ming's arm in front of Li Fei. She leaned so close that half of her soft body was almost resting on him, making Li Fei inwardly curse her as a vixen. "The two maids said Snowball is just an animal, thinking I wouldn't hold it against them. So, let's let them live and die like animals. When Snowball’s injuries heal, then they can recover too."
 

 
Humans can endure much more than a small cat.
 

 
In other words, even if these two maids had strong enough lives not to die, as long as the cat wasn’t fully healed, they’d be beaten to the same extent as her Snowball.
 

 
Too cruel.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
At the same time, this approach matched the newcomer's "true self" perfectly—strong and fierce. She portrayed the scorpion-like beauty with vivid realism. If her "true self" were more mediocre, one could hardly imagine such a method of retaliation.
 

 
Emperor Ming agreed, ordering others to pick two new palace maids for Li Fei, while leaving the current two for Chen Pin to "play" with.
 

 
Chen Pin still felt it wasn't enough. That night, she whispered in the Emperor’s ear on the pillow, successfully making him view Li Fei in a much worse light. The next day, her status was demoted from Li Fei to Li Pin—oh no, Yu Pin.
 

 
As for whether it was the "Yu" meaning "surplus" or the "Yu" meaning "a fish that’s destined to be eaten by a cat," who could say?
 

 
Yu Pin thanked the Emperor for the decree and then vomited blood in anger.
 

 
...
 

 
[Too ruthless, too ruthless—is this the boldness of a favored concubine?]
 

 
[Was that necessary? It’s just a cat.]
 

 
[To the commenter above, animal cruelty has been a crime for five years now. Also, from a plot perspective, Li Fei's actions were a clear provocation and humiliation of Chen Pin. In the face of imperial power, there really is no difference between a palace maid and a cat. Just enjoy the show and don’t overthink it.]
 

 
[You can only enjoy this kind of thing in movies and shows.]
 

 
[To those overanalyzing, hush! I love watching palace dramas where the villainous female lead crushes everyone! Go, go, go!]
 

 
While this controversial plot stirred debates in the discussion forums, the big data evaluations rated it as quite satisfying.
 

 
Viewers empathized with Tong Zhao’s character. If their pet had been crippled, they would be angry and upset too.
 

 
Slapping back in revenge felt good. Simple as that.
 

 
And when viewers feel satisfied, they will generously reward the show with high ratings and buzz.
 

 
It's so exhilarating!
 

 
They want to keep feeling this thrill!
 

 
※
 

 
*The Chronicles of Emperor Ming* is not a palace intrigue drama, so an antagonist can't survive until the very end.
 

 
When Tong Zhao re-entered the pod, she was filming the scenes where the imperial concubine's fortune takes a downturn.
 

 
As an external relative to the royal family, the Chen family's ambitions had always been high.
 

 
With the Empress unable to bear a legitimate son, they wanted to send another Chen woman into the palace. After the Empress, driven by sheer determination, finally gave birth to a young son, the Chen family even entertained thoughts of rebellion.
 

 
Of course, this rebellion was unsuccessful and served as a major trial for the protagonist, Emperor Ming—one of the main plotlines of the show.
 

 
A major plotline cannot go wrong, so under the tense supervision of the crew, the Chen family embarked on their rebellion with some minor scares but no major mishaps. Predictably, they were lured out and completely taken down by Emperor Ming, who had foreseen the plot all along. The whole family ended up in prison, and the Empress requested to be deposed.
 

 
Being another daughter of the Chen family, Tong Zhao's character became the target of everyone's ire.
 

 
The other concubines in the harem watched with snide comments, eager to see her downfall.
 

 
The crime committed by the Chen family this time was too severe. Her father was one of the main culprits, guilty beyond pardon. The Empress, in the end, was only spared the disgrace by being granted white silk for a dignified end.
 

 
As Tong Zhao's character was nearing her exit, the director was very satisfied: "I'm sure many viewers who watch this show will remember her vividly."
 

 
A distinctive "true self" is very well-received.
 

 
Thinking about fulfilling the wish entrusted by the goddess, the director felt particularly gratified.
 

 
Concubine De, the first to kick someone when they're down, pretended to express regret in front of Emperor Ming, saying that the harem would become lonely without the imperial concubine.
 

 
Emperor Ming frowned:
 

 
"What nonsense are you talking about? I never intended to have her executed."
# Chapter8
Concubine De was dumbfounded.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff were also stunned.
 

 
They hadn't considered the possibility that Emperor Ming might not want to have Tong Zhao killed. When "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" cast Song Wanzhuo, it was because his "true self" was such a perfect fit for the role. Emperor Ming would not be foolish on major issues; the Chen family had committed a grave crime, and how could the public be satisfied if the Chen clan was not punished?
 

 
The Empress received only a white silk, so what could the Imperial Concubine expect?
 

 
Moreover, many of the palace concubines and their factions were hoping for her death to make room for newcomers, and the previous dynasty had put a lot of pressure on Emperor Ming.
 

 
The scriptwriter had written the role of this female character as merely a tool to allow the protagonist to transform once more into a ruthless ruler.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Uh, this..."
 

 
Since, aside from the main character and the major stars who could negotiate a share of the profits, the performance fees were generally agreed upon in advance—paying per episode, with budgets not easily altered—the plot's outcome was set firmly. If the script called for the character to die by the seventh episode, the eighth episode would only show a memorial portrait if she appeared at all.
 

 
Everyone looked at each other in confusion.
 

 
The lighting technician cautiously suggested, "If you can't have her die, maybe add a temporary script change and have Tong Zhao die of illness instead?"
 

 
This was also a solution, though it was somewhat contrived.
 

 
"Let's wait and see for a while," said the director, and the group stopped discussing, secretly hoping no more issues would arise.
 

 
……
 

 
Emperor Ming really didn't want to kill her.
 

 
Since "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" had many serious scenes, Tong Zhao's role was not major. However, if the scenes of their interactions were edited separately, anyone with a bit of experience could see how sweet and affectionate their relationship was. The Imperial Concubine knew exactly how to win Emperor Ming's favor, always managing to calm him down. They had only known each other for a year, still within the honeymoon period, and he was extremely reluctant.
 

 
This was actually something Tong Zhao had anticipated before getting into character.
 

 
She had read the script, knew how her character would die, and expected that the Emperor would be reluctant to kill her.
 

 
After all, "Concubine Chen" was a persona she created with great effort in the ancient palace. If she couldn’t even win over an emperor, she couldn’t claim to be a beloved concubine and might as well find another field to farm.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was confident and calm before stepping into character.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "Concubine Chen's" mission was to become the Emperor's idealized memory after his death, once her favorability reached 100, she would find a suitable way to die. This self-destructive tendency was deeply buried in her memory, like a code waiting to be triggered at the right moment.
 

 
……
 

 
In the palace.
 

 
Concubine Chen not only did not lower her status but instead dressed exquisitely every day, making the other concubines envious of her regal appearance.
 

 
Even with her eyes narrowed like a rabbit's, it was useless; the Emperor loved her regardless.
 

 
"Yuzhi, I've been dreaming lately about the things my sister said to me before her death."
 

 
The senior maid beside Concubine Chen quickly knelt and said reassuringly, "Your Majesty, those were just the ramblings of someone who knew they had no way to deal with you. If she really had any power over you, it wouldn't have ended up like this."
 

 
Concubine Chen's palace was tightly controlled, and her behavior was so arrogant that even her servants who had followed her into the palace had picked up some of her haughty attitude. Even after death, in Yuzhi's words, she was just a blabbering fool who wanted to curse the esteemed Concubine Chen!
 

 
Before the white silk was placed, the Empress cursed Concubine Chen fiercely: "Unfaithful, unfilial, and treacherous seductress, how long can you keep the Emperor's favor with your looks? I’ll be waiting for you down there…" She sneered bitterly, "Waiting for you to fall from favor and into ruin…”
 

 
The Empress resented the rebellious concubine, resented the Emperor's indifference, and also resented the Chen family's ambition and disregard for her situation in the palace.
 

 
"Your Majesty, don’t be afraid. Should I ask the Imperial Physician for a calming remedy?"
 

 
"Afraid of her?" Concubine Chen laughed dismissively. "I’ve never been afraid since entering the palace. If I wasn’t afraid while I was alive, I certainly wouldn’t be afraid after death. As for martial skills, my sister is no match for me."
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
She had originally been just a side branch of the Chen family, unlike her elder sister who was destined to become a consort. She had climbed trees as a child and later learned to dance to win the Emperor's favor. Despite her slender limbs, she was strong, and even in the afterlife, Concubine Chen was confident she could overpower her sister.
 

 
Concubine Chen closed her eyes, and her smile faded slightly. "I had only hoped to fight for a lifetime."
 

 
The afternoon sunlight streamed through the paper windows and fell on her skin, which was as delicate as white jade, making her appear as if she was glowing.
 

 
A subplot was added to the main story: Concubine Chen had someone bring her some poison. The palace maids and eunuchs thought nothing of it. Their mistress had always been known for her pranks, like sprinkling itching powder, and even if she did manage to kill someone, what did it matter? However, they had never seen her cause a miscarriage or the death of a prince.
 

 
It seemed that the Empress's concerns were never about offspring.
 

 
Returning to the previous dynasty.
 

 
The Chen family's rebellion and the threat from an external enemy ran parallel to each other. To gain the support of another prominent clan, the Emperor had to execute the troublemaker. After the Emperor's furious reaction, he realized for the first time that being an Emperor wasn't as free and easy as he had thought. This further solidified his resolve to consolidate all power back into his own hands with the help of his trusted aides, the second and third male leads.
 

 
Although they had never met, the second and third male leads despised Concubine Chen, believing she was the cause of their problems. One scene depicted them discussing Concubine Chen, lamenting that she was indeed just an ignorant woman who refused to die for the greater good.
 

 
The director pondered, "These lines will definitely anger female viewers. Concubine Chen is a genuine scapegoat. She spends her days enjoying herself with palace maids, playing with cats and dogs, and at most, bullying other consorts. Why should she be punished with death?"
 

 
A staff member commented, "Well, that's male subconsciousness for you. It's not too extreme."
 

 
Previously, there had been public outcry over a middle-aged male actor's assertion that cheating was not a crime and that wives should be understanding. Despite the backlash, he garnered loyal support from a segment of male viewers and continued to do well.
 

 
In the study, the Emperor and the male leads were discussing state affairs when the chief steward, trembling, entered to inform the Emperor that Concubine Chen had requested an audience. She claimed that, although she was unworthy of the Emperor's favor, she had practiced a new dance and hoped to see His Majesty smile.
 

 
Concubine Chen's tone was mocking. The implication was that if the Emperor did not attend, it meant she was unworthy, and she would be heartbroken.
 

 
The faces of the two officials immediately darkened.
 

 
Screenwriter: “…”
 

 
Screenwriter: “I spent all night thinking about the plot in the Emperor’s study.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “My condolences.”
 

 
At this point, everyone on the backstage was wondering when Concubine Chen would die.
 

 
The second and third male leads were also thinking the same thing.
 

 
They wished they could personally shove a poisoned meal into her mouth.
 

 
At this moment, the more arrogant second male lead suggested that they should go together, enjoying the dance while discussing affairs, so as not to delay official matters. The third male lead immediately gave him a look, signaling him not to be too excessive. Even though their relationship was like that of close comrades, this was still too disrespectful.
 

 
The Emperor's expression remained calm, showing no sign of joy or anger. He simply asked Steward Hai to check if Concubine Chen would agree to allow the two ministers to enjoy the performance together.
 

 
Concubine Chen agreed.
 

 
The intention to humiliate the troublemaker was clear, but no one expected the woman to be so thick-skinned.
 

 
Since the ministers were going, it was naturally not appropriate to hold the event in Concubine Chen's quarters.
 

 
The palace had many places, so a suitable garden at the boundary was chosen, and a stage was set up.
 

 
“New dance? Where’s the new dance? We didn’t give her a new dance template,” the template designer suddenly realized the key issue. Some roles required unique skills to be demonstrated, and if the actor couldn’t perform them, a template or MOD had to be used. “Does Tong Zhao know how to dance?”
 

 
Everyone turned to the only person who knew Tong Zhao.
 

 
The director hesitated, “I think she studied ballet? I’ve seen her perform Swan Lake before.”
 

 
...
 

 
On-screen, Concubine Chen appeared gracefully in a water-red dance outfit.
 

 
The three men in the audience instinctively straightened their backs.
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
Her face, shaped like an egg, was adorned with vibrant makeup. Her almond-shaped eyes, with a hint of rosy hue at the corners, resembled a celestial maiden descending from the heavens. Unlike a goddess who was aloof and untouchable, she was alluring in a way that made one want to intrude.
 

 
The Emperor showed a hint of regret on his face.
 

 
He shouldn’t have let these two men enjoy the performance to prove how exceptional his beloved concubine was.
 

 
However, there was no time for him to regret it, as Concubine Chen had already begun dancing.
 

 
It was indeed a new dance.
 

 
None of the three had seen it before, nor had the template designer. It was not Swan Lake.
 

 
It was a delicate dance from another realm, performed by Concubine Chen before the Emperor, featuring delicate silver bells on her hands and ankles. The jingling of the bells created a crisp sound that cut through the seductive atmosphere with a tinkle of gold and jade.
 

 
“... If this segment is cut out on its own, Tong Zhao will definitely become popular.”
 

 
Someone muttered in a daze.
 

 
“It’s not a matter of whether she will become popular or not; the Emperor truly won’t have the heart to let her die,” the director sighed. “Let’s arrange for an urgent illness plotline.”
 

 
Concubine Chen had boasted that no man could resist her.
 

 
At that moment, everyone who saw her felt her bewitching charm. She was exquisitely beautiful, evoking a sense of wonder about what she had endured. It was as if she had crushed herself and fiercely burned away the remaining fragrance, yet it still lingered with a bittersweet allure that left hearts entranced.
 

 
After the dance, Concubine Chen deeply bowed, as if about to perform a kneeling ritual.
 

 
The Emperor suddenly stood up, hurried forward to help her, and gently lifted her chin. He saw a pale, exquisitely beautiful face hidden beneath the makeup. She parted her lips and said, "Your Majesty..." before spitting out a small amount of blood.
 

 
The Emperor was both shocked and anxious, immediately sending for the imperial physician.
 

 
"Please, Your Majesty, don’t make things difficult for yourself," Concubine Chen's eyes shone brightly, surpassing even the fireworks at the coronation ceremony: "I want you to always remember me, remember that I am your Wanwan, and love me..."
 

 
Her voice weakened, and upon seeing the Emperor’s face, she showed a pained expression, shaking her head and sighing: "Forget me, just forget me."
 

 
The poison was prepared for her.
 

 
In the parting love, there was no truth. The underlying message of “I don’t want to delay you” was “Don’t delay me, just leave quickly.”
 

 
“Forget me” was actually “You must remember me.”
 

 
She wanted him to never again hear the sound of jingling bells.
 

 
In her life, Concubine Chen had loved only two people.
 

 
One was her sister, the empress, who was a model for all women in the family, and who had urged her to enter the palace to bear children.
 

 
The other was herself.
 

 
...
 

 
The backstage after the shoot was silent.
 

 
The screenwriter trembled, "Um, I need to explain to the audience that this scene with the knife wasn’t written by me. Will they believe it?"
# Chapter9
Huff!
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her eyes, sat up straight in the filming room, and let out a long sigh.
 

 
The other actors were still in the room with their eyes closed.
 

 
Only actors who died in the scene would wake up early. Everything was still going according to her plan; the character of Shen Guifei had died.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at Song Wanzhuo in the adjacent room.
 

 
A line of transparent liquid slowly slid from the corner of his eye.
 

 
Although her memory hadn’t fully returned, it seemed Shen Guifei's death was quite impactful.
 

 
There was a glass window through which she could see the backstage of the shoot. Tong Zhao looked up and waved to the monitoring window, signaling that she was in good condition and would be out soon. The director smiled at her, but the screenwriter’s gaze was rather subtle.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked out and took a moment backstage to thank everyone.
 

 
The filming style of "Instinct" was quite different from before; it didn’t build deep connections with the crew through each scene. After all, the actors spent most of their time in another “world,” and since she was just a guest star with her character’s role done, it was time for her to leave.
 

 
"Let's have a chance to work together next time."
 

 
"You'll remember later, I didn’t expect you to dance so well, Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"Enough with the pleasantries, let’s add each other on WeChat first!"
 

 
The comment jolted everyone awake.
 

 
People quickly pulled out their QR codes to scan, and within minutes, Tong Zhao had added a lot of new contacts, all categorized under [Work] in her list.
 

 
The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
Firstly, there were no conflicts of interest; secondly, they thought she performed exceptionally well and was bound to become popular soon. Even if they couldn’t benefit from her immediately, having a future big star in their contact list was advantageous.
 

 
As she mechanically added new friends, Tong Zhao recalled how she had quietly left the set of "The Tale of Emperor Ming" in her previous life, fading away without making a sound. Only Director Jian Shu sighed and gave her work advice.
 

 
The same place, different treatment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not lament the fickleness of human nature; she was simply satisfied that the changes she made were the right ones.
 

 
---
 

 
"The Tale of Emperor Ming" is still airing.
 

 
But besides the main plot, a mysterious force has quietly emerged and become a striking feature in the viewer comments—Ming Chen and Chen Ming shippers.
 

 
A male and a female, but why is there a sequence?
 

 
Fans of the former shipper are all about the handsome emperor and his delicate consort.
 

 
Fans of the latter are all about the domineering beauty and the befuddled, lovesick emperor she has ensnared.
 

 
Among them, Song Wanzhuo's fans are the most quickly captivated.
 

 
They worry, “Will my brother really fall in love with her?”, while also thinking, “Ah, but the domineering and affectionate brother is so charming!” They found that viewing from the perspective of Consort Chen made the experience so much better, especially delightful!
 

 
What about the main plot?
 

 
This segment of the audience turned on double speed for the main plot and only returned to normal speed when Consort Chen appeared. In the script’s setting, this romantic subplot was just sugary fluff mixed in with the main course. But now, it’s like the audience kicked the whole banquet over and made the pastries the main course—sweet, sweet, sweet.
 

 
[Life is already so bitter; I just want to eat sweets.]
 

 
[It’s not just about the sweetness; I love watching Consort Chen slap faces online. Seeing her flaunt her power is so much fun! Since she’s not the main character, I worried she might suffer, but it seems Tong Zhao’s “true self” is quite domineering.]
 

 
[Not just domineering!]
 

 
---
 

 
This made the audience who were originally focused on the serious plot of **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** feel a bit uneasy.
 

 
The drama was overshadowed by the side plot.
 

 
As a result, apart from discussing the sweet moments and the plot, the comment section of the viewer's bullet chat started to fill with sour comments, especially from female viewers.
 

 
[If you want to enjoy sugary moments, go watch a romance drama! This is a historical drama; some female viewers should just back off and stop making me say unpleasant things.]
 

 
[Actually, I’ve always thought it’s good that the audience gender ratio for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is somewhat skewed, since they don't understand it anyway :D]
 

 
Anyone surfing the internet has some sense of the underlying hostility.
 

 
The targeted groups weren’t going to take it lying down, so they began to retaliate:
 

 
[No way, no way. Could there really be people who think women don’t deserve to watch historical dramas?]
 

 
[It’s quite strange. This year, the gender ratio of viewers for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is almost even. Do you think TV dramas don’t want female viewers because they’re making too much money? Are you trying to sabotage your own show? Does your master know?]
 

 
The argument ironically brought another wave of attention to the drama. Oddly, even though the debate was fierce, the criticism wasn’t directed at Tong Zhao or Consort Chen.
 

 
By the next day, the official data came out and revealed the truth.
 

 
In the era of big data, each viewer's consent before watching a show has already defaulted to data collection. The producers pay close attention to who in the show is the key to retaining viewers. With data analysis, nothing escapes scrutiny—whether a particular plot was frequently fast-forwarded or which scenes were watched repeatedly.
 

 
To get accurate numbers, the official system has a data fraud detection mechanism. Fans' mechanical repeat viewings are not counted, so the released data is the genuine version and cannot be deceived.
 

 
When the data came out, the people who had been arguing were stunned.
 

 
The ratio of male to female viewers repeatedly watching Consort Chen’s scenes was 7:3.
 

 
Male 7, Female 3.
 

 
[Oh wow…]
 

 
[Alright, there’s no difference between the dog emperor and the dog man.]
 

 
[As long as it’s a man’s show, whether in the drama or outside, does Consort Chen’s sister slay the whole scene? I almost vomited from laughing so hard at last night’s leftovers.]
 

 
Right after this, Tong Zhao thought the long-dead system had suddenly come back to life.
 

 
And it came back with two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s passive skill “Favorite Consort Aura”: Male viewers will view your work through a filter because no man can resist the charm of Consort Chen.]
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s active skill “Overwhelming Beauty”: No matter the angle or attire, Consort Chen is always the most stunning! Activation Condition - At least three women present.]
 

 
……
 

 
They were all very useful, making their way to becoming major beauties in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, am I about to undertake another mission? Or is it something else?]
 

 
System: [The host has completed all tasks in the small worlds. The system will no longer require the host to solve any tasks with annihilation as a punishment.]
 

 
After the explanation, the system fell silent.
 

 
Tong Zhao breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
After all, this is her life, and she wants to live it according to her own wishes.
 

 
Consort Chen was delightfully wicked; not only had she kickstarted Zhao Zhao’s entertainment career, but she had also activated useful skills. She was practically the most contributive one at home: [In the past, Zhao Zhao, you should have promoted me.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang coolly responded: [The consort has been promoted as much as possible. Just kill her.]
 

 
※
 

 
"Chronicles of the Ming Emperor" became increasingly popular, with viewership numbers rising.
 

 
Data showed that the character of Consort Chen was exceptionally likable, and the audience wanted to see Tong Zhao!
 

 
However, rumors spread that someone on set saw Tong Zhao leaving in a cab.
 

 
In other words, Consort Chen had met her end.
 

 
How could this be!
 

 
The fans firmly refused to accept it and demanded to see the sweet ending!
 

 
But as the episodes aired day by day, the audience began to sense something was amiss—Chen’s family’s plot to rebel gave Consort Chen a clear reason to meet her end according to ancient standards. Reluctantly, the audience began speculating about how she would die.
 

 
[It’ll probably be death by imperial decree.]
 

 
[Just look at the content of the old lady's substantial bribe to gain entry into the palace. She wanted Consort Chen to die to ensure Chen’s family’s survival, trading death for exile. It seems clear who the Emperor’s favorite truly is.]
 

 
[If it’s really due to family pressure, while it makes sense, Consort Chen’s character would lose its appeal.]
 

 
Despite the speculation, no one really wanted to see Consort Chen die.
 

 
So when the Emperor said he had no intention of granting Consort Chen’s death, the CP fans breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
See, the Emperor couldn’t bear to kill his little darling!
 

 
However, the pressure from the previous dynasty cast a shadow over the harem.
 

 
Attentive viewers noticed that Consort Chen mentioned the Empress more frequently. Since the Empress was given a white silk for her demise, Consort Chen's tone when referring to her sister had softened considerably, carrying a vague sense of regret. Some felt this was because, with the death, the grievances were forgotten, while others thought Consort Chen’s tone not only lacked hatred but also carried a hint of affection...
 

 
Affection?
 

 
How could that be? The woman who was fixated on her own child.
 

 
Distracted by this mysterious sisterly bond, the audience even felt relieved when they saw Consort Chen practicing her dance while asking for poison—see, the Consort still had the energy to harm others, she must be quite lively!
 

 
The audience watched with smiles as Consort Chen performed a dance for Emperor Ming.
 

 
The director, using all his skills, switched camera angles and zoomed in and out, allowing the audience to experience the Emperor’s perspective and become captivated by the beauty’s every move and smile, temporarily forgetting the oppressive storyline of the previous dynasty. Indeed, despite the transient adversity and gloom, Consort Chen would always be tenderly waiting in the harem, and the Emperor was determined to protect both the empire and the Consort...
 

 
As they watched this scene, the audience, in unison, displayed a blissful, drunken-like smile.
 

 
[Wuwuwu, Consort Chen is absolutely stunning!]
 

 
[No matter the floods of the previous dynasty, I just want my Consort Chen to enjoy herself every day!]
 

 
[I wonder what expression the Emperor and the two ministers have now…]
 

 
[To the person above, why don’t you look in the mirror?]
 

 
As the dance concluded, with Emperor Ming catching the fainting Consort Chen and seeing her spitting blood in his arms, the audience’s smiles froze on their faces.
 

 
Seeing Consort Chen’s final words, the audience’s smiles gradually faded.
 

 
Then, Consort Chen took her last breath.
 

 
The character's inner monologue could be extracted, but during filming, it wasn’t directly heard by the director and was only included in post-production and selectively broadcast. And Consort Chen’s final thoughts were broadcasted.
 

 
[In this lifetime, Consort Chen loved only two people.
 

 
One was her elder sister, the model for all women in the family, whom her family wanted her to enter the palace to bear children for.
 

 
The other was herself.]
 

 
......???
 

 
Where is the dog emperor???
 

 
The audience, who had just been left with a bitter taste, was stunned.
 

 
Perhaps anticipating the reaction after this episode aired, the production team quietly posted a "behind-the-scenes" photo on their official Weibo—
 

 
@TVSeriesMingEmperorExtra:
 

 
The Emperor is also crying with you [dog head emoji]
 

 
Attached was a photo of Song Wanzhuo with her eyes closed and tears streaming in the capsule.
# Chapter10
Song Wanzhuo was miserable.
 

 
When he woke up from the holographic pod, the tears in the corner of his eyes had already dried. He didn't even realize that he had been crying; he just felt an emptiness inside. How to describe that feeling...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was quite self-absorbed, with high standards for women, and had entered the entertainment industry early, so he had never been in a serious relationship. All his past flings were light-hearted and didn't leave any scars. He didn’t understand that this feeling was called losing someone he loved. While enduring the subtle gazes of the other staff members and rubbing his chin with one hand, he finally figured out what this feeling was when he returned to his room!
 

 
It was like... finding out that all the jungle monsters were cleared when playing a jungler in a game.
 

 
Or when playing mid-lane, the minion wave was pushed by the support.
 

 
Or shipping the wrong CP (couple pairing) when watching *Naruto* and *Bleach*.
 

 
A sense of melancholy, discomfort, and a feeling of never wanting to love again.
 

 
It wasn’t until the next day, during a rest day, when the memories of the movie "Instinct" came flooding back, that Song Wanzhuo clutched his chest and sat up.
 

 
"Damn!"
 

 
"My beloved consort is dead!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo moved his hand from his chest to his left cheek, let out a sob, and started to cry.
 

 
All the little moments they had shared flooded his mind, as if he had been hit with countless blows, making him see stars. His mind was filled with Consort Chen, and he even had a strange thought—it's all because *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* is a historical drama. If he had met Consort Chen in modern times, he would have resisted all the pressure from fans and married her as his wife!
 

 
"Ugh... What the hell is wrong with me..."
 

 
Overwhelmed.
 

 
Completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo grabbed his phone and dialed his agent's number. "Bro, my wife died!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Woken up at seven in the morning, the agent groggily answered, "When did you get married?"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo briefly explained the situation.
 

 
Oh, so he just couldn't get out of character.
 

 
Recalling the amount of commission Song Wanzhuo earned for him in the first half of the year, the agent's tone became more patient. "So, what do you want to do about it?"
 

 
"I want to time-travel to the modern era and date Consort Chen. I want to give her happiness. She loves me so much, but I can't give her anything..." With a slightly stuffy nose, Song Wanzhuo sounded just like a heartbroken young man. "I'm heartbroken! This is my first time being heartbroken at my age! I can't lose her!"
 

 
Suddenly, the agent was wide awake.
 

 
That evening, when Song Wanzhuo logged onto Weibo and saw that his crying photo had been posted as a behind-the-scenes snippet, his mature mindset completely collapsed.
 

 
Wah, women are all liars!
 

 
And so, the world had one more man heartbroken over Consort Chen.
 

 
※
 

 
The role of Consort Chen received a great response, which indeed gave Tong Zhao a good start.
 

 
Her type of "true self" character is quite rare, and invitations to audition for palace drama roles and female characters with femme fatale personas poured in like snowflakes. Even after Sister Chu filtered out some poorly conceived projects that were completely out of consideration, there were still quite a few options left.
 

 
After all, the demand for these types of dramas was immense.
 

 
However, since Tong Zhao was still a newcomer, there were only two roles where she would have significant screen time.
 

 
"One is the female lead, and the other is the second female lead."
 

 
Tong Zhao took a look.
 

 
The whole "family" in her mind peeked out as well.
 

 
"The Story of Consort Xi" tells the story of an orphan girl who enters the palace as a stand-in for her legitimate sister and climbs her way up to become an imperial consort.
 

 
"Palace Heart as Priority"
 

 
The first and second female leads are sisters. When they first entered the palace, they thought they would rely on each other for survival. However, the second sister was blinded by the overwhelming power and glory, gradually becoming corrupted and advancing her status by harming others. When the elder sister became the empress, the second sister even wanted to kill her and take her place. In the end, evil does not prevail over good. The merciful elder sister spared her from the death penalty and sent her to a temple to spend her days with ancient Buddha statues and oil lamps.
 

 
Consort Chen: "The first one is still passable, but what is the second one? Forget it. If I were playing the role, that Empress sister wouldn't survive past the third episode. I'd send her off joyfully the moment she gains favor."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Have you noticed that these two scripts have something in common?"
 

 
Consort Chen: "What is it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Everyone loves watching you play out sisterly yuri (girl-love) dramas."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Back in the palace... Forget it, let’s not talk about that world. Ever since I met Immortal Master Lu, I knew I would never be interested in women again in this lifetime.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped through the scripts for a while.
 

 
They were clearly targeting her recent popularity with the "empress-consort yuri vibe," but she didn't want to keep repeating herself—having multiple personalities was her advantage, and milking one personality dry would be like crippling her own skills. Although it was a pity to give up such easy opportunities, Tong Zhao still tossed those two scripts aside.
 

 
Why doesn't anyone dare to give her something different?
 

 
※
 

 
Halfway through the filming of the first season of *Star-Selected Girls*...
 

 
The members were given a week off and could return to modern life with internet access.
 

 
Xu Zhu was in a pretty good mood initially.
 

 
During the break, she could go shopping at the mall using the secondary card provided by Father Tong, and return to the Tong residence to enjoy the princess room that Tong Zhao used to live in, without having to squeeze into a dorm with those poor fellow trainees and go online to see how many new fans she had gained...
 

 
Her good mood ended the moment she got online.
 

 
Xu Zhu's WeChat messages exploded, all urging her to watch *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*.
 

 
"OMG, Xu Zhu, your sister's performance as the Consort is amazing! How did she land such a perfect role? Was it thanks to your dad? That's incredible. Other people hit countless walls before landing a role that fits them so well..."
 

 
"Ahhh, please reply to my message!"
 

 
What made Xu Zhu's heart tighten the most was a message from Ning Zhiyi, Tong Zhao's childhood friend and ex-boyfriend—
 

 
"Zhuzhu, have you watched *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*? Is the rumor about her and Song Wanzhuo true?"
 

 
After all her secret efforts, Ning Zhiyi not only broke up with the proud and stubborn Tong Zhao but also became very close to her (Xu Zhu). But now, he was concerned about whether Tong Zhao's rumored romance was true... Wait a minute, Song Wanzhuo? Brother Wanzhuo? How did they end up together? She clearly heard that after the first audition, Brother Wanzhuo was in a bad mood and wanted to replace Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu was furious and opened both Weibo and news about Tong Zhao at the same time.
 

 
Every single headline was so dazzling that it hurt her eyes.
 

 
"The Enchanting Consort Tong Zhao, the first woman to evoke real feelings in Song Wanzhuo, makes her debut."
 

 
"Unfiltered Version: Tong Zhao as Consort Chen - Scene Highlights."
 

 
"Consort Chen's Charming Bell Dance in Ultra HD (For the holographic version, please visit Channel 2 for paid viewing)."
 

 
"Epic Highlight: Consort Chen Slays in the Harem."
 

 
#SongWanzhuoTongZhao#
 

 
As Xu Zhu browsed through the topics related to Tong Zhao, seeing people genuinely discussing and praising her, Xu Zhu's chest rose and fell continuously. Drinking two sips of ice water only made her feel more nauseous. Memories flooded back—the two of them growing up as close as sisters, and in terms of appearance, academics, or talents, Tong Zhao always outshone her.
 

 
Xu Zhu blamed it all on Tong Zhao having a good mother.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother was beautiful, so her skin and features were better.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother married well, so she could live like a little princess.
 

 
Fortunately, Xu Zhu's mother won once and took it all back.
 

 
With Tong Zhenming's support, Xu Zhu felt she could finally surpass Tong Zhao in the entertainment industry!
 

 
However, the harsh reality hit her in the face. Tong Zhao's subconscious wasn't crushed by repeated blows; instead, she stood up, amazed the audience, and made them praise her "true self" for its strength...
 

 
The movie *Instinct* is a vast free market, and a ban is impossible.
 

 
The Tong family couldn't manage it, and Xu Zhu certainly didn't have the power to do so either.
 

 
Xu Zhu racked her brain, desperately thinking of a way to pull Tong Zhao down.
 

 
She couldn't think of anything.
 

 
Finally, when her peripheral vision caught sight of Ning Zhiyi's WeChat message to her, Xu Zhu had a sudden flash of inspiration and realized the key—Tong Zhao could play Consort Chen so well because her true nature was to seduce men. So, why not cast her in a completely opposite role? Dig a pit for her and mislead her.
 

 
#TongZhao#
 

 
#ZhangMengTongZhao#
 

 
Due to Consort Chen's final inner monologue elevating the hidden bond of sisterhood, a new CP (couple pairing) fanbase suddenly emerged, generating some discussion. Actually, the topic of #StarSelectedGirlsXuZhu# wasn't unpopular either, but Xu Zhu knew very well that it was all backed by a marketing company putting in paid efforts…
 

 
With a direction in mind, Xu Zhu's brain calmed down.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn't that stupid.
 

 
But what if it was a great opportunity?
 

 
She could tell the production team that her sister was actually very strong and independent in private; as long as they gave her a template to follow, she could play the role well. She could also promise that the Tong family would help invest in marketing and promotion. Xu Zhu already had this level of authority, given to her by Tong Zhenming...


 
At worst, she could offer Tong Zhao a female lead role.
 

 
Thanks to the Tong family’s connections working behind the scenes, Xu Zhu had quite a few scripts to choose from. However, none of them offered the first female lead; nobody dared to give such a crucial role to a newbie who had never starred in an instinct movie. The available roles were all ones that lacked difficulty. Xu Zhu went through all the scripts that the Tong family could influence and finally found an invitation.
 

 
A semi-reality apocalypse movie, *Countdown: 72 Hours*.
 

 
The role offered to Xu Zhu was that of the female lead's younger sister, a sweet and innocent character.
 

 
"This one is good."
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't overestimate herself; she felt that a character who screams for help whenever faced with trouble suited her just fine.
 

 
The female lead in *Countdown: 72 Hours* is a strong, emotionally detached woman who leads her sister to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, with a mission to complete in three days. This type of reality show-style movie became a trend after the rise of holographic consciousness filming. The audience watches the live stream online, and it is the genre where the director has the least ability to interfere.
 

 
Xu Zhu thought through the details carefully; she believed convincing the production team wouldn’t be a problem.
 

 
The problem was—
 

 
"Sigh, that woman probably won’t accept the invitation. She should just keep doing palace dramas."
 

 
Xu Zhu dug a pit with no hope of success.
# Chapter11
Tong Zhao was unaware of her stepsister's covert actions.
 

 
Even if she knew, she couldn't be bothered.
 

 
Since the role of Consort Chen became popular, all the comments on her Weibo were warmly calling her "Consort." Consort Chen was quite pleased, though Han Zhi, who managed her Weibo, was a bit frustrated: "It used to be 'brother' only."
 

 
Female reporter Liang Liang joked: "Not just that; there are also many men in the comments."
 

 
The fans attracted by Consort Chen were mostly boyfriend and husband types. With ambitions of rising to fame and marrying a gentle wife, what man with big aspirations wouldn't want a charming wife like Tong Zhao? Of course, it's just a dream—marrying her is impossible, but enjoying her performances will have to do.
 

 
The problem is, there are no new works.
 

 
They could only revisit existing clips, getting obsessed.
 

 
[Where’s the agent? Where’s the company? Hurry up and get Consort Chen new roles. Even if there are no new dramas, variety shows and interviews would do, right? They don’t even know how to dig up treasure when it’s in their hands. I’m done with this.]
 

 
[I can’t believe no one is offering Consort Chen any palace drama roles. Could it be they are too picky?]
 

 
[I’m going to die if I don’t see Consort Chen! Consort Chen, please post a selfie soon!]
 

 
The empress is anxious, not the emperor, fearing that Tong Zhao might waste her stunning start.
 

 
Tong Zhao's life has been quite fulfilling. Since her return, she has consistently practiced meditation and slow cultivation, finally achieving the effect of cleansing her bones and marrow. Her appearance has subtly improved again—she still looks like herself, but her skin can withstand any external damage. Even after ten hours of wind, rain, and sun, she still looks as smooth and flawless as jade in photos.
 

 
After the role of Consort Chen became popular, some former wealthy friends reached out to her, all celebrating and congratulating her. Tong Zhao found there was a bit of a generation gap between them, so she mostly laughed it off. The only message that caught her attention was from Wei Zekai, the only son of the Wei family.
 

 
"Tong Zhao, are you free to accompany me to the jewelry exhibition on Sunday?"
 

 
"Come on, please reply to my message. I told them that we're good friends and you could be invited, but they don’t believe it."
 

 
The Wei family is indeed very wealthy.
 

 
Wei Zekai is great in many ways, except for being narcissistic and a bit of a smart mouth. He was very loyal and had helped Tong Zhao many times in her difficult moments. However, due to Xu Zhu's manipulations and the resulting misunderstandings between them—one being unwilling to explain and the other being sensitive and fragile—they eventually fell out.
 

 
Tong Zhao is one to remember both grudges and favors.
 

 
Not recognizing good intentions in her youth, she feels the need to repay them now that she has returned.
 

 
"Sure, but I've fallen out with my family, so I don’t have suitable clothes for formal occasions. You'll have to arrange something for me."
 

 
"No problem!"
 

 
After agreeing on the meeting time, Tong Zhao recalled the jewelry exhibition in her mind.
 

 
...
 

 
In her past life, when she had ruined the Consort Chen role and was wallowing in despair in a small apartment, Wei Zekai had come with his cleaning company to help her tidy up and find a solution. However, at that time, Tong Zhao had failed to grasp the helping hand of her friend and didn't remember the invitation. She had never actually attended.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao was doing well, it was understandable why Wei Zekai’s invitation was so flattering.
 

 
He probably wanted to show off.
 

 
—My friend is amazing and has become a big star!
 

 
—I heard many people want to see her but can’t? Only this young master can get her out!
 

 
—Ha, I’m so awesome.
 

 
Tong Zhao could see through his thoughts clearly and smiled.
 

 
On Sunday, Wei Zekai indeed arrived in his Lamborghini to pick up Tong Zhao.
 

 
A seven-figure sports car was parked prominently in front of the residential area, and when the person saw Tong Zhao, he frowned. “Tong Zhao, you live in a place like this? Did your salary get swallowed up and you didn’t tell me?”
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tone was arrogant and mixed with disbelief.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how his relationships never lasted long, likely due to his low emotional intelligence.
 

 
Interpreting his words with some understanding, it meant, “This place is too rundown for you. If your salary has been swallowed up, just say so. I can help.”
 

 
“Ordinary working-class people should live here. How much can I earn from a guest role? Just getting some furniture will do,” Tong Zhao said calmly as she got into the passenger seat, reminding him, “Last time you asked me to remind you to avoid speaking too harshly. Try using a more emotionally intelligent approach.”
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment: “The place you live... it’s quite interesting.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled at him indulgently.
 

 
She thought, sigh, how naïve.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s casual outfit, Wei Zekai asked her, “Where do you get your styling done? Which place do you usually use?”
 

 
Previously, when Tong Zhao had a driver, Wei Zekai was naturally unaware.
 

 
She gave him an address, and Wei Zekai took her to a well-hidden styling salon. The staff here recognized Miss Tong immediately, and a stylist she was familiar with greeted her with a smile. Tong Zhao still had a significant balance on her membership card here, but Wei Zekai, not knowing the details, worried that her balance might run out. To avoid any awkwardness if asked whether she needed a top-up, he directly charged 100,000 yuan to the account: “You’re here to accompany me, so it should be on my account.”
 

 
In reality, among this group of rich second-generation individuals, who haven’t been rebellious and had their card suspended by their family? They all rely on their friends for support. Tong Zhao found it amusing to watch Wei Zekai think he was subtly preserving her pride.
 

 
Tong Zhao lay on a massage chair, closing her eyes to relax while the makeup artist worked on her.
 

 
The makeup artist understood her intention and left the eye makeup for last.
 

 
During the waiting period, Wei Zekai went to the men’s lounge to play video games.
 

 
Just as he was about to finish a level, the revolving door behind him was pushed open: “Mr. Wei, Miss Tong is ready.”
 

 
Originally, Wei Zekai intended to just glance over and then turn back to finish the game level first.
 

 
But when he looked over, he couldn’t take his eyes off her.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was already tall, looked even taller in her champagne-colored high heels, which made her legs appear exceptionally long and her aura extraordinary. Since she was only attending an exhibition and an evening event, she had dressed in a more modest pearl-white gown. Her hair, styled in soft waves cascading down her back, was dark and smooth.
 

 
Wei Zekai set down the game controller and quickly walked over to her, wanting to touch the ends of her hair to see if it felt as soft as he imagined.
 

 
“Don’t, big brother,” Tong Zhao said, stopping his hand: “It’s been set with hairspray.”
 

 
“Isn’t it naturally like this?”
 

 
“Who is born with such a perfect hairstyle? Straight men always say nonsense.”
 

 
Wei Zekai clicked his tongue in amazement, looking at Tong Zhao with the same awe as if he had discovered a new continent.
 

 
The gaze didn’t seem to be directed at a beautiful woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao was familiar with this kind of look. Wei Zekai usually had the same expression when seeing a brand-new figure model. If he stared too long, he would likely make a comment. She was curious to hear what Wei Zekai would say next, and a simple “beautiful” would probably exhaust his vocabulary.
 

 
Wei Zekai straightened up and gave a thumbs-up: “Impressive.”
 

 
……
 

 
She underestimated him; Tong Zhao realized.
 

 
The jewelry exhibition was hosted by a well-known domestic jewelry brand. It wasn’t very large, was not open to the public, and required an invitation to enter. Reporters were not allowed in, but Tong Zhao had still informed Chu Jie about it—she wanted to maintain control over her private life but also didn’t want her agent to be the last to know about the news.
 

 
Tong Zhao was accustomed to such events and saw some familiar faces.
 

 
In the past, when she attended similar events, she was the daughter of the Tong family.
 

 
People looked at her, but what they were really looking at was the Tong family; they had no curiosity about a rich young lady who was essentially a blank slate because everything was straightforward and apparent.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was sure that the attention she received was due to her as an individual.
 

 
“Come on, let’s go over and say hello.”
 

 
Wei Zekai accurately pinpointed where the group of rich second-generation people had gathered.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly found it amusing and graciously activated the empress consort’s special skill, “Overwhelm the Crowd with Glamour.”
 

 
Once the buff was activated, Tong Zhao didn’t feel any different.
 

 
Wei Zekai naturally led her in front of his former acquaintances. Tong Zhao knew these people, and they knew her, but the way they looked at her now was as if they had never seen her before!
 

 
Her graceful figure and the lighting at the jewelry exhibition, seemingly designed just for her, illuminated her with an otherworldly aura; she was beautiful from head to toe. Tong Zhao smiled politely at them, and the group of second-generation rich kids instantly softened.
 

 
Even though he had denied any romantic rumors, Wei Zekai still felt very proud.
 

 
His gaze at Tong Zhao now resembled Zhang Fei looking at Guan Yu—
 

 
“What a good buddy!”
 

 
At this moment, a male voice with a hint of anger came from behind them: “Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to see Ning Zhiyi, who was with Xu Zhu.
 

 
He looked at Tong Zhao with disapproval, as if being with someone like Wei Zekai was a very degenerate act. However, his disapproving gaze lasted less than three seconds before turning into a look of astonishment—
 

 
Had Tong Zhao always been this beautiful?
 

 
Xu Zhu nervously tugged at Ning Zhiyi’s sleeve and then timidly addressed them: “Wei Shao, Sister, what are you doing here…?”
 

 
The outward timidity belied the deep jealousy inside.
 

 
Sister was like a cunning fox; despite not having an invitation from their father, she still managed to cling to Wei Shao’s arm and show up boldly!
 

 
Tong Zhao now looked at Ning Zhiyi as if he were a stranger, focusing instead on her stepsister.
 

 
Seeing the confusion on Tong Zhao's beautiful face, the others turned to look at them and Tong Zhao asked, "Do we look like we’re related by blood?" She then frowned slightly, showing some discomfort as if she had been offended.
 

 
The contrast between their faces was like night and day.
 

 
After stepping into the entertainment industry, Xu Zhu’s appearance improved, upgrading from a plain neighborhood girl to a small beauty. However, she was still not on the same level as Tong Zhao. Especially with the aura of her current appearance, not even the expensive jewelry on display could rival her in prominence.
 

 
In comparison...
 

 
The two didn’t look like sisters at all.
 

 
The second-generation rich kids were very straightforward and didn’t see the need to care about Xu Zhu's feelings as an illegitimate daughter: “Not at all. Tong Zhao is much better looking.”
 

 
“I also think they don’t look alike.”
 

 
Hearing the consensus, Xu Zhu’s face showed panic. She frowned in distress, lacking the previous assertiveness she had shown when she came to confront Tong Zhao. She now played the victim. Wei Zekai was even more displeased: “Ning Zhiyi, manage your girlfriend. How did she get here? I drove her here myself.”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu became even more convinced that Tong Zhao, like the Consort, relied on men to succeed.
 

 
Tong Zhao had also said the same thing to Ning Zhiyi.
 

 
It seemed that in their mutual childhood friend’s eyes, Tong Zhao had already fallen from grace!
 

 
Ning Zhiyi looked at Tong Zhao with disappointment: "The way you appear in instinct films can’t deceive anyone. Your true nature is exactly like the Consort’s. I used to think you were different, a very independent girl.”
 

 
Well said.
 

 
If it weren’t inappropriate, Xu Zhu would have really liked to applaud him and ask him to increase the dosage.
 

 
Since the stepsister liked Ning Zhiyi, she would definitely want to prove herself after his provocation and might be more likely to take on the role in the apocalyptic film that didn’t suit her!
 

 
However, in an instant, the charming and graceful Tong Zhao changed.
 

 
While the second-generation rich kids behind her were oblivious, Ning Zhiyi, facing Tong Zhao directly, felt an overwhelming sense of hostility!
 

 
It was like an invisible sword, slicing through the air and pressing against his forehead.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao returned, she has been diligently practicing. Although she hadn’t succeeded in establishing a foundation, she had reached a state of surrounding spiritual energy. Ning Zhiyi’s words had directly awakened the dormant Lu Xianzhang within her, even making the enraged Lu Xianzhang take over her primary personality for half a minute.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, caught off guard, was so startled by the spiritual energy that he collapsed to the ground, his knees buckling.
 

 
[Let me strike him! This person’s words are just like my ex-husband’s!]
# Chapter12
[Lu Xianzhang, calm down!]
 

 
[Zhao Zhao is in a lawful society; she can’t kill people.]
 

 
Everyone tried to persuade her. Unlike usual, the Consort, who often competed with Lu Xianzhang, was now smiling happily and encouraging her: [Yes, increase the intensity. Let him underestimate this palace. So what if he relies on men? I’m a professional at relying on men. I can make the world’s supreme ruler my lapdog. Someone like him doesn’t even deserve to carry Zhao Zhao’s shoes.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, still seething with anger, used invisible sword energy to strike Ning Zhiyi’s knee before returning control to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew Ning Zhiyi wouldn’t be able to stand up for at least a cup of tea.
 

 
“Brother Zhiyi, hey, get up quickly…”
 

 
The scene of Ning Zhiyi collapsing on the spot immediately became the center of attention in the exhibition hall. Xu Zhu anxiously tried to help him up but found she didn’t have the strength. Fortunately, security guards came forward immediately. After confirming that he couldn’t stand up on his own, they had to carry him to the lounge like eagles picking up a chick.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, puzzled, asked, “What’s wrong with him?”
 

 
From the perspective of onlookers, it looked like Ning Zhiyi, who had been boasting, suddenly collapsed onto the floor and couldn’t get up.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Could he have a hidden illness?”
 

 
Second-Generation B: “Ah, we should have recorded that. We missed a great chance to get likes on social media.”
 

 
Second-Generation C: “Xu Zhu is impressive. She and Ning Zhiyi have only been seeing each other for a short time, and already Ning Zhiyi is weak in the knees in broad daylight.”
 

 
?
 

 
Everyone turned their heads in unison to look at the driver.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded in the tone of Young Master Wei: “Didn’t he say I’m the Consort? He should kneel when he sees me.”
 

 
The second-generation people hadn’t expected her to play along so well despite her delicate and otherworldly appearance. But thinking about it, since she gets along so well with Young Master Wei, how could her way of thinking be ordinary? It made sense and was quite amusing.
 

 
Tong Zhao said this while still radiating the aura of the Consort, her almond-shaped eyes holding a faint smile, subtly outlining an expensive kind of allure. Ning Zhiyi was right; a Consort fighting in the harem could only rely on men, but not everyone was worthy of her reliance. Most men who saw her subconsciously felt they only deserved to flatter the Consort.
 

 
“To pay such respect, prostration and all, what about me beside you?” Young Master Wei turned to her and asked.
 

 
This rascal has even learned how to flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao asked in return, “What do you think?”
 

 
Wei Zekai responded with caution, “I’d better keep my distance from you, or I might end up as a eunuch.”
 

 
…Well, what a talent.
 

 
In her previous life, after being heavily impacted, Tong Zhao had withdrawn into her shell like a snail, while Xu Zhu had used her thick skin and social skills to break into the circles of wealthy second-generation elites. Now that she had lived through it again, Tong Zhao thought there would be a generational gap with these second-generation elites. However, after Young Master Wei showed her off around, she found it wasn’t the case. They got along well, and after seeing the confrontation between the two, Young Master Wei assured her that he would never bring Xu Zhu into their circle in the future.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t aiming to hit her stepsister over such trivial matters, but she inadvertently closed the door on Xu Zhu’s entry into the second-generation elite circle.
 

 
After strolling for a while, Wei Zekai noticed her bare hands and asked, “Before you ran away from home, did your dad even take off the jewelry you were wearing?”
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t aware of the severity of his friend’s family issues.
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her emotional undertone cold: “I didn’t want his things. I’m not interested.”
 

 
“Well said,” Wei Zekai casually stopped at a counter selling gemstone watches. “You should appreciate what I give you. I haven’t given you a congratulatory gift for your debut success yet. How about this one?”
 

 
He picked up a starry sky watch.
 

 
The gemstones on the watch face were more striking than time itself, dazzling and attractive, and the price was equally impressive.
 

 
Even among second-generation elites, not many are so casually willing to buy a seven-figure watch for a friend, essentially wearing a car on their wrist. Wei Zekai lamented, “Watches should never be cheap. The more expensive, the better.”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked, “Any insights?”
 

 
Wei Zekai had his own harsh perspective: “When dealing with someone like Ning Zhiyi, you can tell him, ‘My time is worth a million for a full rotation. Our sense of time is very different, and you don’t deserve to have me waste it on you.’”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, but she still didn’t accept the watch.
 

 
Wei Zekai insisted on giving her a debut gift, reasoning that when he first performed in a class play in elementary school, she had also bought him a gift. Since that was a long time ago and Tong Zhao didn’t remember it, she finally relented and accepted a relatively cheaper diamond-studded bracelet watch. It looked quite nice on her slender, delicate wrist.
 

 
The friends also rallied to pool funds to buy her gifts—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, from now on, you’re the only star among us!”
 

 
“Yeah, if we want to invest in movies, it’s better to have an acquaintance than to be a naïve investor.”
 

 
“I say we should get that starry sky watch! Or just buy it; after all, Zhao Zhao has two hands, just right for the left Blue Dragon and the right White Tiger.”
 

 
“I think you’re really the Tiger.”
 

 
Finally, they settled for a sapphire necklace as a congratulatory gift.
 

 
Turning the jewelry exhibition into a shopping spree for friends was a privilege for these second-generation elites. They enjoyed the fun of choosing gifts together, and as soon as the necklace arrived, they urged Tong Zhao to put it on. Her neck was slender and elongated, and her shoulder line was impeccable. The gemstone pendant fell between her collarbones, blue like a tear from her heart.
 

 
With the aura activated, Tong Zhao exuded an ethereal grace.
 

 
However, her slightly shallow eyes, like a cat's, conveyed just the right amount of aloofness. Even if someone had watched *The Emperor Ming's Legend* and was overwhelmed by the impulse to pile all the world’s treasures in front of her, they still wouldn’t dare pursue her.
 

 
The Consort Shen felt puzzled: *“I have this strange feeling that ministers from the previous dynasty are partnering to send gifts to me…”*
 

 
Tong Zhao was both amused and touched. She didn’t just accept gifts without reciprocation; she promised that once she became familiar with the entertainment industry, she would definitely bring everyone along to earn money together.
 

 
When Wei Zekai was taking her home, he casually emphasized, “You must wear the award while wearing the gift I gave you. Otherwise, it won’t do for others to have it and you not. You’re now the representative of our little circle, the face of it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao finally recalled some memories.
 

 
She had been too young and narrow-minded back then. Even though friends had tried to help her when she was self-pitying, she hadn’t seized the opportunity. After experiencing countless worlds in fast-wear scenarios, she could now rise on her own without others' help.
 

 
But…
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
“Thank you? Saying thanks makes it seem distant between good brothers.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, the spokesperson for brotherhood like Liu, Guan, and Zhang, laughed heartily.
 

 
※
 

 
Xu Zhu and Ning Zhiyi, the troubled couple, were furious.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi lay in the medical room for a while, his legs still feeling weak. The pampered young master was terrified he might be disabled for life and urgently called his private doctor. The doctor arrived a bit late, but by the time he showed up, the residual spiritual energy on Ning Zhiyi’s knees had dissipated, and he could stand up.
 

 
Xu Zhu had never seen her refined and elegant brother in such a disheveled state.
 

 
They placed the blame squarely on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Thinking about this, Xu Zhu felt a bit better, as she had always feared that Ning Zhiyi might be taken away by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Now that she had witnessed Tong Zhao’s true nature, it was time to wake up!
 

 
Xu Zhu pleaded softly, “Brother Zhiyi, don’t blame me; she might be so cold to you because she cares about Young Master Wei.”
 

 
In reality, Xu Zhu thought Tong Zhao was simply venting her jealousy.
 

 
Tong Zhao definitely disliked her and was cold to Ning Zhiyi because of it.
 

 
This was something Ning Zhiyi shouldn’t have figured out.
 

 
Sure enough, hearing Wei’s surname made Ning Zhiyi’s expression even darker.
 

 
However, despite moving in the direction she wanted, Xu Zhu felt unexpectedly unhappy. She realized that the ambiguous object of her desire was still thinking about her more attractive stepsister. Her heart felt tightly clenched, and her meticulously made-up face showed a fierce frustration.
 

 
Why does she have to play the role of the Empress so well?
 

 
Why does Tong Zhao get everything she wants?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt unbalanced.
 

 
She became even more determined to trip Tong Zhao up. After Ning Zhiyi dropped her off at home, she immediately used her connections—provided by her father—to send the script for *Countdown 72 Hours* to Tong Zhao. She even forced herself to praise her stepsister in front of the director, convincing him that Tong Zhao was just that good and suitable.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* is a live-streamed show, so if the performance is particularly poor, there will be an audience who will pay just to watch the train wreck and have a laugh, minimizing the loss for the production team.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn’t want to offend anyone; she just wanted Tong Zhao’s reputation to be ruined.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was comfortably soaking in a bath.
 

 
Her manager, Chu Jie, was attentive to her needs. After receiving the invitation for the leading female role, she quickly got in touch to discuss it: “I’m not sure why they invited you. Let me put it this way: I remember you don’t like cilantro, right? Well, the script they sent us is like a pie filled with cilantro—extremely fragrant, but not suitable for you.”
 

 
“What’s the content? Is it really that bad?”
 

 
Tong Zhao found the analogy quite harsh.
 

 
"’ Countdown 72 Hours’ is a live-streamed apocalypse reality show. The role they offered you is that of Feng Yanqi, a decisive and individualistic heroine, which means action scenes are inevitable. And since it’s a live format, even if you’re cast as the lead, if your performance falls short compared to other characters, you might end up overshadowed, making it a risky endeavor.”
 

 
Chu Jie’s analysis was thorough: “It’s better to stick to the style of the Empress and take on similar roles that help build a stable fan base. In the future, people will think of you first for roles with that kind of positioning.”
 

 
This is the mainstream thinking for actors in the era of instinctual films.
 

 
Empress: “Oh, those who fight and kill just don’t fit in.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Indeed, if you took the role, it would be the people fighting over you rather than vaccines in the apocalypse.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Lu Xianzhang or Duan Ge would fit the role better.”
 

 
Duan Ge happens to be a persona that grew from Tong Zhao’s time in the apocalypse side story, similar to Lu Xianzhang in being taciturn.
 

 
“Lu doesn’t work,” the Empress insisted, “Sci-fi would turn into fantasy. Let’s go with Xiao Ge.”
 

 
While Lu Xianzhang disliked men, he also disdained relying on them. Although he had helped many lonely women on their cultivation journey, he mostly did so coldly and with a “give a fish, not a fishing rod” attitude, which strained his relationship with the Empress.
 

 
However, Duan Ge had a nurturing, caring attitude towards women and was well-liked by the Empress.
 

 
After drying herself off, Tong Zhao applied body lotion to her arms and thighs. "It's perfect. The role of Feng Yanqi seems like it was made just for me."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"………???"
 

 
Her manager began to question whether her ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
At that moment, as Tong Zhao was filling the bathtub, the sound of the water in her manager's ears sounded just like the water getting into their artist's head.
# Chapter13
The agent tried to persuade Tong Zhao for a while but couldn’t change her mind.
 

 
Coincidentally, the assistant director from the crew of *Countdown 72 Hours*, who was a friend of hers, was contacted to find out why the invitation was extended to Tong Zhao. The assistant director explained straightforwardly that the team felt Tong Zhao was particularly suited for the role, especially since Xu Zhu, who plays the younger sister in the female lead's role, strongly recommended her!
 

 
Well, it seemed like the whole world had lost its mind.
 

 
Sister Chu felt like she was the only sane person in the world, surrounded by confusion.
 

 
Sister Chu had no choice but to call Tong Zhao again: “It’s strange, the assistant director from *Countdown 72 Hours* said they thought you were perfect for the role, and it seems that Xu Zhu, who plays the second female lead, strongly recommended you. Do you know her?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Yes, I know her. We have a grudge.”
 

 
“Oh, a grudge? No wonder… huh????”
 

 
As Sister Chu was surprised, Tong Zhao had already figured it out—
 

 
Xu Zhu was plotting something.
 

 
A good lead role opportunity is something a newcomer would dream of. Moreover, Feng Yanqi’s character is outstanding, and if performed well, it could overshadow everyone else. Xu Zhu personally endorsing it likely means she wants to use this opportunity to undermine Tong Zhao.
 

 
But can Tong Zhao really perform well?
 

 
Xu Zhu doesn’t think so.
 

 
On the other end, the agent’s displeasure was evident: “It’s a good thing I asked; otherwise, we would have stepped into a pitfall. I’ll decline the invitation now. We won’t work with Xu Zhu or any of her associated projects in the future.” Sister Chu didn’t delve into the details of their grudge, as such situations are too common in the entertainment industry. She always respects the artists' wishes, and being forced into roles is the worst thing.
 

 
“There’s no need to decline. I’m taking this role.”
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s understanding of Xu Zhu, she isn’t someone who would rely on underhanded tactics.
 

 
Using such a direct approach means her options for covert actions are limited.
 

 
That’s a good thing.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the bed, applying transparent nail polish while discussing the details with her agent over the phone.
 

 
Consort Chen was displeased: "Red isn't pretty at all. It's like not wearing any at all."
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think it looks quite good."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Who’s playing the role this time? Is it the Lu surname or Xiao Ge?"
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Tong Zhao finally had time to join the meeting: "Originally, Lu Xianchang would have been fine, but now that I know it's my cheap stepsister playing the lead role’s younger sister... It can only be Duan Ge."
 

 
A female reporter commented wryly: "If Old Lu were in the role, Xu Zhu wouldn't last five minutes. She definitely wouldn’t be able to handle the protective sister scenes."
 

 
Lu Xianchang had no way to refute this.
 

 
She hated being betrayed by acquaintances the most and probably couldn’t stand Xu Zhu bouncing around in front of her for even a second in the indulgent movie. The drama would be too severe, though the entertainment value would be high...
 

 
"Duan Ge, is that alright?"
 

 
From the depths of her subconscious, a gentle, slightly hoarse voice surfaced:
 

 
"Of course, I’m very willing to serve Zhao Zhao.”
 

 
Duan Ge.
 

 
Her voice had become slightly fragmented due to a mild infection from the zombie virus.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mission in the post-apocalyptic scenario was not to pursue anyone but to save three key characters. She also managed to establish a settlement in the apocalypse and, as a side note, caused the heroine who was supposed to be happily paired with the male lead to fall for her instead... but that's another story. In any case, among her many derived personalities, this one had the strongest protective instinct toward women.
 

 
"Alright, thank you."
 

 
In the dead of night, only her sea of consciousness was lively.
 

 
Tong Zhao hugged her knees and let the nail polish on her hands dry, as if embracing herself.

@Countdown72HoursV:
 

 
The last piece of the fugitive team puzzle has been found [heart][heart]
 

 
[Give me three minutes. I need to know the details of this actor in three minutes.]
 

 
[How can you discuss things if you don’t finish talking, big brother? Don't you want the water that’s coming to you?]
 

 
[“It’s rare to find an actor who can portray Feng Yanqi well! Lin Shu and Chen Yijie are both quite capable, but weren't their schedules mismatched?”]
 

 
[Look, the official account just followed a new actress!]
 

 
One word wakes people from their dreams. The name in the latest follow on the official account dazzled netizens—
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV
 

 
Is it actually her?
 

 
Since she had just debuted, many people didn’t even remember her name, only her face. As soon as they saw that delicate face, they knew it was the Consort. She had a high approval rating from the public.
 

 
High approval rating aside, the image of Consort Chen and the character Feng Yanqi just doesn’t match!
 

 
In a semi-reality show film like "Countdown 72 Hours," each actor gets a corresponding character template but no specific action instructions, only general guidance.
 

 
In contrast, in "The Chronicle of Emperor Ming," actors know exactly what to do at certain times and places.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," actors have a lot of freedom within a set framework, so some predecessors have delivered particularly impressive performances. For example, in "The Court of Storms," the high degree of freedom allowed for intense rivalries that escalated to the level of six great kingdoms, which is still fondly discussed by drama fans today.
 

 
[Oh, this?]
 

 
[No, you can’t just pick someone based on recent popularity; it’s a recipe for disaster!]
 

 
[You need to think carefully. Feng Yanqi has the heaviest workload in the drama. If the lead actress can’t handle it, the whole group could face a disastrous ending.]
 

 
[Consort’s agent, please be more thoughtful. Don’t just grab at the first opportunity; you need to use your brain.]
 

 
[Agent: Use my brain? What does that mean?]
 

 
……
 

 
Seeing these doubts about the agent’s choices, Chu Jie’s mood deteriorated slightly.
 

 
She had put a lot of thought into it, but the artist has her own ideas.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that this role was tailor-made for her, so what could she do?
 

 
With the Tong family's connections backing her, Chu Jie inexplicably found herself on this fast track, and the production team quickly confirmed Tong Zhao's leading role. The promotion followed swiftly, making everything feel like the joy of "having influential people making things happen." Xu Zhu’s plan to tarnish Tong Zhao’s reputation and make her untouchable was to boost her fame before the shoot began.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," besides the lead character, there are also two other female roles.
 

 
If Tong Zhao doesn’t perform well, the spotlight will shift to Xu Zhu, so the current promotion is definitely not a waste, but rather a significant gain. Xu Zhu knew Tong Zhao too well. Even if Tong Zhao was indeed quite stubborn, her stubbornness was of the high-born kind.
 

 
Just like a delicate and fragile violin, even if it produces a powerful melody, it’s still not the same thing.
 

 
In Xu Zhu’s eyes, Tong Zhao was still the same as before—unable to handle provocations.
 

 
A little agitation or provocation would make her stubbornly accept a challenge with slim chances of success.
 

 
She simply wouldn't be able to perform well in "Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
...
 

 
The comments on that Weibo post were chaotic, with the majority expressing disapproval of Tong Zhao's casting.
 

 
As a newcomer, Tong Zhao was discussed with a somewhat condescending tone. Most people mocked her for overestimating herself, daring to take on any role, and being overjoyed at landing a leading role without considering if she was capable of handling the type of character.
 

 
[Trying to plant trees in the Empress’s heart, growing some pressure trees.]
 

 
[Not interested in watching anymore. Does anyone want the movie tickets I won from the lottery?]
 

 
[I want them! Why would anyone not want to watch? I’m curious to see how the Empress performs in an apocalyptic survival film. Isn’t the appeal of a live-streamed, instinctual movie in the unpredictable excitement of what might go wrong next?]
 

 
The forums were abuzz with heated discussions.
 

 
The director didn’t hire any trolls, but Xu Zhu did invest a bit to stir things up, adding fuel to the fire. The criticism was incessant.
 

 
"Let’s open the discussion: what kind of plot twists do you expect from this apocalyptic film?"
 

 
"Laughing my head off, wasn’t Sister Tang still hyping up this role a few days ago? The choice of the lead actress is just ridiculous."
 

 
Tang Jingjie, the male lead of "Countdown 72 Hours," was making his debut as the main character. Fans had been excited for days, only to be met with this shocking turn of events—
 

 
From a highly anticipated Valentine's Day release to what looks like a guaranteed flop.
 

 
Which fanbase can tolerate this?
 

 
Sister Tang couldn't take it and had to rush to the production team, privately messaging the director to reconsider.
 

 
The director, an old-school type, felt that today’s star-chasing young girls were naive and preferred to listen to familiar opinions. Since the familiar source was one who had received benefits from Xu Zhu—using Tong Zhao meant the entire promotion was taken care of by capital—it seemed like a good deal. The director shut down his Weibo and stopped paying attention.
 

 
With nowhere else to turn, Sister Tang and her team didn’t give up and desperately sought out a final option.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao opened Weibo and found that both her private messages and comments were flooded.
 

 
They were all pleas for her not to take the role.
# Chapter14
Tong Zhao was added to the production team’s WeChat group.
 

 
It happened suddenly, and someone clueless posted a screenshot of the comments on Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The screenshot was posted after she joined the group.
 

 
The props master, realizing the blunder, quickly retracted the message.
 

 
But as someone with excellent dynamic vision from her training, Tong Zhao had already seen the content. Under Han Zhi’s guidance, she responded: "It’s a good way to create buzz. Anyway, I’ll perform well. We can let the netizens fuss for a couple of days without responding, and we get the heat for free. Curiosity will bring viewers."
 

 
The lead’s nonchalant response embarrassed Tang Jingjie.
 

 
After all, it was his fans who were pleading for her not to act.
 

 
Tang Jingjie: “I’ll go post on Weibo and manage this.”
 

 
His words didn’t have much effect on his fans. Having just debuted, he had mostly been in supporting roles, and his "true self" was too gentle, attracting a group of "mommy fans." In other words, he felt AAA wouldn’t help, while fans thought BBB. No mother lets her son make decisions; they follow their mom’s advice.
 

 
As a result, it made others want to exclaim, "Damn it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need, just wait for the release.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can't back out now; I've signed the contract.]
 

 
It seemed Xu Zhu was afraid Tong Zhao might come to her senses and drop the project, so she urged the production team to finalize the contract quickly to reduce uncertainty. Xu Zhu was also in the WeChat group, and seeing her stepsister’s calm demeanor, a pang of unease surfaced.
 

 
What if she really performs well?
 

 
…
 

 
It's impossible.
 

 
Even if Tong Zhao's subconscious drive is strong, she might at best avoid a complete disaster, but she won’t excel. As netizens have said, there are two more suitable actresses in the industry, but their schedules don’t align. They and the Concubine Shen aren’t of the same type, and Xu Zhu doesn’t see any good qualities for the role of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Having thought this through, Xu Zhu relaxed and continued to feign sympathy in the WeChat group.
 

 
Xu Zhu: [Everyone, keep up the good work! ^^]
 

 
Tong Zhao did not respond.
 

 
Because she turned off her phone and began meditating and cultivating.
 

 
For several days, fans of Tang Jingjie and netizens stirred up trouble without any official response. They only received a set of costume photos, indicating that the production team was adamant about using Tong Zhao. However, there were also rumors in forums that the contract had long been signed, and the list of actors had been submitted to the Instinct Film Association, leaving no room for change.
 

 
@Countdown72Hoursv
 

 
The entire escape team is assembled!
 

 
As the female lead, Tong Zhao was unquestionably placed in the first spot. Since it’s an escape film, she wasn’t given an elaborate makeup, but her looks still outshone the remaining female supporting characters. Her beautifully shaped eyes coldly stared at the camera...
 

 
The face was still the same, but there was a subtle difference from when she played the Concubine.
 

 
That difference made her seem like a different person.
 

 
Being gazed at by the Concubine felt like being subtly teased by an invisible force.
 

 
In this costume photo, Tong Zhao’s glance at anyone felt like an electric shock—painful and deeply unsettling, yet unrelated to romantic matters.
 

 
People are visual creatures, and the moment they saw this costume photo, their confidence that Tong Zhao was unsuitable for *Countdown 72 Hours* wavered.
 

 
However, the trending comments helped them reaffirm their stance.
 

 
[If it were a traditional film, I'd be more at ease / dog head]
 

 
[Makeup can change a person's demeanor, but it can't change the "true self" in a short time.]
 

 
[If I hadn't seen Tong Zhao play the Concubine, I'd be looking forward to this film, but now...]
 

 
[And the difference in appearance between the sisters in the film is so big, it doesn’t look like they are sisters.]
 

 
This perfectly captured the sense of incongruity.
 

 
If there’s any flaw in Tong Zhao’s costume photo, it’s that she’s too beautiful.
 

 
The light makeup actually accentuates the sharp contours of her features even more. Beauty cannot be hidden or covered up.
 

 
Alright, the window of opportunity has been shattered. As soon as the costume photo was released, Xu Zhu's freshly enthusiastic fanbase exploded. The post quickly turned into a battleground between fans and haters—despite both groups being relatively small at this stage, the constant bickering caused the comments and shares to surge exponentially, achieving the level of heated discussion the production team wanted.
 

 
The day of the shoot arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
Since this was Tong Zhao’s first time participating in a live-stream format film, her manager, Chu Jie, drove her to the location while explaining the key points to pay attention to.
 

 
There is a roughly five-minute delay between the shooting and the viewing to allow the AI to automatically skip parts that cannot be broadcast, such as wardrobe malfunctions during battles. Before the film ends, the actors remain connected to the cabin, and the AI filters out unnecessary time.
 

 
For instance, when sleeping.
 

 
In the film, if an actor finds a safe place to rest beforehand, and the AI scans the area for any threats, it will skip over this part of the time, making sleep seem instantaneous. However, if an actor carelessly sleeps in a location with potential threats, random events may be triggered.
 

 
"Live shooting is the most different from traditional films; it’s more like a reality show format."
 

 
Chu Jie concluded, and Tong Zhao nodded in agreement.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "The fact that this type of thing can be popular just shows that people still have too much free time."
 

 
As she spoke, the two arrived at the venue.
 

 
When Tong Zhao walked into the shooting area, the conversation momentarily ceased, and countless eyes turned toward her, focusing intently on Tong Zhao while her manager was overlooked.
 

 
Chu Jie wasn’t annoyed; in fact, she was pleased. This was a good sign.
 

 
A promising star naturally commands attention and draws others' gazes.
 

 
Since it was a major event, Tong Zhao confidently embraced the aura of being the center of attention. Her already outstanding presence became almost dreamlike. While the female attendees could resist, the male attendees were dazzled and their hearts raced.
 

 
Aside from the director and core members who had been brainwashed by the Tong family and Xu Zhu, most of the gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism.
 

 
She is indeed beautiful.
 

 
But why should she be able to play Feng Yanqi?
 

 
This is the least beauty-focused female role of the year.
 

 
Seeing everyone's attention fully focused on her stepsister, Xu Zhu's expression fell. She felt uncomfortable, with loathing and hatred filling her chest. But then she remembered that no matter how beautiful Tong Zhao was, she was still not suitable for this role, which made her feel a bit better.
 

 
Xu Zhu's tone held a hint of disdain: "Isn't she just craving attention?"
 

 
"She is the female lead."
 

 
Unfortunately, the third female role was a straightforward girl who didn't catch onto Xu Zhu's shared animosity.
 

 
Shortly after Tong Zhao's appearance, Tang Jingjie hurried over to apologize for the issues caused by fans. Tong Zhao saw his sincere attitude, his weak demeanor, and his puppy-dog look that inspired maternal affection, so she didn't bother to argue and accepted his apology.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This kid is clearly being tightly controlled by his manager.]
 

 
Empress Chen agreed: "Not bad, has potential, might survive for three days."
 

 
Han Zhi: "He is the male lead; theoretically, he should last until the end."
 

 
Empress Chen: "What I mean is, that Xiao Ge prefers soft approaches over hard ones. He’ll do well working under her if he’s this obedient."
 

 
Despite being inexplicably labeled as the head of the family, Duan Ge didn’t refute this.
 

 
Not hearing her voice, Tong Zhao only sensed that she was smiling.
 

 
The gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism, contemplation, or curiosity, but she lay down in the shooting chamber as if she didn’t notice, showing no signs of a shaken mindset.
 

 
"Please ensure all actors have their connection devices properly fitted. The instinctive filming will begin in one minute."
 

 
Unlike ordinary people, Tong Zhao’s mind felt like a shared rental apartment.
 

 
A female reporter commented: "Duan Ge is great at everything except that he talks too much while taking action. If it weren’t for the need to protect someone, it would have been better if Lu Xianchang had come instead.”
 

 
When the device came to take away her "true self," the other personalities tacitly closed the door, leaving Duan Ge in the living room to welcome guests. Overcome by a strong drowsiness, she fell into a deep sleep, as if sinking into a warm, profound ocean...

[That day was the day the conspiracy was set in motion.
 

 
The virus spread through the groundwater. People, unaware of the danger, continued to drink as usual. The mutated undead and the virus spread throughout the city, causing countless deaths in despair. What’s even more perplexing is that the mastermind behind it had no demands—he didn't seek to revolt, seize power, or gain money. He simply wanted—
 

 
All skyscrapers, TV screens, and even fallen mobile phone screens reflected a young, pale face, facing the camera and recounting his achievements: “By the time you see this video, the infection rate will have reached 99%. I intend to personally end this stupid and tedious world, but…”]
 

 
"At any time, I will always leave a window open for the smart ones," the doctor smiled. "The antidote is at the top of the Tower of Wisdom. If you haven’t directly consumed contaminated water, well... you have about three days? You can come and find your Noah’s Ark, but after I die, the tower will automatically enter a defensive state..."
 

 
Thinking about the survivors who narrowly escaped the first wave of the virus, crying in despair outside the tower and slowly dying from the virus’s torment, the doctor’s smile grew more sincere, and his eyes gradually lost focus.
 

 
Feng Yanjie and his group were stranded in a mountain cabin during a weekend outing due to a heavy rainstorm, narrowly avoiding the first wave of the virus spread and becoming some of the few sober people left in K City. Upon returning to the city center and learning about the events and causes, they realized that even a simple escape was impossible!
 

 
The first wave of the virus spread through water. After the storm, the sunny weather filled the air with diluted second-wave toxins.
 

 
In 72 hours, they would be completely assimilated into the undead.
 

 
To survive, they must go to the research institute and find the antidote.
 

 
Since this is a live-action film, the plot background cannot be too complicated to avoid losing control, so the main quest for the protagonist group is clear: survive in the zombie-infested K City and head to the research institute to obtain the antidote. Completing this mission will mean passing the game.
 

 
The main antagonist, the doctor, couldn’t find an actor to achieve a similar effect, so the film was shot using traditional methods, with data directly loaded by a template specialist. This was a clever workaround by the production team.
 

 
When the protagonist’s "true self" woke up in the film, it coincided with Tang Jingjie driving into the city. The car reconnected to the network and started playing the doctor’s speech. Initially thought to be a prank, the seriousness of the situation became apparent when they couldn’t find any employees at the gas station, and upon seeing the first zombie, they realized the gravity of the situation.
 

 
The women in the car were horrified, while only Tang Jingjie was at a convenience store some distance from the car.
 

 
[High-energy opening, bullet screens for protection]
 

 
[Ahhh, Jie, run!]
 

 
[Mommy’s heart aches, seeing how scared the child is…]
 

 
As the zombie lunged ferociously at Tang Jingjie, fans watching the holographic film also felt the rush of danger!
 

 
In an instant, a heavy thud sounded as the zombie fell.
 

 
Seeing the zombie, Tong Zhao had already gotten out of the car, holding a wrench.
 

 
The wrench was stained with dark blood, clearly the tool used to crush the zombies’ heads.
 

 
She raised an eyebrow at the male lead:
 

 
“As a physical education teacher, it’s quite reasonable for me to carry a wrench, don’t you think?”
# Chapter15
[...]
 

 
"......"
 

 
At this moment, both inside and outside the scene, the reactions of the characters and the audience were in sync.
 

 
Tong Zhao nudged the zombie lying on the ground with the tip of her shoe. After confirming that it had indeed met its end, she crouched down and reached for its waist...
 

 
"Yan Qi, what are you doing?"
 

 
Tang Jingjie, horrified by her actions, covered his mouth, trying to suppress both his urge to stop her and his urge to vomit.
 

 
The audience was also curious about what she was doing.
 

 
Even though Concubine Chen liked men, there was no way she'd go after a zombie!
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out a set of keys from the zombie's pocket. "I just noticed that the fuel dispenser over there is locked and needs a key to open it. There might also be supplies we need in the convenience store. It's always a good idea to grab the keys first."
 

 
"Oh, you really think things through."
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao headed towards the convenience store.
 

 
Tang Jingjie's legs were still weak, so he could only stand in place, awkwardly locking eyes with the zombie.
 

 
Even though this was a horror movie, this scene inexplicably had a comedic vibe.
 

 
In the car, Feng Sisi carefully got out after confirming there was no danger. She tiptoed over to Tang Jingjie and tugged at his sleeve, "Kaiyu-ge, are you okay?"
 

 
According to the plot, Song Kaiyu and Feng Yanqi were a couple.
 

 
One taught language arts, the other taught physical education.
 

 
"Countdown: 72 Hours" is a story about a couple escaping with their pampered little sister.
 

 
Due to needing to pass censorship, the setting was an imaginary foreign country, which was a bit different from the domestic environment.
 

 
[...Wait, how could the male lead be in trouble? As soon as the zombie appeared, it got its head blown off by the female lead.]
 

 
[Zombie: I'm the one who's in trouble here.]
 

 
[True, the zombie's fate is tragic. Feeling sorry for it.]
 

 
[Feeling sorry +1]
 

 
The screen was filled with sympathetic comments.
 

 
"I'm fine; Yanqi protected me."
 

 
Song Kaiyu glanced toward the convenience store, just as Tong Zhao came back carrying bags full of stuff. Her beautiful, ethereal face was calm as if she had just come back from a pleasant shopping spree at a designer store rather than having just blown a zombie's head off. Meeting their gazes, she raised an eyebrow and said, "I did leave some money behind."
 

 
If a real zombie apocalypse broke out, cash would become nothing more than waste paper.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao's reasonable action somewhat reassured the two.
 

 
The director then cuts to a shot inside the convenience store.
 

 
Sure enough, a few bills were pressed down on the cashier counter.
 

 
Tong Zhao stuffed the supplies she bought into the car, filling it to the brim. After filling up the gas tank, she also took two large barrels of extra fuel. Once everything was done, she looked back at the two who were still standing dumbfounded next to the zombie. "What’s wrong? Is this your first time seeing a zombie? Are you too reluctant to leave it? Do you want to take a picture with it before we go?"
 

 
[...Hahaha, a photo with the zombie, really?!]
 

 
[I took a screenshot. Mom will make sure Jiezai gets his dream photo!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is unbelievably cool. Her "id" is truly formidable. Thank goodness Emperor Ming dotes on her; otherwise, I suspect she'd be blowing other people's heads off in the harem.]
 

 
[The Noble Consort herself administering justice!]
 

 
These words snapped the two iron-headed fools out of their daze, and they hurriedly got back in the car.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the front passenger seat. She rolled down the window to let in some fresh air and pulled out a pack of soft Zhonghua cigarettes. She flicked the lighter in her hand, turning the act of lighting a cigarette into a display akin to playing with a small knife. With a crisp click, the cigarette lit up. She took a deep drag, finally feeling like her soul had settled back into place.
 

 
Among her many personalities, only a few were addicted to smoking—Duan Ge was one of them.
 

 
After all, the mental stress of surviving the apocalypse was overwhelming.
 

 
As Song Kaiyu's car drove into a tunnel, the surroundings darkened, leaving only the flickering flame between Tong Zhao's fingers. The light and shadow pulled her pale face into an oil-painting-like beauty, so stunning that the audience held their breath, once again reminded of how impossibly gorgeous this talented newcomer was.
 

 
However...
 

 
[Someone, give the boss a Huazi cigarette. .jpg]
 

 
[The boss smokes Zhonghua. .gif]
 

 
[Damn it, it's the member-exclusive privilege of posting animated gifs that won!]
 

 
This scene was truly stunning, prompting a popular influencer with over a million followers to casually share a Weibo post showcasing this breathtaking beauty.
 

 
@DramaLovingBoboRabbitv:
 

 
Give Brother Tong Zhao a Huazi cigarette /dog head emoji
 

 
[GIF]
 

 
Beauty is a universal currency, and with the production team riding the wave and buying some bot traffic, this GIF managed to latch onto the tail end of the trending list, stirring up some minor buzz and attracting more netizens to pay for the live viewing privileges.
 

 
Back to the car interior.
 

 
Sitting in the back seat, Feng Sisi looked deeply worried. Song Kaiyu, who was driving, also had a pale face after seeing the tragic scenes along the way. Only Tong Zhao, after finishing her cigarette, kept gazing out the window, lost in thought. The streets were eerily quiet, with scattered remains of bodies that had been devoured, and the smell of blood lingering in the air. With Tong Zhao's consent, Song Kaiyu closed all the windows.
 

 
"If I smell that stench any longer, I’m going to throw up," Song Kaiyu said with a wry smile.
 

 
The three of them headed back together, only to find that the residential apartment complex had already become a playground for rampaging zombies.
 

 
Tong Zhao quietly observed outside the apartment for a while and then made her judgment: "If water is the primary source of contamination, then Dad and Mom wouldn't have escaped the first wave. With our current combat ability, barging in would only add three more casualties. The priority now is to find the antidote that person mentioned. If Mom and Dad are still alive, as long as they stay indoors, the food at home should last for three days."
 

 
From the omniscient perspective, the audience felt that Tong Zhao made a lot of sense.
 

 
[Seems like the director wasn't wrong—Tong Zhao is quite clever.]
 

 
[The one who laughs last in palace intrigues can't possibly be a fool. The emperor is scarier than zombies, after all.]
 

 
[This is so strange. Tong Zhao's 'id' doesn't seem to plan on relying on the male lead at all. Oh, and isn't Tang Jingjie kind of just playing a background role here...]
 

 
While Sister Tang was anxiously explaining, another person also grew agitated.
 

 
Feng Sisi's eyes were red like a rabbit's, filled with tears as she shook her head, "I won't feel at ease if I can't see Mom. Sis, can't you just try? How can you say Mom is gone without even trying? How can you leave her behind?"
 

 
Xu Zhu grew up relying on her mother since she was little, and subconsciously, she cared about her mother the most.
 

 
Tong Zhao cared too.
 

 
At any given time, Duan Ge would always make the most rational decision that maximizes benefits, ensuring the survival group could go further. Even now, as she fits into the character template, she is no exception. She said, "We will come back to check on Mom's safety once we find the antidote. If she managed to avoid the first wave of the virus, she will probably need the antidote just like us."
 

 
These clear and logical words naturally calmed the viewers' minds.
 

 
From a god's-eye view, the audience is often quite demanding of the characters.
 

 
They want to see them stay composed in crises and make the right decisions with limited information.
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at Tong Zhao in disbelief but didn't refute her. She asked quietly, "Should we leave now?"
 

 
"Yes."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded her chin toward Song Kaiyu, "First, we need to find the location of the research lab, then head to the nearest gun store."
 

 
Hearing "gun store," Feng Sisi flinched a little.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't question her decision; he just asked while driving, "Yanqi, do you have a gun license? How come I didn't know?”
 

 
"I don't have one. Once we get some, I'll practice my aim. As long as I don't shoot at living people, it should be fine," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
While the internet was still working, Song Kaiyu downloaded a map of the entire city and drove to the nearest gun store. The store's door was wide open, and it was eerily silent. Feng Sisi refused to get out of the car no matter what. Tong Zhao didn't force her, nor did she ask Song Kaiyu to join her, as if she intended to act alone.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated for a moment but decided to follow her.
 

 
"If anything happens, call us on the phone," he reminded Feng Sisi, who was staying in the car.
 

 
"Can't someone stay with me?" she asked, feeling a bit abandoned.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
It was already dangerous enough for Tong Zhao to go alone. Just as Song Kaiyu was about to refuse, Tong Zhao spoke first:
 

 
"Sure, whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao had her hands in her pockets, looking indifferent.
 

 
With that, she turned around and walked into the gun store. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth, showing a look of suppressed fear, and followed her inside.
 

 
Rows of guns covered an entire wall. The two moved quietly, one in front of the other, but Song Kaiyu noticed that no matter how careful he was, he couldn't move as silently as Tong Zhao.
 

 
After making a round in the store and confirming there were no living people or zombies, they relaxed and began to search for usable weapons. Tong Zhao advised, "Don't get too greedy; you can't chew what you can't swallow. Ever played PUBG? Pick something simple and easy to use... And put down that sniper rifle. I don't want to see you using a sniper to go face-to-face with zombies."
 

 
Song Kaiyu awkwardly put down the sniper rifle he had taken a liking to.
 

 
Tong Zhao was feeling a SCAR rifle, her expression thoughtful. "I don't know why, but when I touch these guns, they feel strangely familiar. I feel like I could use them right away."
 

 
Song Kaiyu asked, "Huh? Why?"
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Maybe it's because I'm a gym teacher."
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't quite get the logic behind that, but he took advantage of the lighter mood to quickly thank his girlfriend. "Thanks for saving me back at the gas station. Otherwise, I’d probably be dead by now."
 

 
"No need to thank me; just don’t take up my PE class time anymore."
 

 
"..."
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
As Tong Zhao was loading bullets, a door was gently pushed open. Song Kaiyu, alert, aimed his gun toward the source of the sound.
 

 
In the dimly lit gun shop, his sharp silhouette made the barrage of comments explode with excitement—finally, the male lead from all those PUBG fanfics had a face.
 

 
But his coolness lasted less than three seconds. The gun in his hand sank as Tong Zhao grabbed the barrel, pushing it downward. "You haven’t loaded any bullets yet; no need to aim. That's a living person. Are you the shopkeeper? The door was locked just now. We mean no harm. Can we talk?"
 

 
Out of the storage room came a small round face wearing glasses.
 

 
The three of them kept a safe distance from each other as they began their negotiation—
 

 
Well, it was less a negotiation and more of Tong Zhao's one-sided questioning.
 

 
The round-faced girl introduced herself as Anna. She claimed to be a janitor who had escaped from the research institute. While slacking off at work, she overheard information about the dangers of drug research and decided to run away. Because she usually drank only bottled water and had boxes of Evian stockpiled at home, she assumed she would be safe as long as she hadn’t touched tap water. However, after seeing a video posted by the doctor, she panicked and hid in her cousin’s shop.
 

 
She had been hiding in the storage room earlier and only dared to come out when she saw another young woman was traveling with the man.
 

 
“The city is already in chaos. Zombies are dangerous, and living people aren’t safe either,” Anna said. “You want to go find the antidote? That's impossible. The research institute has a fully enclosed security system and laser corridors. Anyway, the doctor was right. We won't get far even if we try to escape…”
 

 
Saying this, Anna began to sob softly.
 

 
“Since you worked at the research institute, you should be very familiar with its layout. You’ll guide us when the time comes,” Tong Zhao said, naturally patting her head. “I’ll handle everything.”
 

 
“Miss Feng…”
 

 
Anna looked at the slender and tall Oriental woman with gratitude.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “At worst, we’ll die.”
 

 
Her words extinguished the sentiment like a gust of wind scattering ashes.
# Chapter16
Tong Zhao gained Anna's trust with just a few words.
 

 
Firstly, women who are often seen as sexual resources in extreme environments tend to trust other women more.
 

 
Secondly, it was Tong Zhao's body language.
 

 
She exuded a calm confidence, whether she was scavenging for weapons or interrogating Anna. The other Oriental man also seemed to follow her instructions readily. Anna had no hesitation in positioning herself as a subordinate, and after being patted on the head, her sense of security skyrocketed.
 

 
At the same time, Feng Sisi wasn’t as fortunate.
 

 
A zombie had stumbled over, seemingly noticing the commotion inside the vehicle. The wobbly zombie pressed its half-decayed face against the car window, rubbing it inquisitively. Feng Sisi was terrified, her hands trembling as she held her phone, unable to stabilize her attempt to call her sister for help. Her panicked noise only drew the zombie’s attention further, causing it to bang more aggressively on the window.
 

 
Just as Feng Sisi was on the verge of losing control, the zombie pressing against the window suddenly jerked backward.
 

 
Upon closer inspection—
 

 
It turned out that Tong Zhao had grabbed the zombie by the hair, slammed it to the ground, and then used a crowbar to smash its head.
 

 
[Victimized Zombie +1]
 

 
[Damn, the Empress's fight scenes are so cool! I want to see her in physical palace battles!]
 

 
[So Tong Zhao also knows the wonders of physical combat! Overjoyed and dancing >////<]
 

 
Audience members who watch apocalyptic survival movies generally seek visual thrills and exploration of human nature and strategic thinking in extreme environments, and Tong Zhao delivers on this visual spectacle. She is like a beautiful and graceful berserker, with every move displaying an aesthetic of precision and efficiency. Her actions, though not choreographed, feel more genuine and thrilling!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao, Feng Sisi, with red eyes, cried out:
 

 
"Why did you only just arrive? I almost died!"
 

 
Before exposing the truth and tearing her face, Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao attended middle and high school together. If anyone bullied her, as long as she sought Tong Zhao’s help, she would always rescue her from dire straits. Even the ungrateful Tong Father once remarked that the bond between them, mother and daughter, was exceptionally loyal and caring toward friends.
 

 
In contrast, after experiencing multiple worlds in quick succession and going through several reincarnations, Tong Zhao’s perspective is different. From Xu Zhu's point of view, they had only fallen out less than a year ago. Before that, whenever she sought Tong Zhao’s help, it was always with the expectation of being rescued.
 

 
Thus, the audience witnessed her authoritative demeanor in action.
 

 
“The zombies' strength is only slightly greater than that of ordinary people, but a barehanded one can't break a car window. You weren't in immediate danger, and I didn't receive your call for help; I was just handling some business. This staff member who escaped from the research institute can provide us with information on the routes inside.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s expression was indifferent as if she were dealing with a younger sister’s unreasonable tantrum.
 

 
The person involved, Anna, cowered behind Tong Zhao and weakly raised her hand: “Sorry, it’s my fault for delaying things…”
 

 
“You didn’t do anything wrong. No need to apologize.”
 

 
Tong Zhao cut off her apology, her tone still cold.
 

 
Feng Sisi, already on edge, was even more upset. She glanced at Anna and then stared in disbelief at Tong Zhao. Seeing that Tong Zhao had no intention of comforting her, she shouted, “Yes, she’s not at fault. It’s my fault for not getting killed by the zombies just now!” After yelling, she turned her head away and refused to engage.
 

 
After getting back in the car, Anna, unable to contain her curiosity, asked quietly, “Miss Feng, you were so cool when you took down the zombies earlier. Is that what Chinese martial arts look like? Are you a master at a martial arts school?”
 

 
……
 

 
[Indeed, the foreigner's “true self” is very on point.]
 

 
[No, no, no, not every Chinese person is as skilled as the empress. She’s just a master of palace intrigue.]
 

 
[Which school of palace intrigue is this? You, Empress Liyang from Yanxi Palace; me, Ip Man of Wing Chun.]
 

 
Tong Zhao waved her hand: “No, I’m just an ordinary physical education teacher.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu recalled something: “But it seems like you’ve been teaching Tai Chi recently?”
 

 
[No, shut up, Kaiyu. The misunderstanding with the foreign friend is really hard to clear up!]
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a cold look: “Yes, but my class time was taken up by too many other things. Since the school year started, I've only taught up to ‘White Crane Spreads Its Wings.’”
 

 
Hearing the familiar pronunciation of “Tai Chi” from kung fu movies, Anna's eyes lit up, increasingly convinced that Tong Zhao was a hidden expert in Chinese martial arts. She leaned in secretly and asked softly if she was a student of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment: “If I had to say, my style is more like Chen Haonan’s.”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Two traditional film actors suffer from reputation damage!]
 

 
[All I can say is, you’re both brave enough to ask and answer.]
 

 
The audience was laughing uncontrollably, not expecting an apocalypse movie to have such humor, and even more surprised that Tong Zhao’s subconscious could be such a deadpan comedian—
 

 
Her comedic effect in *The Emperor Ming's Story* was not this good!
 

 
It was strange.
 

 
How had she become so witty and sharp-tongued in such a short time?
 

 
The segment titled "The Confusing Exchange Between Chinese and Foreign Friends' True Selves" was cut out by the overjoyed publicity team and prepared for promotion by several paid marketing accounts. They didn’t expect that collaborating with Tong Zhao would be so enjoyable, with promotional material practically handed to them, leaving them with no worries.
 

 
Compared to the unreasonable and troublesome second female lead, Feng Sisi, the audience surprisingly liked the blonde, round-faced Anna more and looked forward to seeing her interactions with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Outside the show, the director sighed: “Xu Zhu didn’t grasp the cute aspects of her character, but Anna’s natural performance was very charming.”
 

 
“It was an accidental bonus. Anna was originally just a supporting role,” said the screenwriter.
 

 
To ensure the plot stayed on track and smoothly reached its conclusion, the screenwriter avoided creating impossible situations.
 

 
Anna, who escaped from the research institute, served as a tool to provide information on the institute’s layout, greatly reducing the difficulty of the high-risk strategy. Otherwise, with an average person’s capabilities, it would be extremely difficult to tackle the stringent and dangerous security systems of the research institute.
 

 
While chatting, a change occurred within the scene.
 

 
On the way to the research institute, they passed by a public restroom. Feng Sisi, who had been trying to maintain her aloof demeanor, couldn't hold it anymore and repeatedly said she needed to use the restroom: “Sister, you have to come with me this time.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her.
 

 
Anna timidly raised her hand: “Sorry, I also need to go…”
 

 
“Let’s go together.”
 

 
Tong Zhao got out of the car, intending to check it out first. The two girls, who had been holding it in under high pressure, rushed in as if granted amnesty. They had been holding it in for so long that as soon as they saw the restroom, they couldn’t hold it any longer.
 

 
Typically, at such times, smart AI would only provide a distant shot of the public restroom and footage of hand-washing. However, this time the camera followed them in and experienced viewers immediately sensed an imminent crisis.
 

 
Sure enough, when Feng Sisi pushed open the door to the last stall, a zombie that had been roused by the noise turned around and lunged at her—
 

 
Feng Sisi screamed, but her first reaction wasn’t to step back or dodge.
 

 
Instinctively, she pulled Anna, who was about to enter the adjacent stall, in front of herself!
 

 
“Sister, help me, sister!”
 

 
“Ah—”
 

 
The blonde, round-faced Anna was thrown into the zombie’s mouth, screaming in pain as a large wound was gnawed into her delicate white neck.
 

 
……
 

 
[What is this?]
 

 
[Feng Sisi is crazy! How could she be so selfish? She’s lost her mind!]
 

 
[Is there still a chance? Without Anna, how will we get into the research institute to find the antidote?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the filming set.
 

 
Director: “Props team, who put that zombie there for the door-kill scene!?”
 

 
The props team, feeling aggrieved, explained: “I lowered the zombie’s movement speed data. She just needed to dodge it. Who would have thought she’d pull Anna in front of it? Should I air-drop a map of the research institute now?”
 

 
“I want to air-drop you right now!”
 

 
The director was furious.
 

 
The situation was serious.
 

 
With the key supporting character dead, how would the main characters get into the research institute?
# Chapter17
At the moment the scream rang out, Tong Zhao charged in.
 

 
She moved swiftly, delivering a precise high kick that sent the zombie crashing against the wall. Then, using a crowbar, she smashed the zombie's head to bits, ensuring it could no longer pose any threat. Only then did she turn to embrace the falling Anna. Blood gushed from Anna’s neck wound, which had been bitten, and she tried to speak, but her shattered throat could only produce incoherent sounds.
 

 
Feng Sisi, originally worried that she might be exposed, felt a vague sense of relief upon seeing this scene.
 

 
"Sis, I-I didn’t expect there to be a zombie inside, and Anna was attacked..."
 

 
Feng Sisi, feeling both guilty and frightened, weakly showed her fear to her sister, her mind still reeling.
 

 
They were real sisters, after all; her sister surely wouldn’t turn against her over someone she had only recently met!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't respond but simply stared fixedly at Feng Sisi.
 

 
The director used the eye-tracking system to switch the camera angles, allowing the audience to see where Tong Zhao's gaze was focused at that moment:
 

 
First on Feng Sisi's eyes, then on the location where the zombie had fallen, and finally on Anna's expression, which was beginning to freeze.
 

 
Through this sequence of camera shots, most of the audience understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Anna's death had some hidden aspects.
 

 
[On one side is protecting her sister, and on the other side is a stranger she has just met—she would probably see through it but choose to keep quiet.]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Xu Zhu’s true self is so selfish. However, I’m quite interested. Such a cruel and selfish person should be very intriguing on a talent show. I want to catch up on "Star Selection Girls" now.]
 

 
[I came from "Star Selection Girls," where I was into her sweet and soft princess persona. I can't accept this change... I'm unfollowing. Compared to her, Tong Zhao and this foreign actor are much more likable and charming.]
 

 
[Speechless!! I was into the sisterly Yuri dynamic based on the plot setup, but with the younger sister being so toxic, I can’t keep up with it.]
 

 
How Tong Zhao will handle this unexpected development has become a major dilemma.
 

 
Killing someone demands a price, but Feng Sisi's crime is rather subtle.
 

 
Moreover, it would be strange for the sister to actually kill her.
 

 
If she lets her off lightly, the audience's perception of Tong Zhao will also become subtle.
 

 
The key point is—
 

 
It’s inherently inappropriate for Tong Zhao to act as a judge.
 

 
Why should she?
 

 
Yet, she’s the only one who can make this judgment. Given her previous demeanor and actions, pretending not to notice would only lead to the audience, who stand on moral high ground and love to make cold comments, steering the narrative. In this era of instinct-driven cinema, even villains and shameless people can have fan appeal. The worst is a muddled, indecisive, and mediocre personality.
 

 
It wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, but she had to take the fall.
 

 
Tong Zhao pushed away the zombie, closed the toilet lid, placed the nearly dead Anna on top, and adjusted Anna’s head to face the right way.
 

 
As the audience wondered what Tong Zhao was going to do, she cast a cold glance at Feng Sisi.
 

 
“There’s not much time left.”
 

 
In the next moment, things took an unexpected turn.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Feng Sisi’s knee with precise force, making her collapse to the ground, her knee striking the dirty, cold floor. As Feng Sisi cried out in pain, Tong Zhao grabbed her by the back of the head and forcefully pressed it down.
 

 
“Sis, what are you doing... Sis... don’t kill me…”
 

 
“Who said I’m going to kill you? I’m not like you. Murder is a grave crime.”
 

 
The director zoomed in for a close-up of Feng Sisi and then cut to a medium shot of the whole scene. Tong Zhao was pressing Feng Sisi’s head to make her bow in front of Anna. Tong Zhao had also positioned Anna’s face to ensure she could see this moment clearly: “Apologize to her.”
 

 
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. I saw the zombie as soon as I opened the door. I was scared too!"
 

 
Feng Sisi sobbed uncontrollably.
 

 
"You were scared, you could have run away, you could have asked me for help. It's really hard to believe how you’ve changed. Feng Sisi, if you truly felt guilty, you wouldn’t have lied to me just now."
 

 
With her face pressed to the floor, Feng Sisi, her dignity shattered, shouted back, "I'm your sister! You want me to apologize to a stranger and even hit me! Who is the real sister here?"
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored her and continued to press her head down until Anna, having lost too much blood, finally passed away. Then, she pulled Feng Sisi off the floor and said, "Clean yourself up and get in the car."
 

 
Feng Sisi, quietly crying, used a tissue to wipe off the dirt. With the city's water supply contaminated, she dared not turn on the faucet to wash her face, fearing contamination through her mucous membranes. Her once-white forehead was now marked with red bruises, looking pitifully tragic and forlorn.
 

 
"You’re so frightening. I really didn’t do it on purpose..."
 

 
The close-up shot clearly captured Feng Sisi’s guilty expression.
 

 
"Alright, let's say it wasn't intentional,"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around, sweeping her bangs back to reveal her smooth, full forehead. Her pale skin was almost translucent, accentuating her short, jet-black hair. Her cold, exquisite beauty momentarily made one forget their surroundings: "Someone died for you. Is it too much to ask for you to bow dozens of times in apology? Or do you want to die here like her?"
 

 
"With the blood supply to the retina being compromised from massive blood loss, Anna would soon experience dizziness and blindness. What did she feel seeing me before she died? Was she scared and helpless? My actions may seem extreme, but they were the only way to make her feel a little better in that moment."
 

 
In "The Story of Ming Emperor," Tong Zhao’s voice was soft and sweet, capable of infusing even the simplest phrases with a tender, lingering tone that stirred listeners’ hearts. On some male-dominated forums, quotes from Concubine Chen were even edited into standalone audio clips, with high download numbers.
 

 
But in "Countdown 72 Hours," the same voice was cold and sharp, with a slight rasp.
 

 
This time, female viewers found it quite satisfying.
 

 
Previously, while the audience enjoyed watching Tong Zhao's head-bowing actions, they also found it a bit strange.
 

 
After all, the female lead, Feng Yanqi, shouldn’t have such a personality.
 

 
People admire strength but also fear extreme violence.
 

 
But after Tong Zhao’s explanation, the emotional logic made sense. It highlighted her strength while still showing her softer, human side. A paranoid madman can be captivating in certain situations, but a warm, positive personality is the mainstream choice.
 

 
[Despite how brutal Tong Zhao was earlier, why do I feel she’s so warm?]
 

 
[I’ve become her fan! She’s so cool, absolutely amazing!]
 

 
[As an M, I really envy Feng Sisi...]
 

 
[I’ve already edited out the clip of Feng Sisi being forced to bow. I’m declaring it the most stress-relieving video of the year. Selfish people like her should be made to bow to Anna—bow hard and bow fiercely!]
 

 
Men are quick to solve their business in the restroom. Song Kaiyu, who was waiting in the car listening to music, was surprised to see only two people return when three had left. His girlfriend remained her usual calm self, while Feng Sisi looked particularly disheveled. Her eyes were as red as a rabbit's, clearly from crying, and her forehead was also bruised.
 

 
"What happened?"
 

 
Song Kaiyu, puzzled, took out iodine from the car's first aid kit and a bottle of mineral water, asking Feng Sisi to clean the wound on her forehead.
 

 
Feng Sisi gratefully accepted the items.
 

 
In response to Song Kaiyu’s questions, she shook her head, tears welling up at the corners of her eyes. She glanced at her sister with immense grievance, her feelings left unspoken.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t pay much attention to her performance and simply said, “Anna was attacked by a zombie in the restroom, and we couldn’t save her in time.”
 

 
Internal conflicts are detrimental to the whole team.
 

 
Under the pressing time and harsh conditions, Tong Zhao had no intention of delving further into the matter before finding the antidote.
 

 
Seeing that her sister didn’t expose her, Feng Sisi let out a quiet sigh of relief.
 

 
“Well, it can’t be helped. If I had known, I would have gone in with you. Let’s make sure we stick together next time, no matter what.” Song Kaiyu, who was unaware of the full truth, was deeply troubled. It was hard for him to accept that someone who had been with them moments ago was now dead. The sense of despair from the zombie outbreak overwhelmed him.
 

 
“Okay, Kaiyu, I’m really scared…”
 

 
The comfort she couldn’t find from her sister, she fully sought from Kaiyu.
 

 
Feng Sisi looked at him brightly.
 

 
Unfortunately, he was too preoccupied with mourning the loss of a teammate to notice her subtle advances.
 

 
He didn’t realize it, but the onlooking audience saw it all clearly.
 

 
[No way, is someone really trying to hit on the sister’s boyfriend? Did I misread the character setting? Is this really the timid and sweet younger sister? This is quite eye-opening.]
 

 
[It’s probably a case of desperation leading to a hasty solution. Is Tong Zhao’s “true self” really this bad at comforting people?]
 

 
[Huh? Are you kidding me? Tong Zhao wasn’t good enough? Every time a zombie appeared, she was the first to protect her teammates. If I were in a ranked game and encountered such a pro, I’d be scrambling to hug their leg and call them 'daddy.' Noobs who win by luck need someone to comfort them? Do they think they’re a princess or something?]
 

 
[Coming from "Star Selection Girls," I’m really disgusted...]
 

 
[This might be just instinct-driven cinema.]
 

 
Ordinary viewers were reflecting on human nature, while fans of Tang Jingjie were becoming agitated: [Monsters and demons stay away from my baby, Mama doesn’t approve of this marriage!]
 

 
[It’s normal to have a CP in acting, and being with the female lead is quite good—she can protect and take care of the baby.]
 

 
...
 

 
From similar comments, it’s clear that the proportion of Tang Jingjie’s fans who are his "mama fans" is extraordinarily high.
 

 
Back to the show.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s calm analysis of the street, zombies are light-sensitive and will only be active indoors during the day. She instructed Song Kaiyu to avoid shaded areas while driving. Sure enough, when they passed under a bridge, they spotted a zombie lying on the road, asleep.
 

 
Just as the audience was praising the female lead for her intelligence and bravery, an off-road vehicle appeared, blocking their path.
 

 
“There are other survivors in the city!”
 

 
Song Kaiyu’s eyes lit up, and Feng Sisi also became alert.
 

 
She didn’t want to continue living under her sister’s control.
 

 
After causing the woman’s death, she felt her sister wouldn’t protect her unconditionally as she used to…
 

 
“Be careful, hold your gun steady,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had previously maintained a neutral expression, showed a slight change in her demeanor, without any joy at encountering other survivors.
 

 
Deep down, Tong Zhao’s intuition warned her that, in extreme conditions, living humans could be more dangerous than zombies…
 

 
Outside the show, the entire directing team was suddenly energized.
 

 
"Alright, alright, the plot is finally getting back on track."
 

 
The somewhat irrelevant screenwriter was deeply moved: "Is the conflict I designed finally going to be put to use?"
 

 
In the setting, even if people come into contact with contaminated sources, some individuals with unique genes or constitutions don’t die immediately but instead gradually turn into zombies, becoming increasingly malevolent in the last three days.
 

 
The main characters encounter a small group of villains.
 

 
In the face of the conflict, the male lead, Song Kaiyu, showed courage and responsibility, while Feng Sisi, as an intern nurse, treated their wounds afterward, demonstrating the "every member is useful, each with their own shining qualities" trope of typical mainstream drama...
 

 
An off-road vehicle aggressively stopped their car, and a muscular Black man got out with a hockey stick:
 

 
"Hand over your supplies and women!"
 

 
He keenly spotted the Asian girl in the passenger seat, his eyes lighting up.
 

 
A woman?
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow: "Is he calling me?”
 

 
The three had been living abroad for some time and had encountered people of various qualities. They naturally did not judge others by skin color, but it was clear that the newcomer was hostile. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth and said, "I will protect you..."
 

 
"I understand English. He’s asking the women to get out of the car."
 

 
Tong Zhao expertly chambered her gun and opened the car door. "Wait for me in the car.”
# Chapter18
"Yes, get out of the car, just like that..."
 

 
Seeing that the only man was staying in the car, Tong Zhao got out alone, and the thief showed a satisfied, sinister smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao exited the car slowly, so slowly that it should have attracted the attention of a professional.
 

 
Unfortunately...
 

 
The thief in front of her wasn’t a trained police officer or a seasoned gang member but just a thug who had survived a little longer in the virus outbreak. Since the main characters lacked special abilities, the screenwriter and template team wouldn’t set up overly harsh scenarios to force their death.
 

 
In reality, if the confrontation became too dire, the director would find ways to introduce some last-minute adjustments to turn the situation around.
 

 
The thief only saw half of Tong Zhao’s body.
 

 
As she was about to fully exit the car, she suddenly drew her gun and fired multiple shots aimed at his legs, turning them into a bloody mess in an instant!
 

 
"Oh, damn it, how dare this bitch, where did she get a gun…”
 

 
The thief cried out in pain and collapsed to the ground.
 

 
Seeing that he had lost his ability to move, Tong Zhao didn’t fire another shot at him but instead aimed at the remaining people in the off-road vehicle.
 

 
...
 

 
[Damn, the princess is so fierce.]
 

 
[I actually worried about Zhao for a moment there, sorry. Here’s a virtual cigarette for Zhao.]
 

 
[Victim 1, finally taking action against living people!]
 

 
A gust of wind blew, lifting Tong Zhao’s jet-black short hair and revealing her delicate, porcelain-like white face. In stark contrast to her earlier cold demeanor in the car, she now wore a triumphant smile: “If a hockey stick and a knife are your strongest weapons, then it's time for me to set the rules of the game. Everyone get out of the car!”
 

 
The thieves were stunned.
 

 
Feng Sisi was also frightened. She grabbed Song Kaiyu's arm, nearly in tears: “Oh my God, how could my sister anger those people? Couldn’t we have just given away some of our supplies? We already left a lot at the gas station... Did she really shoot at them?”
 

 
She still hoped for a peaceful resolution through negotiation.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated but disagreed with her logic: “These people clearly aren’t good. It wouldn’t be solved just by giving up some supplies. Even if we gave everything, they might not spare us, and did you hear? They also want women.”
 

 
Feng Sisi was disheartened by his scolding.
 

 
Song Kaiyu kept his eyes fixed on the off-road vehicle, gripping his small gun tightly: “I need to find a way to help Yanqi…”
 

 
The ideal situation would be cooperation among multiple people.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the attacker, with two teammates in the car providing fire support. Unfortunately, their shooting skills were poor; they could barely manage blind shooting at zombies. It was unrealistic to expect them to accurately hit enemies during close combat. Tong Zhao didn’t want to risk being shot by her teammates, so she gave up on relying on them.
 

 
But she still handed the gun to her boyfriend, investing in a potential asset.
 

 
“Bitch!”
 

 
The accomplices in the car cursed, and a dark hole appeared. Tong Zhao shouted for everyone to get down, using the car as cover, and clenched her teeth: “Get out of the car, we have to fight them!”
 

 
Their vehicle had gasoline, and if it exploded, everyone inside would be done for.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t immediately think of this and, believing his girlfriend needed help, got out of the car without hesitation. Only Feng Sisi stayed inside the car, hiding from the bullets and refusing to come out.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her, but squeezed next to Tong Zhao: “Is there anything I can do?”
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled a cigarette from her pocket: “Light this for me.”
 

 
...
 

 
Song Kaiyu quickly used a lighter to ignite the cigarette in her mouth.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll rush out and kill them all. Don’t shoot randomly. If I get restrained, you start shooting. I’ll try to turn his body towards you... Got it?”
 

 
“Understood.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu nodded quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao examined him for a moment more, making sure he truly understood, before giving a slight nod.
 

 
The thieves continued to threaten, but upon seeing that the Asians were armed, they dared not rush in easily, resulting in a standoff.
 

 
Then, Tong Zhao heard the sound of an engine starting.
 

 
Her pupils contracted—
 

 
In a situation where they had inferior firepower, using the off-road vehicle to try and ram Song Kaiyu's ordinary car was a viable strategy. She indeed had no time left; how could she physically confront a vehicle? She wasn't a superhero.
 

 
She had to rely on the thieves' poor shooting skills, and their lack of ruthlessness compared to hers.
 

 
When the narrow path meets, the brave prevail!
 

 
"I'm going.”
 

 
Tong Zhao darted out, crouching to minimize her target area.
 

 
She didn't just rush out; she also fired her gun continuously to cover her advance. The situation unfolded as she had expected. In their panic, even though the robbers emptied their bullets, their accuracy was atrocious. By the time Tong Zhao charged into the vehicle, they had only managed to hit her thigh...
 

 
[Tong Zhao went all out!]
 

 
[Damn, slow-motion, slow-motion, I need to see this in slow-mo!]
 

 
[Give up… Slow-motion can only be watched with a purchase, oh my god, Tong Zhao's real self is so brave… Did the director implant combat skills into her memory? But such life-or-death courage can't be simulated by a template… I'm starting to get curious about the actor herself.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is amazing!!! (Very loud)]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s Superman-like performance completely conquered the audience.
 

 
“Damn…”
 

 
Even Superman can bleed and feel pain. She furrowed her brow and let out the first curse word spoken by the protagonist in the series. The remaining robbers, barely clinging to life, stared at this Eastern girl with a face younger than most white high school students with confusion and suspicion: “Who exactly are you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave them a cold glance.
 

 
With severe injuries and blood loss, the robbers' vision began to blur, and they could only see a flickering flame.
 

 
She exhaled a smoke ring and smiled: “Wing Chun.”
 

 
……
 

 
[……Hey!]
 

 
[The stereotype that all Chinese people know martial arts is hard to shake.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s teasing made me really happy :D]
 

 
“I’m just kidding; I’m actually a high school PE teacher,” Tong Zhao said, patting one of the big men’s faces, ash falling onto his nose. “You ended up in this situation because you didn’t study hard enough back in the day. Now, let me give you your last lesson.”
 

 
“Damn, the thing I hate most in life is teachers… How could a teacher possibly have such good marksmanship…”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because I had extra time after being forced to take English, math, physics, and chemistry classes, so I used that time to practice shooting.”
 

 
This was a made-up story.
 

 
There was no such plot setting.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually stubbed out the cigarette on his arm: “We Chinese believe in reincarnation. Remember to be a good person in your next life, attend classes properly, and respect women.”
 

 
She poked her head out and waved to her teammates: “Come over here.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu hurried over.
 

 
“Move the bodies from the car and bring over the supplies. We’re switching to this vehicle; it’s more durable.”
 

 
The headlights were smashed when the SUV forced them to stop earlier, and Tong Zhao didn’t want to leave any safety hazards. Plus, the SUV was better at resisting zombie attacks. Song Kaiyu was dazed by the first sentence, but since he had just said he would find a way to help his girlfriend, he gritted his teeth and carried on.
 

 
He asked quietly, “Yanqi, aren’t you scared?”
 

 
[It’s likely that our boss, Zhao, isn’t afraid of mere mortal emotions.]
 

 
[One cigarette, boundless magical power.]
 

 
[555555 The little one must be very scared. Hugs to our little hero.]
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the passenger seat of the SUV, the car’s dim light casting a glow on her nose and lips. In an instant, she looked cold and beautiful, almost unearthly, like a knife quietly shining in the dark. How could a knife have fearful emotions?
 

 
“I’m afraid. Why wouldn’t I be?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze to him, her eyes having been tested under close-up scrutiny:
 

 
“I’m afraid of death, afraid of pain, and of course, afraid of zombies. I fear everything a normal person would fear, but my emotions can be separated from my actions. I want to survive, and ideally, I want everyone to survive with me.”
 

 
For some reason, when she said the last sentence, Tong Zhao sounded unusually resolute.
 

 
One reason is that Duan Ge’s mission in the apocalypse scenario was to save specific characters. The second reason is that Duan Ge is one of the kinder personalities in Tong Zhao.
 

 
Because Duan Ge had witnessed cruelty and misfortune in the apocalypse scenario, she deeply understood the bright, warm, and soft aspects of human nature. That’s why Tong Zhao was confident in having her play the role in the film. Duan Ge would neither be an annoying saint nor a terrifying villain.
 

 
She could be ruthless in combat, but her underlying personality is gentle.
 

 
After hearing this, Song Kaiyu was speechless.
 

 
He was overwhelmed with regret.
 

 
How could he have asked such a rude question, “Aren’t you afraid?” just because his girlfriend seemed strong? Yan Qi, like him, was a human who feared pain and death, but she endured her fear to protect him and to survive.
 

 
The audience shared his thoughts.
 

 
From the start of the broadcast, Tong Zhao's portrayal had been that of a tough, no-nonsense heroine, who shows no fear. While they enjoyed the thrill and felt the show was worth the price, there was a sense of distance. After all, gods and humans are different, and the killing god was impressive.
 

 
When Tong Zhao admitted her fear, she transformed from a deity into a human.
 

 
It wasn’t that she was no longer impressive, but rather that the audience could now empathize with her.
 

 
On the barrage, fewer people were calling her "Empress," and more were starting to refer to her as "Zhao-ge," with some even calling her "Wife" and "Zhao-cub"—
 

 
Song Kaiyu gave her a long look, his eyes reddened as he awkwardly turned away. “I’ll go get our stuff.”
 

 
“Okay, bring me the makeup bag from the car.”
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
[Makeup bag 23333 It’s true that wanting to look good is a woman’s nature.]
 

 
[The empress who wouldn't step out without new clothes is back!]
 

 
Song Kaiyu thought, just like the barrage, that Tong Zhao wanted to do her makeup and found her cute, so he smiled slightly. He worried that the items in her bag might not be enough, so he asked Feng Sisi, who had been hiding in the backseat pretending to be dead, “Can I borrow the makeup bag? Your sister needs it.”
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at him in disbelief. “What time is it, and she’s still thinking about makeup?”
 

 
After speaking, she remembered that she should also touch up her makeup and mumbled, “No, I need to use mine. Just use hers.”
 

 
The audience was used to this selfish behavior from the younger sister.
 

 
Some even noted her lines as the most classic example of a petty “true self” for the second half of the year.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her and hurriedly handed the makeup bag to Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
She lit another cigarette, still holding it between her lips.
 

 
Can a woman do her makeup while smoking? The audience grew a bit curious.
 

 
At this point, Song Kaiyu had already started to reluctantly move the bodies from the car. He deserved some screen time, but Tong Zhao’s next action immediately drew the attention of the AI, and the director couldn’t bear to cut away the shot—
 

 
Tong Zhao cut open a section of her shorts, revealing the area where she had been shot.
 

 
That piece of snow-white skin had already turned into an ugly, bright red.
# Chapter19
Inside the off-road vehicle’s cargo area.
 

 
Tong Zhao, with a blank expression, took the eyebrow tweezers from the makeup bag and used a lighter to sterilize them before using them on her wound…
 

 
In instinctual films, some memories can be erased and not brought into reality.
 

 
Certain memories of torture and bed scenes, after being reviewed by professionals, are selectively erased to prevent psychological trauma for the actors. Conversely, when actors need to perform difficult action scenes, they might be given a certain level of pain exemption to boost their courage.
 

 
In instinctual films, characters only perceive it as “adrenaline kicking in” or “the pain isn’t as bad as expected.” However, *Countdown 72 Hours* doesn’t involve such high difficulty levels, so pain exemptions were never applied to the actors.
 

 
When pain exemptions are granted, the percentage is also displayed in the film.
 

 
This can be seen as a form of recognition for particularly resilient actors. Some tough male actors take pride in this, and those who endure pain above level III without exemptions often form their own small circles in WeChat groups, sharing resources and recommendations.
 

 
Mature actresses scoffed at this, saying who hasn’t experienced level IV pain?
 

 
In any case, there are currently no female actresses in this small group.
 

 
“How much of a pain exemption should be granted to Tong Zhao?”
 

 
The staff asked.
 

 
The director, focusing intently on the screen, had access to an actor’s various status indicators in an area unseen by the audience. This allows the director to detect and prevent any potential breakdowns before the actor does.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal status panel…
 

 
Was surprisingly normal.
 

 
“Don’t rush to apply the exemption. Let’s observe for now,” the director said.
 

 
The wound did not contain a complete bullet; Tong Zhao removed all the metal fragments without even furrowing her brow. The only sign of her true pain was the sweat covering her forehead and the fact that she smoked two more cigarettes.
 

 
Close up, sweat beads fell from Tong Zhao’s high-bridged nose, creating a beautiful arc that made one’s heart tremble.
 

 
The director gave her many close-ups, and she handled the intense camera work well. Despite her immense pain, her light-colored eyes occasionally lost focus and her breathing became labored. In stark contrast, her hands moved with an emotional detachment, meticulously removing each metal shard from her flesh and tossing them aside with frustration before applying a simple bandage from the off-road vehicle's first aid kit.
 

 
During this process, Song Kaiyu, who was transporting supplies, noticed her treating her own wound. Shocked and heartbroken, he hesitated to speak, afraid of disturbing her. Timing it carefully, he handed her a bottle of opened mineral water, a small packet of bread, and a small pack of sugar to replenish her energy after she finished bandaging her wound.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the mineral water and chugged it down.
 

 
“Drink slowly, be careful not to choke.”
 

 
Seeing her drink hurriedly, Song Kaiyu attentively handed her a tissue and opened the small packet of bread for her.
 

 
This scene…
 

 
He looked just like a gentle and virtuous girlfriend!
 

 
“What’s there to thank me for?” Song Kaiyu chuckled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, accepted his logic, and smiled at him, saying, “I was wrong.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile was very gentle. In this film, she smiled rarely, and when she did, it was often in a wild, over-the-top way during fight scenes, as if she was about to say ‘Why so serious?’ This tender smile was like a refreshing spring, so sweet it melted the audience’s hearts.
 

 
[Wow, wow, I finally feel the chemistry between the male and female leads after all this time!]
 

 
[The female lead looks so adorable when she smiles!]
 

 
[I’m officially a fan of Zhao Bao now!!]
 

 
[Guys can admire too.]
 

 
Song Kaiyu was momentarily stunned by her smile.
 

 
In their character relationship set up, they were a couple. Tang Jingjie had no ill feelings toward her personally and had been treating her as his girlfriend since getting into character. Now, moved by her smile, he straightforwardly held her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse but looked at the hand being held with some confusion.
 

 
In the apocalypse scenario, there were no male characters to pursue. Apart from protecting specific female characters, Duan Ge had never been in a romantic relationship, leading to a near-innocent clumsiness in handling romantic matters. To put it simply…
 

 
“Are you scared?”
 

 
Tong Zhao clasped his hand in return: “Don’t be afraid; I’m here.”
 

 
??
 

 
??
 

 
The audience was filled with question marks.
 

 
What are you talking about?
 

 
Although you’re very brave, isn’t that the male lead’s line?
 

 
It’s enough; everyone already knows you’re super brave. Let the male lead have a break!
 

 
And because Tang Jingjie’s personality is gentle, without the big-man ego of Wan Zhuo, his portrayal of Song Kaiyu smoothly accepted this setting and bumped heads with her: “It’s really reassuring to have you by my side.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite pleased.
 

 
It felt great to be trusted by a companion.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was also happy; his girlfriend was so strong and gave him a strong sense of security.
 

 
Only the scriptwriter was unhappy.
 

 
The scriptwriter repeatedly banged his head against the director's tropical fish tank: “Reverse CP! Reverse CP!”
 

 
The innocent tropical fish, clueless about what was happening, scattered in fear.
 

 
※
 

 
Feng Sisi noticed that no one came to persuade her to change cars and saw that the supplies had been moved. Fearing that her sister would abandon her, she walked over with a look of grievance. When she climbed into the SUV, she found the two of them cuddling together, and the warm atmosphere made her feel a pang of sadness.
 

 
It's not that she likes her brother-in-law that much.
 

 
It’s just that, seeing her sister so wronged and distressed, how can others be happy while leaving her out?
 

 
"Brother Kaiyu, are you hurt?"
 

 
Feng Sisi, noticing the bloodstains on the ground and the bandages in the trash can, rushed over anxiously: “Sis, let me see. I didn’t waste my time interning at the hospital; I do know a bit of first aid…”
 

 
“Uh,” Song Kaiyu stopped her outstretched hand and continued speaking: “I’m not hurt. By the time we got in the car, those robbers were already dead. It’s your sister who got shot in the thigh. She just used tweezers to extract the bullet fragments.”
 

 
……
 

 
This was quite awkward.
 

 
[Let the injured person take a look, Feng Sisi, you’re really something.]
 

 
[Help, my embarrassment is acting up. I really want to skip the parts with her and just watch the female lead solo.]
 

 
[To be honest, Feng Sisi is just like a useless accessory and even got Miss Anna killed.]
 

 
In all artistic works, people naturally dislike those who hold them back.
 

 
Moreover, Feng Sisi’s performance not only shows her lack of insight and usefulness but also lacks the traits of kindness and gentleness. She isn't a major villain but reveals selfish details in the finer points.
 

 
The sense of immersion is too strong.
 

 
We don’t get to see villains who are ruthless in real life, but who hasn’t encountered self-righteous and selfish people in everyday life?
 

 
However, it’s not entirely a negative evaluation.
 

 
A comment [I won't watch face-slapping dramas without Xu Zhu as the villain; that bowing scene was so relieving] received 99 likes, indicating that sometimes, the most seemingly insignificant roles can stand out and be appreciated.
 

 
"Sis, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were hurt.”
 

 
Feng Sisi, knowing she was in the wrong, apologized hesitantly.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even glance at her, opening the window and lighting a cigarette: “Let’s head to the research institute. Don’t waste time.”
 

 
Seeing that her sister was ignoring her, Feng Sisi finally panicked.
 

 
In the current situation, she had no one else to rely on besides her sister. Her previous words had a hint of living off her sister’s kindness, but since she accidentally caused Anna’s death, she felt her sister’s attitude had completely changed.
 

 
She tried to boost her favorability: “Sis, you should smoke less; it’s bad for your health.”
 

 
“Not smoking hurts.”
 

 
The camera captured Tong Zhao’s cold and refined features as if sculpted by wind and snow, immaculate and noble.
 

 
Feng Sisi was taken aback: “Huh?”
 

 
“Not smoking will hurt your mouth,” Tong Zhao clarified.
 

 
Feng Sisi fell silent, finally realizing, just a little, how selfish she had been and that she had never truly paid attention to the suffering her sister had endured.
 

 
She secretly felt relieved that her sister was always there to protect her from such physical suffering.
 

 
As nightfall approached, Tong Zhao insisted on finding a place to hide and stay as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the zombies’ attention.
 

 
Although Feng Sisi was eager to obtain the antidote as soon as possible, she dared not oppose her sister's wishes.
 

 
Soon, the changing environment confirmed that Tong Zhao’s approach was correct.
 

 
After night fell, the city became a playground for zombies. Even the slightest sound would draw their attention. The three of them hid in the car, remaining so quiet that not a single word was spoken. Feng Sisi, terrified by the sight of zombies roaming outside the car window, quietly edged closer to Tong Zhao in the darkness.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t sleep well.
 

 
With Feng Sisi on her right and Song Kaiyu on her left, how could she possibly get any rest?
 

 
This cozy scene gave the behind-the-scenes staff a sense of satisfaction as if the plot had finally gotten back on track.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Don’t get too excited. How will you get into the research institute without Anna’s fingerprint?"
 

 
Screenwriter: "And there’s a whole series of deadly traps inside. The female lead is injured... Do you think these two are useful? Maybe it's better to take the chance now to lower the difficulty inside the research institute and just have them walk straight into a ‘Grand Opening Free Antidote Giveaway’ event?"
 

 
The others glanced at him, concluding that he was rambling due to the chaos caused by the altered plot.
 

 
"No need to lower the difficulty just yet. I want to see how far the female lead can go in this apocalypse live show."
 

 
A male voice cut in, and everyone in the backstage immediately put down their work and turned to the source of the voice, including the director, who gave a respectful look: “Supervisor.”
 

 
The man referred to as the supervisor was about twenty-five years old, strikingly handsome, with tea-colored eyes that gave him a slightly stern appearance. He wore a long black trench coat, jeans, and combat boots, moving as if he had his own background music and wind.
 

 
"She’s very interesting."


 
The supervisor’s gaze fell on the screen, where Tong Zhao’s face, flushed with fever, was visible.
 

 
The female lead had a fever.
# Chapter20
Tong Zhao's sleeping face captured the audience’s attention.
 

 
The girl, who had been resolute and formidable like a war deity since the broadcast began, suddenly showed signs of vulnerability, making people feel even more pity and sympathy for her. One of the advantages of live broadcasts in instinct films is that both your strengths and weaknesses are visible to the audience. If you have the talent, it will shine.
 

 
With each cough, her long eyelashes fluttered lightly—
 

 
With such beauty, why endure such suffering?
 

 
Many viewers felt a pang of sorrow upon seeing this scene, and even the backstage staff were no exception. Only the cold-hearted screenwriter proudly revealed the truth: "The faster the heartbeat, the quicker the virus spreads in the blood. Combined with her injury and lowered immunity, her blood virus concentration should be higher than others."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Everyone turned to look at him.
 

 
"These are things Anna would have originally reminded them about, but now the strategy is gone..."
 

 
The screenwriter shrugged and put on an innocent expression.
 

 
Clearly, it’s not his fault!
 

 
It’s all Xuzhu’s "true self" being too selfish!
 

 
His CP was reversed and the plot was altered, which was already quite tragic!
 

 
The director pulled up Tong Zhao’s personal data, and her temperature had risen to 65%, showing signs of fever: “Besides the fever, what else is there?”
 

 
“Well, if you want to talk about this, there’s plenty more,” the screenwriter listed off: “Though she feels hot to the touch, the infected person will experience cold hands and feet, a sense of mental confusion, occasional random body pains, and an increasingly strong desire to suck blood… If Anna were still alive, or if they had cooperated every time they faced difficulties, the average value should have been around 60% by the time they reached the final level, with these symptoms being quite mild.”
 

 
But now?
 

 
The assistant director pulled up the personal data of the other two actors. Song Kaiyu was at 50%, while Feng Sisi’s was shockingly low at only 43%. This proved that playing dead and doing nothing was indeed very effective. Considering her performance every time they encountered a challenge, even knowing it was just a movie, people couldn’t help but question Xuzhu’s character.
 

 
How can we pass the final level with a patient, a bystander, and a selfish person?
 

 
Everyone's expressions changed.
 

 
Only the supervisor showed interest: “This background setting can be shown to the audience. Also, make sure to synchronize and publicly release the personal data.”
 

 
“This…”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Isn’t it what everyone loves to watch in live movies?”
 

 
The supervisor was very amiable, lacking the domineering CEO vibe, and his fox-like eyes were smiling.
 

 
But once he spoke, no one dared to contradict him. The director immediately had people act according to his instructions.
 

 
The supervisor found this little actor interesting and wanted to give her a helping hand, a favor in passing. The stubborn “true self” would suffer in silence when unnoticed, but if handled correctly, it could quickly attract fans. After all, the most loyal fans are those who have been through hardship.
 

 
Sure enough, once this newly introduced data-checking feature became familiar to the audience, the discussion heat skyrocketed exponentially.
 

 
The official sources didn’t directly indicate the relationship between infection levels and fever, but based on previous clues from the official blog about the story’s background, it was easy to deduce. Observant viewers made inferences, while those less inclined to think later received educational content, leading to the understanding of one fact—
 

 
Tong Zhao is the one who put in the most effort, so she’s the most severely infected.
 

 
Then there’s the guy who’s useless at everything, but still alive with a 43% infection rate.
 

 
[Can I say I envy Feng Sisi a lot? If I had an older sister like that, I could win just by lying down.]
 

 
[Seeing her dragging behind is so annoying.]
 

 
[My heart aches for the sister…]
 

 
In instinctive movies, the suffering of actors is the most real, leading to the emergence of a specific audience group.
 

 
They were originally reality show viewers, interested in seeing how far others could push their limits, dissatisfied with traditional movies for lacking authenticity and failing to engage the audience’s emotions. Instinctive movies perfectly cater to this hidden preference.
 

 
When this audience learned about the shooting mishaps in "Countdown 72 Hours," they flocked to watch the live stream.
 

 
Especially the video of Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove bullet fragments from her flesh.
 

 
So exciting!
 

 
Even if paying to enter now means only experiencing one-third of the content, it’s still worth it.
 

 
In instinctive movies, viruses are not just about adding a poisoning debuff.
 

 
Humans enter the holographic system with their consciousness, and the virus is another string of code. The effects of different codes vary. Because it involves human nerves, the difficulty of creating these codes is quite high. The production team usually prefers to purchase existing virus code rights because it is much cheaper and safer than creating a new virus code.
 

 
The virus code used in "Countdown 72 Hours" is codenamed [Desire].
 

 
It’s quite well-known.
 

 
Because it’s cost-effective and fits the general public's imagination of zombie viruses, it’s popular.
 

 
At a 65% infection rate, movement difficulties begin to appear.
 

 
Every virus has a ranking chart showing how long actors' “selves” were able to continue performing after reaching a certain infection level.
 

 
Some viruses that cause immediate breakdown are rarely purchased by production teams.
 

 
After all, the show must go on.
 

 
[Desire] is a more moderate choice. At the top of the ranking chart is Darren, a foreign actor from "Glacial Survival." In the freezing cold, with a 70% infection rate, he lasted 20 minutes until the rescue team arrived. It was said that the director was most worried he might attack the female lead, but fortunately, the couple was married in real life, and the female lead had just given birth to their baby. Their strong relationship helped Darren suppress his instincts.
 

 
Tong Zhao is currently at 65%.
 

 
But her challenge is not just to endure the desire to attack the living.
 

 
It’s about moving, using both mind and body to find the antidote.
 

 
[Feels like this movie might end badly, the female lead has already come a long way.]
 

 
[Not easy, and if she doesn’t find the antidote, don’t mock her.]
 

 
[Admiring how the female lead has persisted until now with a sidekick who only tags along and drags on her progress.]
 

 
[Female lead’s Weibo handle @Tongzhao, come join us in supporting the fierce and cool Empress!]
 

 
"Cough, cough..."
 

 
The Empress was awakened by the coughing.
 

 
Just after a few coughs, Song Kaiyu next to her quickly covered her mouth.
 

 
It wasn't fully dawn yet, so they couldn't cough too loudly and attract the zombies' attention.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him gratefully.
 

 
"You're running a fever...?" Song Kaiyu asked in a very low voice, leaning close to her ear.
 

 
"A little," Tong Zhao said as she touched her forehead, hesitating, "It feels different from the usual cold and fever, maybe it's a change due to the virus. Do you feel uncomfortable?"
 

 
"My throat seems a bit inflamed.”
 

 
The two of them conversed softly.
 

 
With an infection level of 50%, Song Kaiyu began to feel slight discomfort. He sympathetically held Tong Zhao's hand and said, "Even though my stamina isn't great, you can rely on me. Whatever you think I can handle, just let me do it."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Get some more sleep; it's not dawn yet."
 

 
Song Kaiyu shifted slightly, allowing Tong Zhao to lean against him.
 

 
The director captured this moment between the two with a separate shot, excluding Feng Sisi from the frame.
 

 
So what if the female is strong and the male is weak?
 

 
It can still be heartwarming and sweet.
 

 
At this moment, most of the audience sensed the chemistry between the two and began to cheer for them in the comments, hoping they could overcome the challenges together.
 

 
※
 

 
When Tong Zhao woke up, she looked much better.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was quite pleased. "Rest is indeed very important."
 

 
However, the audience with the god's-eye view knew that Tong Zhao hadn’t improved at all. Even though she was just sitting and resting, her infection level had risen by another percentage point—she looked better only because she was well-rested and had the energy to suppress her physical discomfort.
 

 
The image of a beautiful, strong, and tragic character was fully on display.
 

 
By the time Song Kaiyu drove the car to the front of the research institute, Tong Zhao’s infection level had reached 68%.
 

 
The research institute was a building about twenty stories high.
 

 
From the outside, it looked like any other office building in the city, but according to Anna, it was equipped with many security measures unfriendly to intruders. The primary challenge was how to enter the building without Anna’s fingerprint.
 

 
The building's doors were completely shut.
 

 
It wasn’t just an ordinary glass door but also a solidly closed metal door.
 

 
Neither manpower nor firearms could break it; blasting methods would be needed.
 

 
[Where’s the demolition team?]
 

 
[There’s no blasting team. It would have been great if the female lead had awakened some special power from her fever last night.]
 

 
[I’m too lazy to comment. This isn’t a supernatural theme… but I really want to see Tong Zhao in an action-packed supernatural movie. She’d be amazing! What was she doing before entering the entertainment industry? She looks like a top soldier!]
 

 
[There were rumors she was a high-end escort during the filming of "The Ming Emperor's Legend." No need to guess anymore; this woman is hard to figure out.]
 

 
Facing the challenge, Feng Sisi looked towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was a very familiar action.
 

 
Many large trucks were parked near the research institute.
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly turned her gaze to the vehicles parked nearby, focusing on one particularly long truck with an open cargo door containing steel bars.
 

 
"I have an idea."
 

 
?
 

 
What have you thought of now?
 

 
Amidst a flurry of question marks in the comments, Tong Zhao smashed all the glass windows of the truck with a wrench. She then reached inside to open the truck door, violently broke open the control panel, and, after studying the wiring for a while, called over Song Kaiyu to help bind several steel bars to the front of the driver’s seat and the passenger seat.
 

 
What was originally an unremarkable truck now had steel bars protruding from its front.
 

 
Tong Zhao then drove the off-road vehicle and forcefully maneuvered the truck, which was originally angled away from the research institute’s main gate, to face directly toward the gate.
 

 
[Hey, I have a bold idea…]
 

 
[Don’t even think about it. No one here has the guts of Zhao Ge.]
 

 
"Step back a bit. The scene might get a bit explosive soon," Tong Zhao instructed.
 

 
Due to the virus affecting her vocal cords, her once melodious voice had become faintly hoarse.
 

 
The two complied obediently and drove the off-road vehicle to the end of the street.
 

 
Next, Tong Zhao crouched down, and found the ignition wire among a tangle of wires, and after several attempts by short-circuiting the positive terminal, she finally heard the engine start! This was a vulnerability of older cars, and since the steering wheel couldn’t be unlocked, Tong Zhao had to adjust the direction in advance…
 

 
With the throttle set to maximum, the truck barreled towards the research institute’s main gate at an unstoppable, suicidal speed.
 

 
At the critical moment, Tong Zhao leaped out of the moving truck through the open door!
 

 
The steel bars acted like an ancient battering ram, smashing through the research institute’s first line of defense. The explosion door and its frame were shattered into pieces. The loud noise stirred the zombies in the city, causing a faint disturbance.
 

 
She rolled on the road and finally came to a stop, with blood slowly seeping through the bandages on her thigh.
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s infection level: 70%]
 

 
She only slightly furrowed her brows.
# Chapter21
“Yan Qi!”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao being thrown out of the truck, both the audience and Song Kaiyu felt their hearts tighten.
 

 
Song Kaiyu rushed over and helped her up.
 

 
The fall was severe, and Tong Zhao, feeling dizzy and disoriented, allowed him to hold her for a moment. The close-up that the audience saw showed her gazing at the male lead’s neck with a look of hunger as they embraced.
 

 
Was she going to bite him?
 

 
Before the tension could fully build, Tong Zhao pushed away from Song Kaiyu's embrace: “I can stand on my own.”
 

 
Tong Zhao stood still, her slender frame upright like a sword with its edge bared—something that could only be observed from a distance and not touched. Just a touch would cut, and a sword didn’t need to be embraced by anyone.
 

 
The three of them climbed through the open cargo container into the driver’s seat and then entered the research institute’s lobby through the window that had been smashed open.
 

 
Like many office buildings, the first floor had a reception desk and elevators.
 

 
The interior decoration was in disarray due to the crash. Since there might be zombies inside, Tong Zhao turned to the group and signaled for silence, and the two immediately shut up, swallowing all their questions.
 

 
The office building was too tall for Tong Zhao to search alone; she might end up poisoned or worse before finding anything. The intelligent AI, detecting the importance of the scene to the plot, broadcasted Tong Zhao's inner monologue at this moment:
 

 
[My physical condition is getting worse. It’s definitely more than just a fever or a cold; the virus must be starting to take effect... Ha, it seems like we don’t have much time left. Or maybe I inadvertently did something that accelerated the virus activation? Forget it, I’ll put that aside for now.]
 

 
The protagonist is truly intelligent!
 

 
Watching a resourceful and capable hero navigate challenges is quite enjoyable.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the injured beauty face these trials makes the audience feel closer to her, evoking a sense of sympathy and hope that fate will be kinder to her.
 

 
With the guide, Anna, having fallen earlier, the director added a schematic map code at the research institute’s reception, essentially providing a map. Tong Zhao looked up at the plastic board nailed to the wall.
 

 
The doctor’s laboratory was on the top floor, the 23rd.
 

 
The elevator was still operational, sparing the three from the grueling climb up the stairs and accelerating their infection.
 

 
In the original script, they were supposed to climb, but the props team estimated that Tong Zhao might become so aggressive during the climb that she could potentially kill the other two. Therefore, the script was changed to allow the use of the elevator.
 

 
However, the elevator only went up to the 20th floor, so they would have to walk the remaining three floors.
 

 
The 21st and 22nd floors were designated as staff dormitories and patient wards respectively. After the virus outbreak, those who hadn’t escaped would likely have become hungry zombies, and they would need to pass through these two floors to reach the 23rd.
 

 
Tong Zhao informed the others of her conclusions.
 

 
“After reaching the 20th floor, we’ll definitely have to fight zombies,”
 

 
Her light-colored eyes were filled with coldness, and her grip on the gun was tight. Only the audience with the God’s-eye view knew that she was barely holding back the murderous urges caused by the virus and had no time to act kindly: “If you’re scared or want to stay back and wait for me to protect you, you can stay here and wait for me to bring back the antidote.”
 

 
“I’ll stay here, so I won’t be a burden to my sister.”
 

 
Feng Sisi quickly made her choice.
 

 
Song Kaiyu pressed his lips together, showing the resolute demeanor expected of a man: “There’s no way I’m letting you go alone. I’ll follow you. Even if it’s just firing at zombies, having an extra person means more firepower. I won’t back down in the face of danger.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, slightly moved.
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Feng Sisi tugged at her sister’s sleeve with a pleading expression: “Don’t leave me alone again. It might not be safe here; there could be zombies sneaking in... What if you don’t get the antidote? Am I just supposed to wait here to die?”
 

 
She was genuinely anxious.
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Help, Feng Sisi is so selfish! Even the screenwriter couldn’t come up with this level of selfishness. Is she only thinking about herself?]
 

 
[How many good deeds did she do in her past life to be reborn as the female lead’s sister?]
 

 
[I accept that her values are skewed, but I really want to see Tong Zhao give her a couple of shots! Autumn pear syrup!]
 

 
Tong Zhao looked down at her, her expressive almond-shaped eyes showing no emotion.
 

 
“Yeah, wait here to die, what else?”
 

 
She spoke with a hint of curiosity, her voice even more hoarse: “Do you think I’m guaranteed to find the antidote? That I’m certain to survive? Stop dreaming. We should have died a long time ago. Right now, we’re just fighting for a sliver of hope in the hands of death. Don’t expect me to rely on you. Just stay put and wait.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice was no longer pleasant to hear.
 

 
It was used for mockery, giving it a different flavor.
 

 
“I don’t mind if you’re useless or foolish, but you’d better obey.”
 

 
She suddenly frowned, biting her lower lip until it cracked and bled.
 

 
“I, I…”
 

 
Feng Sisi was left speechless, her face pale and filled with grievance as she looked at her, silently accusing her of cruelty. Tong Zhao, however, had no interest in watching her performance and asked, “Last chance—will you come with me or stay here?”
 

 
Feng Sisi opened her mouth and then shut it again, finally whispering with tears in her eyes, “I’m too scared to go up…”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t waste any more words with her. She grabbed her by the hair and dragged her onto the truck, then hoisted her up and shoved her head-first into the cargo area. “Stay here. If you don’t want to die, don’t make any noise.”
 

 
This kind of rough, trash-like behavior was unanimously approved by the audience.
 

 
Feng Sisi’s character had gone from being the group’s favorite to a much-despised “green tea sister.” If Tong Zhao were too kind to her, she’d be criticized as a saint.
 

 
Besides, Tong Zhao was right.
 

 
In a life-or-death escape, who has time for such pretentiousness?
 

 
Also, it was the older sister’s protection that had shielded her from hardship, but live-action films have no time for gradual character development. The stronger get stronger, and the foolish remain foolish—an unchanging rule.
 

 
The sun blazed, and everything was laid bare.
 

 
The two of them entered the elevator.
 

 
“Yan Qi, your voice is really hoarse,” Song Kaiyu noticed something.
 

 
“The virus is starting to take effect,” Tong Zhao smiled, recognizing that his voice hadn’t changed yet. “I’m experiencing it worse than you. If I completely lose control and attack you, just…”
 

 
“Then let’s die together.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu interrupted her.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised her eyebrows.
 

 
“I have to admit I’m a rather weak man. I don’t have the resolve to shoot my girlfriend. If one of us is going to survive, it should definitely be you.”
 

 
The elevator was rising quickly, so quickly that she was starting to get a bit of ear pressure.
 

 
Their situations were the same, and Song Kaiyu reached out to touch her ear. “If eating me when the virus takes over makes you feel a bit better, then I’m happy to finally be of some use in this escape journey.”
 

 
With this joking remark, the elevator arrived at the 20th floor.
 

 
The elevator doors slowly opened.
 

 
They had already heard many heavy, dense footsteps, but none of the steps were hesitant.
 

 
[I think, Feng Sisi will never know what she missed.]
 

 
[Can the romance of a strong woman and a weak man be this touching? I’m teary-eyed.]
 

 
[The writer is amazing!!]
 

 
The writer, feeling a mix of emotions and not daring to claim credit, posted a tweet:
 

 
@DailyScriptwriterQiao:
 

 
“The current plot of ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ compared to my script…
 

 
I can’t say it’s identical, but I can say it’s entirely unrelated.”
 

 
*
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, the 21st and 22nd floors were like scenes from hell.
 

 
Fortunately, the two were well-prepared with ample firepower, unloading magazine after magazine. As Song Kaiyu’s hands began to tremble from firing so much, Tong Zhao's infection level visibly soared, peaking from 70% to 80%. In the grand scene, every close-up shot was given to Tong Zhao, while the male lead didn’t get any close-ups.
 

 
Because she was in immense pain.
 

 
Her lower lip was bitten raw, and her beautiful eyes were half-stained gray.
 

 
The zombie horde wouldn’t give them a chance for close combat. The small knife Tong Zhao had prepared was used to cut herself, on her arms, thighs, and shoulders, inflicting pain where it was needed to maintain a minimal level of awareness. By the time they reached the stairway from the 22nd to the 23rd floor, Tong Zhao could no longer move and had to collapse in the stairwell, signaling Song Kaiyu to go up to the 23rd floor to find the antidote.
 

 
Since Song Kaiyu had been relatively unaffected, his lower infection level allowed him to search through all the bottles and jars on the top floor and find the antidote for 【Desire】. This was the margin Tong Zhao had fought to secure for him, and he seized it, grasping the faint glimmer of hope offered by death. Returning to the unconscious Tong Zhao, he personally administered the antidote to her...
 

 
As if fate had already made its arrangements.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, who had been a background character throughout the entire film, ended up having his moment of glory in the end.
 

 
Yet, not a single Tong Zhao fan felt this was undeserved.
 

 
In fact, many thought this scene was even more touching than the previous solo performances of Tong Zhao and were glad that Tong Zhao's trust in him had not been misplaced.
 

 
The two of them relied on each other and fell into an exhausted sleep, waiting for the antidote to take effect.
 

 
There was no strength left to return to the first floor to deliver the antidote to Feng Sisi, who had hoped to lay low until the end.
 

 
And she never mustered the courage to come up and find them before the end of the show.
 

 
[It’s a relief!]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, can I say I cried watching this? It’s over. I’m a fan of Jie Zai’s girlfriend, but I support this marriage now. It’s so sweet. I also want to be the female warrior protecting Jie Zai!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, forever a god!]
 

 
At the end of the show, the actors opened their eyes simultaneously.
 

 
It felt like waking up from a long dream, still disoriented.
 

 
When Tong Zhao opened her eyes, Duan Ge was still in control of her primary persona. However, the memories of everyone in the drama had not yet returned, so no one knew how they performed or what had happened in the drama. As soon as Tong Zhao stepped out of the cabin, a blonde-haired, round-faced figure and Tang Jingjie rushed over, hugging her from both sides.
 

 
?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Duan Ge was a bit confused and habitually patted their heads, one hand on each: “Be good, be good.”
 

 
“Wuwuwu, I don’t even know why, I just really want to hug you…” Tang Jingjie, being a soft-hearted boy, couldn’t help but blurt out: “I’m doomed, my manager is definitely going to kill me. We won’t be rumored, right? Oh my God, what happened in the drama, I don’t want to let you go…”
 

 
“It’s normal to not want to let go, you should hold on!”
 

 
Anna, who had watched the second half of the drama due to leaving early, was also crying.
 

 
Everyone was quite moved, but Xu Zhu, who had been left aside, awkwardly looked towards the director's team. She guessed that Tong Zhao must have had a particularly tragic end because they were all so upset, and she gave Tong Zhao some comforting words:
 

 
“It’s normal for a post-apocalyptic survival film to be very challenging. It’s okay if you didn’t perform perfectly. Tong Zhao, don’t be too hard on yourself.”
# Chapter22
As soon as she finished speaking, Xu Zhu felt countless gazes turning toward her.
 

 
It was as if she had said something hilariously foolish.
 

 
She wasn’t unfamiliar with this kind of attention.
 

 
Before entering the holographic filming chamber, she had always been the focus of such looks, usually directed at her stepsister.
 

 
Was there a problem with the filming?
 

 
Xu Zhu grew anxious and quickly tried to make amends: “My memory hasn’t fully returned yet. If I said something wrong, I’m sorry. I still hope the filming went well!” She then flashed a compliant smile to everyone.
 

 
She was a bit smarter than her character Feng Sisi, knowing how to shift the narrative.
 

 
After all, they had returned to a peaceful world. Unless faced with life-or-death situations, people’s darker sides are hidden beneath their polished exteriors, and once the lights are on, everyone appears dignified.
 

 
“The filming was very successful. I believe the box office will reach an ideal number!” The director stepped in to smooth things over.
 

 
With the director’s words, the other staff members also gracefully shifted the topic.
 

 
Xu Zhu's intentions for bringing Tong Zhao into the group were not entirely pure, but that was only known to her.
 

 
In the eyes of the director and some core members, Xu Zhu was seen as the final piece of the puzzle for "Countdown 72 Hours," a key contributor to the funding and promotion!
 

 
If she spoke negatively about Tong Zhao here, what would that imply?
 

 
It would imply that she was being modest!
 

 
Before filming, she praised Tong Zhao excessively, boosting their confidence, and after filming, she did not seek credit for herself, truly a generous person.
 

 
Xu Zhu, feeling uneasy, joined the conversation. Due to her blank memory and uncertainty about the developments, she could only engage in conversation with Anna, the third female lead whom she had chatted with pleasantly before filming. However, Anna politely avoided her.
 

 
Since Anna's role was brief and she died early in the story, her in-film memory had already recovered.
 

 
How should one put it?
 

 
Although she knew it was all acting, being used as a scapegoat still wasn’t pleasant.
 

 
Hatred is too strong a word; being close friends is unnecessary.
 

 
If she had this time, why not get to know Miss Tong better?
 

 
Anna, in high spirits, went off to find her Eastern beauty.
 

 
Only the screenwriter walked over, patted Xu Zhu's shoulder, and gave a wry smile: “Xu Zhu, you really caused me a big trouble!”
 

 
His private messages and comments on Weibo had exploded.
 

 
The movie was good, but the key was that it had nothing to do with him; he was just a gatekeeper, with the highlights all coming from the actors themselves. The downside of instinctive films is that they test the editor's ability to create new worlds, and often, the outstanding performance is credited to the actors.
 

 
Especially actors like Tong Zhao, who have a very strong personal presence.
 

 
Oh well!
 

 
He could only think about the bonuses and fame that would come if the movie became a hit.
 

 
The screenwriter’s worried frown was partly genuine, while Xu Zhu, with a pleased expression, apologized to him on behalf of Tong Zhao.
 

 
The two of them comforted each other across channels; although they weren't talking about the same thing, they both had a mutual understanding and unspoken sentiments of regret and happiness.
 

 
After adding a long list of new contacts on WeChat, Tong Zhao was allowed to rest before attending the celebration banquet the next day. According to the stage crew, the unedited and raw footage had already been sent to their personal email, while the polished movie would be available for viewing rights online a week later.
 

 
She took a shower and was about to go to bed when the door was knocked.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit surprised, and even more so when she saw a golden head through the peephole.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Xiao Ge, are you awake?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m here.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Anna came; she’s probably here to find you.]
 

 
Duan Ge responded, and Tong Zhao then handed over the position of the main personality to her.
 

 
At their core, they were the same person and had never competed for the main role.
 

 
Staying in the memory palace to sleep was quite comfortable; as long as "she" was doing well, that was enough.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door to find Anna standing outside with a snow-white pillow, looking quite embarrassed.
 

 
"Is there something you need?" she asked gently.
 

 
"The feeling from the scene hasn’t faded. I keep feeling like zombies might break into my room at any moment. I'm scared alone and can’t sleep by myself..." Anna continued, "Could I sleep with you tonight? I can just sleep on the sofa."
 

 
The actors’ rooms on set were spacious, with a long sofa available for resting.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, "Come in. You can sleep with me."
 

 
Anna tiptoed inside and stole a glance at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Unlike her stylish short hair in the film, Tong Zhao outside of the scene had long, jet-black hair that looked like seaweed. She probably had just showered, as her hair was still damp. Her almond-shaped eyes, black and white under the light, had a poetic and picturesque quality unique to Eastern beauties. Anna stared, fascinated, and asked, "Can I help you dry your hair?"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze slightly, surprised.
 

 
Anna quickly added, "Consider it as a thank you for letting me stay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded with no objection.
 

 
After receiving permission, Anna happily went to get the hair dryer.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat down, and Anna placed her damp hair on her hands. As she dried it, she said enviously, “Your hair quality is really amazing. Do you have any special maintenance tips? I’ve heard that many Chinese actresses drink traditional Chinese medicine to stay looking so young.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pondered for a moment and replied, “Go to bed early, get up early, and exercise more to boost your metabolism.”
 

 
“That’s it?”
 

 
“That’s all.”
 

 
Anna marveled once again at Tong Zhao’s beauty, which seemed to have been kissed by the gods.
 

 
If the so-called "system" claiming to be the main deity can be considered a god, then this statement does hold some truth.
 

 
Once the hair was half-dried, Tong Zhao held Anna’s hand and said, “I plan to watch some of the rough cuts before bed. I’m going to start now; would you like to join me? If not, I’ll just use headphones and watch alone.”
 

 
Anna agreed happily, so the two young women sat side by side on the sofa, turned off the lights, and watched the rough cuts of their own performance.
 

 
In the neighboring room, separated by just a wall, Xu Zhu was doing the same thing.
 

 
The movie started, but Tong Zhao didn’t immediately switch to double speed. Instead, she stayed with Anna, watching the scene where she was dragged off as a substitute. Anna was still deeply affected by this scene, angrily hitting the pillow: “She’s so annoying, just a bitch. I really… I can’t face this face anymore! She only needed to avoid it! I didn’t do anything wrong, and I’m so useful!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Continue.”
 

 
Anna, with a confused look on her freckled face: “Huh?”
 

 
“If you can talk, say more.”
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, the scene switched to where Tong Zhao was pressing Xu Zhu’s head down onto a public restroom floor, making her bow.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t recall this memory at the moment, so she had to replay it repeatedly to savor it.
 

 
Anna, witnessing this personal grudge: “…”
 

 
After that scene passed, Tong Zhao switched to double speed to save time.
 

 
Anna was shocked and asked, “Do you hate her that much?”
 

 
“Not really. Don’t you think this part is quite satisfying?”
 

 
“You switched to double speed right after making her bow…”
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her lips slightly, the blue light from the TV screen casting a cold outline around her: “Don’t you have scenes coming up? Since you want to watch, I won’t fast-forward.”
 

 
With that, she became fully engrossed in the plot.
 

 
Anna, however, couldn’t focus on the screen anymore. Her heart was pounding as she watched Tong Zhao intently. Taking advantage of Tong Zhao’s concentration, she quietly moved closer and snuggled up to her. Tong Zhao didn’t mind at all. Noticing the added weight on her shoulder, she glanced at Anna, assuming the air conditioning was too low and that Anna was cold. She grabbed a thin blanket from beside her and draped it over Anna’s shoulders, pulling it closer around herself as well: “Still cold?”
 

 
……
 

 
The intimidating Eastern beauty knows how to flirt too well!
 

 
Apart from the part where she taught Xu Zhu a lesson, Tong Zhao mainly reviewed the crisis management aspects of the film, identifying many areas for improvement. In case of another apocalypse, she……
 

 
After finishing the sample footage, Duan Ge returned control of the body to Tong Zhao and also triggered two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s passive skill “Best in Show”: Physical fitness greatly enhanced, allowing the host to enjoy the physical strength developed by Duan Ge during the apocalyptic scenarios without any pain.]
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s active skill “Ultimate Moment”: The host can exceed human limits for ten minutes each day, performing theoretically impossible actions.]
 

 
Notably, the system also provided conditions for upgrading the skill.
 

 
For the Empress Shen-related skills, receiving a confession from an S-rank man grants one upgrade opportunity, while confessions from ranks below S (ABC) increase experience points accordingly. What surprised Tong Zhao was that a confession from an E-rank man actually decreases experience points.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Experience points can be deducted?]
 

 
Empress Shen: [It's reasonable. If a low-quality man has the courage to confess to me, it’s a disgrace. You must not have appeared noble or aloof enough; it’s time for reflection.]
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
A woman favored by the emperor indeed has the right to be so demanding.
 

 
In comparison, the conditions for upgrading Duan Ge’s skills are more reasonable and positive.
 

 
Saving a man grants half an upgrade opportunity.
 

 
For women, it grants a full upgrade.
 

 
Female Reporter: [Duan Ge’s true nature confirmed.]
 

 
[It’s not me, I didn’t do it,] Duan Ge denied, scratching her face. [I just care more for women. If women don’t pity women, should we wait for men to save us?]
 

 
Lu Xianchang silently gave a thumbs up.
 

 
Given this trend, Tong Zhao really feared that one day after acting in a fantasy drama, Lu Xianchang’s skill upgrade condition might be to personally eliminate scumbag men—killing one would grant a level-up. But that’s a long way off, so she tried not to think too much about it.
 

 
After the movie ended, Anna was once again moved to tears by the ending.
 

 
Tong Zhao handed her a tissue and acted as a comforting, secure pillow all night until the golden-haired round-face fell asleep in her arms.
 

 
They slept soundly, but someone in the neighboring room couldn’t sleep.
 

 
After watching the sample, Xu Zhu finally understood why the other staff members looked at her oddly.
 

 
It turned out, it wasn’t because Tong Zhao had ruined the performance…
 

 
On the contrary, she had performed exceptionally well.
 

 
It was Xu Zhu who had messed up!
 

 
Xu Zhu twisted her fingers until they were white, too afraid to check Weibo on her phone.
 

 
Her mind was filled with images of Feng Sisi from the movie—
 

 
How could she be like this?
 

 
Recognizing oneself is an eternal challenge in life. Those often called brave might flee when faced with true danger, while the most ordinary and unremarkable individuals might sacrifice themselves to save others during an earthquake... Xu Zhu knew she wasn't particularly kind, but she never imagined she could be so outrageous.
 

 
What puzzled Xu Zhu even more was how she might have messed up, but how could Tong Zhao perform so well?
 

 
Wasn’t she just someone who flattered men?
 

 
It was all Tong Zhao’s fault. If Tong Zhao hadn’t performed so well, Xu Zhu wouldn’t have looked so selfish and conspicuous.
 

 
While Xu Zhu was anxious and confused, a message from a special contact on WeChat arrived:
 

 
Dad: [How was your performance in the first film?]
 

 
Dad: [I have high hopes for you. In my heart, you're actually better than Tong Zhao. Don’t let me down.]
 

 
She had longed for such words for many years.
 

 
At that moment, her heart rate suddenly quickened, and she felt her hands and feet turn cold with panic.
# Chapter23
The bright phone screen hurt Xu Zhu's eyes.
 

 
But she couldn't ignore her father's message, so she hesitantly replied: [It was okay.]
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhenming replied with a voice message.
 

 
“What do you mean by ‘okay’? You are now the rightful young lady of the Tong family, my daughter, and you need to be confident. I don't like the way you speak; you need to change that. Don’t embarrass me and make me regret choosing you.”
 

 
Judging by the slightly tipsy tone, it seemed he had remembered to ask after leaving a drinking session.
 

 
In the dimly lit room, Xu Zhu clutched her phone tightly, her face showing a look of defeat.
 

 
She wanted her father to comfort her…
 

 
Clearly, she had hinted at her unhappiness and was nearly choking up, but what her father cared about was something else—
 

 
He didn’t like her tone and was concerned about her causing him embarrassment.
 

 
If we’re talking about confidence, Tong Zhao certainly had plenty of it.
 

 
Whether at school or at home, even if her father abandoned her, Tong Zhao always appeared as if she were the chosen one, calm and graceful, exuding an air of elegance.
 

 
Xu Zhu, infuriated, threw her phone onto the bed and took out a Polaroid photo from her wallet.
 

 
It was a photo of her and Tong Zhao together.
 

 
Xu Zhu traced over Tong Zhao's face with her glittering nails in the photo, leaving scratches on that impeccably beautiful face. This action somewhat cooled her anger—envy is truly the most burning emotion, and she resented Tong Zhao so much. Tong Zhenming was also a despicable man—didn't she want to have that kind of long-term, ingrained confidence? Why didn’t she? Just because she grew up alongside the Tong family's daughter!?
 

 
If only Tong Zhenming had married her mother back then.
 

 
Why didn’t her mother act sooner?
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched and flattened the photo, feeling heartbroken and on the verge of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao was her obsession.
 

 
Only by defeating her and proving she was better could Xu Zhu hope to resolve this knot.
 

 
---
 

 
After filming *Countdown 72 Hours*, Xu Zhu had to return to shoot the second half of *Star Selection Girls*.
 

 
The girls in the group all knew that Xu Zhu had connections. Except for a few contestants with backgrounds who had some conflicts with her, the other contestants were all polite. The director even arranged a short-haired roommate for Xu Zhu, who was kind and willing to play a supporting role.
 

 
Before Xu Zhu left, she was full of confidence.
 

 
Everyone knew she had film resources even before officially debuting.
 

 
However, upon returning, Xu Zhu was very low-key. Only when her roommate came back from dance practice and found an extra person in the room did she excitedly ask, "Xu Zhu, you finished filming the movie? When can we see it? I will definitely buy a ticket to support you."
 

 
"Yes, it's done," Xu Zhu replied.
 

 
Mentioning the movie made Xu Zhu's eyes redden a bit. "Don't watch it. It feels strange for people I know to see me in a movie."
 

 
She really wished the film would never be released.
 

 
It would be best if it failed to pass review and stayed forever in the vault.
 

 
The short-haired roommate thought Xu Zhu was just being shy and laughed, "I'll buy twenty tickets and invite the whole group to watch. By the way, the team-building event hasn't been decided yet. How about we go to watch your movie together? It sounds like a great idea and would show our team spirit."
 

 
Xu Zhu: "…”
 

 
She knew her roommate was just flattering her.
 

 
After all, this roommate didn’t have any connections, had average popularity, and her only persona was "Xu Zhu's little princess's maid and close friend." She had attracted some fans who liked Yuri through the cute "sisterly" angle, barely surviving each voting period, and was definitely trying to curry favor with Xu Zhu.
 

 
It was awful.
 

 
Xu Zhu couldn’t imagine how the top contestants, who usually didn’t get along with her, would react when they discovered she had messed up the movie. They would likely make a big deal out of it and criticize her.
 

 
According to Murphy’s Law, "the more you fear something, the more likely it is to happen," as soon as Xu Zhu dropped her luggage in the dorm, Gu Yanzhi, who had been in second place in the last voting, pushed open their slightly ajar door. Even before showing her face, her voice was already heard, "Xu Zhu, your sacrifice for this movie is too great!"
 

 
"What sacrifice?"
 

 
Her roommate looked confused.
 

 
Gu Yanzhi grinned and waved her phone, which was playing a scene of Xu Zhu bowing repeatedly, her forehead reddened and eyes full of tears.
 

 
【"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."】
 

 
This short video even had sound, and Gu Yanzhi was laughing so hard she almost cracked.
 

 
It was so satisfying, a really good movie, even better than some indie films.
 

 
Xu Zhu, relying on her wealthy father and connections with the production team, had been flaunting her little princess act. Gu Yanzhi had long been annoyed by her. With both having similar backgrounds and fan popularity, when it was revealed that Xu Zhu landed this movie opportunity, everyone thought Xu Zhu would definitely overshadow her upon returning.
 

 
Who would have thought?
 

 
The little princess was now bowing down.
 

 
Xu Zhu glared at the phone Gu Yanzhi was waving, her face dark with anger, almost wanting to leap forward and tear her face apart.
 

 
But realizing that a physical altercation would not benefit anyone, Xu Zhu chose to hold back, ending this small dispute with her suppressed anger.
 

 
In the instinctive movie, she would explode and turn things around.
 

 
In reality, after weighing the pros and cons, she decided to remember this incident and settle scores with Gu Yanzhi and Tong Zhao later.
 

 
Because of this, Xu Zhu’s performance in the filming of the program significantly declined.
 

 
She couldn’t focus at all.
 

 
Moreover, *Countdown 72 Hours* was broadcast live. Although most viewers chose to wait for reviews and the final cut before watching, evaluations of the film had already leaked, along with some edited short videos:
 

 
The top three most popular clips were:
 

 
1. Feng Sisi drags Anna in to be a scapegoat, then apologizes while being forced to bow her head.
 
2. Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove a bullet from her eyebrow.
 
3. In the final scene, Song Kaiyu, having obtained the crucial antidote, feeds it to his girlfriend and then they fall asleep shoulder to shoulder.
 

 
Except for the third clip, which was marketed by Sister and Tang Jingjie’s companies, the first two clips spread virally on their own, hitting all the high points for netizens—beautiful, powerful, and tragic. The ugly scars left by the bullets on her white thighs were visually striking. Traditionally, such "cutting the bones to remove poison" scenes were privileges reserved for male actors, showcasing their tough-guy image.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was determined to make her mark in the male-dominated field.
 

 
When *Countdown 72 Hours* aired, the character that drew the most attention was the female lead.
 

 
Tong Zhao had such a strong presence that even fans of the male lead had to bow down.
 

 
#FengSisiDoesNotDeserveIt#
 

 
#TouchingChineseSisterFengYanqi#
 

 
#BowDownToTheSister#
 

 
The male lead was originally quite unworthy.
 

 
However, in the end, overcoming his fears fighting alongside the female lead, and saying lines like, "Then let’s die together," which female viewers love, turned around the audience's favor in the final ten minutes. Fans of the mom were comforted and commented: [Jie’s grown up / heart/heart]
 

 
A passerby commented: [Why not call him Jiebao?]
 

 
And this comment received likes well into the next year.
 

 
Tong Zhao's new fans were eager for her work. Unlike the first batch of fans who got into the fandom, they could also explore *The Legend of Emperor Ming*...
 

 
However, they were stunned to see that the role of the ultra-cool "Yanqi" in the first episode of her new work was actually set in a palace intrigue theme.
 

 
How can she do palace intrigue?
 

 
A physics major excelling in palace intrigue?
 

 
It’s truly unfathomable.
 

 
But the numbers are objective. The episodes of *The Legend of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao saw a small spike in sales, and the Empress's dance received renewed attention, especially when combined with Duan Ge’s action scenes…
 

 
You don’t even need to watch the movie; just seeing those three clips and GIFs is enough to understand that the meme has truly gone viral.
 

 
Moreover, these memes have attracted a large number of people to purchase viewing rights. Zombie action movies haven’t been a popular genre in recent years, but due to the crowd mentality, many people watched *Countdown 72 Hours* to avoid missing out, to have something to discuss with friends, and to show off their knowledge on Weibo and Moments, creating a positive cycle of admiration among peers.
 

 
Since the film is available online, with strict copyright control, it effectively curtails the possibility of piracy and avoids the "screening tyranny" of cinemas, which forces viewers to watch poorly reviewed movies due to overbooked schedules. With just a helmet on or lying in a cabin, you can watch any movie you want without interference, even if the cinema's big shots come.
 

 
In this environment, the quality of the film and the effectiveness of its promotion are greatly enhanced.
 

 
Good wine isn’t afraid of deep alleys, but if the aroma is strong enough, even a film that’s just passable can make a decent profit.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* has both of these qualities.
 

 
It’s genuinely exciting and visually appealing, and it has become a hit because of various interesting memes.
 

 
It emerged suddenly, and no film could compete with it.
 

 
Tong Zhao's Weibo follower count skyrocketed, and the number of invitations sent to her agent, Chu Jie, multiplied several times. If the industry had merely extended olive branches to her after she finished *The Legend of Ming Emperor*, after *72 Hours*, she would have been in high demand for variety shows, interviews, and endorsements—everyone was eager for her.
 

 
It can be said that now, as long as she agrees, there are no resources Tong Zhao can't get, except for the top-tier celebrities!
 

 
"Interviews are a given, and now you can finally choose some high-end ads. It was right to turn down that spicy noodle ad before. Now there are offers for watches and perfumes," Chu Jie said happily. "There's also a supplement cover for *YQ*. Although it’s just a supplement, it’s still *YQ*. I've marked it in your schedule; you need to keep those times open."
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded.
 

 
Chu Jie looked up at her: “Are you doing yoga?”
 

 
Tong Zhao answered seriously, “I’m doing yoga while absorbing the essence of the sun and moon.”
 

 
With her foundational training solidified, she no longer needed to sit cross-legged; she could now practice advanced poses, effectively multitasking and achieving more with less effort. However, Chu Jie clearly didn’t quite understand and looked at her with a puzzled expression before continuing, “Then there are variety shows… two guest appearances, one long-term.”
 

 
The variety show invitations were all aimed at her, with both guest appearances related to survival themes.
 

 
One is about surviving on a desert island, and the other is about farming in the countryside.
 

 
The long-term one is interesting—it’s a romance variety show.
 

 
As soon as Empress Chen saw this topic, she couldn't sit still: "Let me have a go; I want to raise fish!"
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately crossed out the farming option. She had never done farming during her quick transmigrations and saw no need to challenge herself in an area she wasn't skilled in. However, the desert island survival show was worth considering.
 

 
As for the romance variety show?
 

 
She glanced at the title: *Beware of the Sea King: Attack with Heart*.
 

 
This peculiar title sounded somewhat familiar; it seemed to have been popular in her previous life.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, “Interesting, let’s go with that one.”
# Chapter24
“Romance variety show?”
 

 
After hearing Tong Zhao's decision, Sister Chu gave her a subtle look, one that seemed to say—
 

 
"Are you trying to pull another stunt?"
 

 
She had the same expression when Tong Zhao wanted to take on a big female lead role in a zombie action film.
 

 
At that time, she had stopped her, but considering the box office success of *Countdown 72 Hours*, her advice lingered on her lips. Instead of directly dissuading her, she said, “The show you’ve chosen is in holographic format, which is similar to shooting a reality film. It will reveal your most authentic side.”
 

 
With current technology, holographic filming can only be done this way.
 

 
Audiences seem to love it.
 

 
It makes sense; people want to see the real side of glamorous stars, and even for ordinary people with no fame, exposing their true nature can be intriguing—whether it’s a seemingly innocent student engaging in shady online activities, a well-educated white-collar worker secretly mistreating stray cats, or a wealthy young man showing his lonely and kind side…
 

 
Whether good or bad, it’s all about satisfying voyeuristic desires.
 

 
The criminal code outlines ways to make big money.
 

 
And industries that cater to human vices often make a substantial profit.
 

 
“Although traditional variety shows have fewer viewers, they are stable and can help establish your existing persona,” Sister Chu said.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
She was confident this variety show would be a hit. Since she had been invited, she didn't want to miss out.
 

 
Perhaps it was a habit from her experiences in the quick-wear world of completing tasks and missions, Tong Zhao found it hard to relax. She was always purposeful, and if she stopped for a moment, she began to feel anxious, eager to keep working. High productivity was a source of her security; not advancing meant falling behind, and she wouldn’t let an opportunity slip by.
 

 
However, she needed a good reason to reassure her manager.
 

 
“I also want to experience a sweet, innocent romance in a variety show.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
As she spoke, her aura seemed to radiate an otherworldly charm, as if every word she said was profound wisdom.
 

 
“Are you sure?”
 

 
Sister Chu gave her a sidelong glance and flipped over the proposal for the romance variety show to show her the content summary.
 

 
“Beware of the Heartbreaker: Conquering the Heart”
 

 
“Six single men and women will live under the same roof. They will forget their real-life identities and receive a new identity card, along with different tasks, and must find a way to earn living expenses. Each person has one opportunity to confess their feelings. Will you find true love, or will you be just another fish in someone else's pond? Be careful, as there are two heartbreakers among the six, with impure motives aiming to set your heart on fire.”
 

 
...
 

 
Sweet, innocent romance.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit pained, but she was certain Empress Shen would love this concept.
 

 
Without missing a beat, she said, “I’m sure. It’s perfect for me as if it was tailor-made for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was confident. Even if she didn't draw the heartbreaker card, she had the ability to make any heartbreaker release all the fish in their pond and love only her. After all, how could a mere heartbreaker compare to an emperor with three thousand beauties? An emperor doesn’t just have a pond but the entire Pacific Ocean and he alone favors her, a beautiful mermaid.
 

 
Sister Chu studied her for a moment, then nodded without further discussion. “Alright, I’ll clear your schedule.”
 

 
She made a few notes on the calendar. “You’ll need to film a promotional video before entering the cabin, and the identity cards will be drawn before filming starts.”
 

 
That was good.
 

 
If a more suitable personality emerged, it could be swapped in advance.
 

 
“Is there a script?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
“Reality variety shows only have guiding plots, not the kind of script you’re imagining for traditional variety shows.”
 

 
“Oh, and at the beginning of next month, you and a few other leads from ‘72 Hours’ need to appear on a show for promotion. You’ll need to keep that day free…”
 

 
“How long will ‘Survivor Island’ take to film? If it’s less than three days, I’d like to join,” she said, recalling what Duan Ge mentioned.
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
After some back-and-forth, Tong Zhao’s electronic calendar was filled to the brim with appointments.
 

 
*
 

 
After finishing ‘72 Hours,’ Tong Zhao enjoyed a valuable week off.
 

 
She had slept all day in the apartment, spent the entire next day dealing with personal matters at her computer, and was woken up on the third day by the doorbell.
 

 
Expecting it to be some kind of sales visit, she peered through the peephole and saw a familiar brown-dyed head—the long-lost Wei Dasha.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door, a bit surprised. “A rare visitor.”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t come empty-handed; he carried two large bags full of items and, without hesitation, took off his shoes and walked in. The bags were filled with daily necessities, and soon enough, he had packed her refrigerator and bathroom cabinet. Tong Zhao was even more surprised. “So, you’ve finally decided to give up on inheriting the family business to become a civil servant, and you’re practicing precise poverty alleviation at my place?”
 

 
“Poverty alleviation my foot, I’m just worried you might starve at home.”
 

 
Wei Zekai had seen her perform on stage with Xu Zhu and, concerned that she might be feeling down, found an excuse to check on her.
 

 
Seeing that she was doing well, he felt relieved and started paying attention to some trivial matters. “By the way, can you perform that thing again?”
 

 
“What thing?”
 

 
“You know,” Wei Zekai gestured on his thigh, “the one with the bullet.”
 

 
Tong Zhao forced a smile. "I could use your head to demonstrate bowing."
 

 
"Ugh."
 

 
Although he knew it was impossible, Wei Zekai still sighed deeply with regret.
 

 
Tong Zhao rummaged through the snacks he hadn’t put in the refrigerator and found three large packs of premium cigarettes, clearly expensive. She was speechless. "Why did you buy me cigarettes? When have you ever seen me smoke?"
 

 
"You smoked in the movie."
 

 
Wei Zekai gave her a sidelong glance.
 

 
The rebellious young man’s usually cool and arrogant face was now full of melancholy.
 

 
Tong Zhao, even if slow on the uptake, understood. She slammed the table. "Do you really like the character Feng Yanqi I played?"
 

 
Wei Zekai extended his face. "It’s somewhat interesting."
 

 
"So you do like it."
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, unpacked the cigarettes and lighter he gave her, and, like in the movie, flicked the lighter with a flourish before lighting the cigarette. She held it between her fingers and gave him a smile that was very much in the style of "Duan Ge," making this arrogant young master freeze in place. Before he could react, she extinguished the cigarette. "How’s that? I’ve even done a special performance just for you.”
 

 
... So cool!
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure. "It is somewhat interesting."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled, then remembered something important.
 

 
"Wen Kai and the others mentioned wanting to invest in the film industry before, right? It definitely has potential, but I think their vision is still a bit narrow. Relying solely on your pocket money and my current salary won’t be enough."
 

 
The film industry is an expensive endeavor, and even the Tong family might struggle with it.
 

 
The Wei family, however, could handle it.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reputation was a concern. As far as Tong Zhao knew, his most profitable investments were those where he did nothing at all. During periods when he followed motivational posts on WeChat and Zhihu about starting businesses, he ended up losing a lot of money.
 

 
This led his well-meaning friends to secretly feed him the toxic message, "Effort doesn’t guarantee success, but not trying is definitely comfortable," to prevent him from wasting more money.
 

 
The Wei family no longer dared to let him play around and planned to find someone else to manage the group in the future, turning Wei Zekai into a figurehead. They hoped he would quickly settle down, start a family, and have a grandchild with some investment sense, or even a granddaughter would do.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai had already given up on starting a business, his legendary status still persisted in the world.
 

 
A legendary status earned for nothing.
 

 
But Tong Zhao remembered that, in her previous life, Wei Zekai had initially failed many times before learning from his mistakes and improving.
 

 
But now, no one believes he can succeed.
 

 
"I'll find a way to get some money from home," Wei Zekai pondered, causing his family’s elder to have a headache. "Should I go back and tell them I'll castrate myself if they don’t give me a billion?"
 

 
"If you say anything more, I might not be able to stop myself from stepping in," Tong Zhao shot him a look. "I want to pool the money and give you some investment advice, as long as you trust my judgment."
 

 
Firstly, she has a few years' worth of advanced knowledge about which companies and stocks will rise.
 

 
Secondly, her experiences in the modern world of quick-wear have also given her some insights into investing.
 

 
What she lacks is the capital.
 

 
She also wants to create a business circle where she holds the leading position, a circle that Xu Zhu and the Tong family have no right to touch.
 

 
Not only does she want to act, but she also wants to surpass Tong Zhenming in his most proud field.
 

 
"Actually, even if you hadn’t come to me, I was planning to invite you out to discuss something serious," Tong Zhao said, walking over to the top of the cluttered cabinet with her long legs. She placed a document, which had been weighed down by a mooncake tin, in front of Wei Zekai. The faint smell of smoke still lingered in the air, adding a touch of business atmosphere to the otherwise casual setting. As Wei Zekai looked at her, he almost saw through her and glimpsed the highly confident female lead from *Countdown 72 Hours*.
 

 
“Duan Ge” is just one of Tong Zhao's personas in the world; she is still herself.
 

 
"Here are seven investment opportunities I’m very optimistic about. You can review the details. They’ll use up more than a year's worth of your pocket money, including my acting fees. You can take them back to consult a lawyer and see if there’s anyone else who wants to join us."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused and gave him a teasing smile:
 

 
"Mr. Wei, are you willing to go bankrupt with me again?"
 

 
Her young and beautiful face radiated with vibrant ambition, burning into Wei Zekai's retina.
 

 
After understanding her words, Wei Zekai's heart raced.
 

 
He was moved.
 

 
Not in a romantic sense.
 

 
Why do rich second-generation heirs repeatedly fall for investment and entrepreneurship scams? It’s clear they could easily live a comfortable life just by collecting dividends and rent. The desire to prove oneself in youth often outweighs everything else. Everyone thinks Wei Zekai lacks the ability to start a business and the vision for investment…
 

 
But Tong Zhao was telling him to try again.
 

 
"Alright, I’ll go back and take a look,”
 

 
Wei Zekai made an effort to keep his voice calm, but he was insistent: "From now on, as long as you have a film you're working on, my family will invest in it."
 

 
He was eager to support his good friend in this way.
 

 
He wanted to tie his investment directly to the films she made.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded without hesitation and smiled at him again.
 

 
The news about Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao working together spread quickly among the second-generation circles. Those who were friendly with Wei Zekai found it amusing and interesting, so without much hesitation, they joined the investment venture, forming an investment interest group. An unnamed friend even humorously renamed the group to:
 

 
【Mr. Wei’s Charity Foundation】
 

 
No one had much faith in this venture set up by the second-generation heirs playing around.
 

 
The most skeptical was Ning Zhiyi, who had just started dealing with the business in his own company.
 

 
He thought Tong Zhao must be crazy to be interested in Wei Zekai. Others also couldn’t understand why they would get involved, so he advised the more diligent and well-behaved second-generation heirs to stay away from this group that seemed like throwing money into the sea. His advice had some effect, as many cautious second-generation heirs turned down Wei Zekai’s invitation.
# Chapter25
Ning Zhiyi didn't feel at all that he was cutting off someone's financial path.
 

 
He thought he was actually doing a good deed, accumulating merit.
 

 
And it was for Tong Zhao's benefit.
 

 
If Tong Zhao collaborated with Wei Zekai and a bunch of second-generation heirs lost money, even if they had agreed in advance that the investment could result in a loss, how could they not hold a grudge against her? He didn’t want to see her offend so many people. Not only did he advise others not to invest, but he also called Tong Zhao to persuade her to reconsider.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi cautiously asked, “Are you really going to invest with Wei Zekai?”
 

 
“Yes, is there a problem?”
 

 
Tong Zhao responded coldly.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi frowned and tried to give good advice, saying many heartfelt words. As the conversation went on, he drifted further: “You’re a girl, you shouldn’t mix with Wei Zekai and his crowd. I heard you even invested your own film earnings? They’re all only children in their families; no matter how they waste money, there’s always someone to cover it. Now that Uncle Tong is old and has a child, and you’ve fallen out with him, you need to think about your own future…”
 

 
“I’m investing for my own benefit,” Tong Zhao interrupted him. “I know you’re advising people you know not to invest.”
 

 
Caught off guard by her directness, Ning Zhiyi awkwardly fell silent for three seconds. “I’m just worried about you.”
 

 
“Worried about me? That’s a bit amusing. But I don’t mind your little maneuvers behind my back. I’m not planning to bring too many people into this. I just want to let you know that since you’ve chosen your side, there’s no need to contact me again. I’m not interested in being friends with Xu Zhu’s boyfriend.”
 

 
In a flash, Ning Zhiyi thought he had grasped the issue.
 

 
He softened his tone, “Are you jealous of Xu Zhu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily at a loss for words.
 

 
Duan Ge was quite displeased: “I’d rather eat raw than be jealous of Xu Zhu. What a joke.”
 

 
Empress Chen: “Help, does he think Zhao Zhao likes him? I’m offended; it’s disgusting.”
 

 
She pulled at the corners of her mouth, remaining calm. She smiled and said, “Why is it that you’re so confident when you’re even less appealing than Wei Zekai? Goodbye, don’t bother me again.”
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao ended the call.
 

 
When Ning Zhiyi tried calling again, the line was already disconnected.
 

 
“What do you mean that even Wei Zekai is better?”
 

 
Wei Zekai himself felt somewhat offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned off the speakerphone and looked at the group of friends gathered in her apartment. Five young men and women had crowded the already small room to the point where there was barely space to move. These pampered young masters and mistresses didn’t seem to care at all. They brought their own drinks and junk food, and were huddled together munching on McDonald's.
 

 
When she turned back, she saw Wei Zekai with a whole chicken wing hanging from his mouth.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite good-looking, but his nutritional supply seemed uneven. He must have lacked a crucial bit of brain function, as there was a glob of ketchup smeared on his straight nose, though it was unclear how it got there—truly a unique character.
 

 
This was the final small group willing to invest and make money with Wei Zekai and her.
 

 
The group consisted of only seven people in total, with clear roles of president and vice president.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the president, and everyone gave him the nickname "Philanthropic Gambler.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was the vice president, not because the others thought she was inferior to Wei Zekai, but because she was responsible for stopping the president from turning investment into charity.
 

 
The second-generation rich were not merely ignorant. They had received high-quality education and understood business and investment knowledge better than children from ordinary families. They could deduce why a business would succeed based on results, but when it came to starting a business from scratch and making money...
 

 
They were at a loss.
 

 
Originally, everyone thought this was just a new kind of social gathering for eating, drinking, and spending money, with the chance to get to know the hot and popular Tong Zhao and take some pictures to show off on social media. However, after sitting down and listening to Tong Zhao’s series of personal speeches...
 

 
They realized how knowledgeable Tong Zhao was.
 

 
The more they listened, the more they realized.
 

 
It seemed like it really had potential!
 

 
In the past, Tong Zhao had managed to gather a group of followers during the apocalypse. Now, in peacetime, persuading others to make money with her was not difficult, especially when dealing with pampered young masters and mistresses who had never experienced significant hardships.
 

 
By the end of the afternoon, they were convinced that listening to Tong Zhao would eventually lead to big profits.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she weren’t acting, she might have become a successful pyramid scheme leader and made a fortune.
 

 
“Ning Zhiyi thinks I like him,” Tong Zhao said casually.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Ning Zhiyi really has too high an opinion of himself. I can’t wait to see his reaction when he finds out we’ve made money.”
 

 
Second-Generation B handed Wei Zekai a tissue to wipe the ketchup from his nose: “Don’t even mention it. My brother was on good terms with him. I had persuaded my brother to join, but after Ning Zhiyi talked him out of it, he stood me up today. It’s so annoying.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the shabby room, a group of not-so-promising young rakes had gathered.
 

 
The high-quality cigarettes that Wei Zekai had bought for Tong Zhao were also divided among them.
 

 
To be honest, Tong Zhao thought they were a bunch of simpletons.
 

 
But what did it matter if they were simpletons? Just like in many stories where the protagonist enjoys being favored by a group, the most important thing in life is to be on the right team.
 

 
And the biggest advantage of these simpletons was that they had chosen her.
 

 
Simpleton C: “Strategist, I want to take a photo with you!”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her chin: “Alright, come over.”
 

 
*
 

 
After finalizing the investment plans, Tong Zhao went to participate in the promotional program for “Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
Since it was Duan Ge's performance, she also took charge of this interview, gladly taking a break.
 

 
The interview included some common mini-games, and the content of the games was directly taken from the film. Tong Zhao sat in the makeup room, having her makeup touched up by the artist while flipping through the script, worried that the director might ask her to perform a demonstration of her marksmanship.
 

 
In the end, the program team asked her to perform some shooting skills on stage.
 

 
They used a temporary shooting range, originally intended to show the audience the difference between reality and holographic filming, emphasizing that being a cool sharpshooter isn't as easy as it seems. However...
 

 
Holding a real gun similar to the one used in the film, Tong Zhao wore safety goggles and earmuffs.
 

 
She was dressed in a bright red cocktail dress with high heels, a stark contrast to her more neutral, professional attire in the film. Yet, after pulling the trigger and achieving a score of 200 hits from 20 shots, no one could see her as just a pretty face.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Despite her beautiful appearance, she was remarkably formidable.
 

 
Duan Ge: [Is this all you wanted me to do?]
 

 
Duan Ge curled her lips with a hint of disdain.
 

 
That smug, over-the-top smile was captured in a close-up by the production team, adding an extra layer of shine to her fierce persona.
 

 
Anna and Tang Jingjie clapped excitedly, letting the audience know that the lead actor had good chemistry.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu stared blankly at her step-sister.
 

 
There was no venomous jealousy to prompt netizens to write more negative commentary. However, her dazed and out-of-sorts appearance meant she couldn’t grab any camera time or opportunities to shine. All the spotlight went to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When did the step-sister learn to shoot?
 

 
Xu Zhu was a bit unsettled.
 

 
But it wasn’t surprising; wealthy children often learn a wide range of things—piano, flower arranging, skiing, extreme sports. There are plenty of extravagant ways to spend money.
 

 
During the interview, Tong Zhao was specifically asked a few questions that netizens were curious about.
 

 
“Your two characters are quite different, but since it’s a primal instinct film, which one do you think is closer to the real you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Feng Yanqi. I am very ambitious; the Empress often has to act against her will.”
 

 
Against her will.
 

 
Seeing this interview, Ming Emperor Song Wanzhuo felt as if he had experienced heartbreak all over again.
 

 
When the topic of "acting against one's will" came up, her tone suddenly softened, likely due to thoughts of the Empress.
 

 
The male host grinned mischievously and said, “So, among the ‘Zhao Jie CP’ with Tang Jingjie, it seems the female lead’s name is ranked first this year. I heard this is... implying the dominant role, right?”
 

 
The female host nodded knowingly.
 

 
Tang Jingjie’s face flushed red.
 

 
“It’s normal,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, not at all shy about the scandal, turned to smile at Tang Jingjie and reached out to drape her arm over his shoulder. “When I stand next to him, the roles of dominant and submissive are quite clear, right?”
 

 
As soon as the answer was given, the studio erupted in laughter without needing any cues from the stage crew.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, covering his face in resignation, said, “I wish I were half as handsome as Sister Zhao.”
 

 
The host responded, “It’s okay, the fans just love your cuteness.”
 

 
Tong Zhao and Tang Jingjie’s CP was essentially a pairing that happened halfway through, without much fanfare.
 

 
The buzz around Ming Emperor X Empress is far behind.
 

 
It’s clear that the dominant-male, submissive-female dynamic is mainstream.
 

 
However, this does not affect Tong Zhao's fan base.
 

 
On the contrary, most of her followers are career-oriented fans who do not want her to be involved in romance or interact with male celebrities. They prefer her to remain independent and exclusive.
 

 
After this episode aired, the video of Tong Zhao using a real gun again topped the trending searches.
 

 
Before it even fell off the trending list, she moved on to filming the promotional video for *Be Careful, Sea King*, where she met the five people who would live with her in the holographic world for a month.
 

 
Reality shows in this format emphasize authenticity, so not all participants are celebrities.
 

 
Many are influencers or just ordinary people.
 

 
The only common trait they share is that they all look quite good.
 

 
However...
 

 
After greeting the director, Tong Zhao walked over to a man with dyed golden-brown hair and tapped Male Contestant Number One on the shoulder:
 

 
“Charity Gambling King, explain why you are here.”
 

 
“Call me Mingzun,”
 

 
Today, Young Master Wei was wearing a shorter black shirt, and when he lifted his arm, the tattoo on his abs was visible, making Tong Zhao think he might need an extra layer; “Didn’t I say? I invest in any show you’re involved in. The director thought I had a talent for acting and invited me to join. Everything’s all set, and I’m free!”
 

 
He seemed quite excited: “Let me tell you, this show is the first time our Mingzun and Anzun are collaborating, and we absolutely can’t mess it up.”
 

 
From Wei Zekai’s brief explanation, strategist Tong Zhao had already deduced the truth.
 

 
The director must have seen Wei Zekai’s good looks and wealthy background, figuring he’d be a great addition to the show and persuaded him to join.
 

 
“Wei Zekai,”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him thoughtfully: “Do you know this isn’t a movie shoot? You’re here to find romance.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...What?”
# Chapter26
Tong Zhao spent five minutes explaining what a dating reality show is.
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned.
 

 
He pointed to himself and asked, "Is it real dating? Not acting?"
 

 
Well, it's not really real dating.
 

 
The scheming of people's hearts in a reality show is different from reality. However, quite a few who pair up on the show end up seeing each other as soulmates afterward because they've seen the truest side of each other's souls. "This show has a storyline and background setting. In a bit, we'll draw identity cards. Who knows, you might go from being a rich second-generation heir to a pauper."
 

 
"It doesn't matter."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed quite confident.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought it made sense, after all, he was a handsome guy, and there were always a lot of girls who liked him back in school.
 

 
But it turned out his confidence came from something else: "I am spiritually rich, and I have personal charisma."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him but didn't see any sign of spiritual richness.
 

 
Just as she was about to ruffle his golden-brown hair, she saw a man with a strong, chiseled face, dressed in a casual suit, walking over and greeting the two of them, "Hello, I am Contestant No. 2, He Shun." He pointed to the small square name tag on his chest and smiled at Tong Zhao. "I’m your fan. May I shake your hand?"
 

 
Tong Zhao politely shook his hand.
 

 
Although he claimed to be her fan, He Shun remained very restrained and didn't take advantage of the situation. Maybe it was because the cameras were rolling. "I’m the boss of Feiteng Capital, so you could say I'm a somewhat well-known investor. But recently, my sharpest investment was still on the first episode of 'The Legend of Emperor Ming' when you appeared. Really, I knew you had potential from the very first episode."
 

 
He looked down at Tong Zhao, his eyes burning with intensity.
 

 
It was the kind of gaze a man has when he sees someone he is attracted to.
 

 
Off to the side, Wei Zekai’s internal alarm bells went off, and he quickly cut in to introduce himself: "My surname is Wei, Wei Zekai. I mainly focus on charity... no, I mean, investment as well. I’ve been investing in Tong Zhao since a long time ago. Back in elementary school, when she played the lead role in a play, I cast my vote for her as the Best Young Actress."
 

 
Tong Zhao was his only successful project to date.
 

 
The more popular Tong Zhao became, the more it proved that Wei Zekai had a good eye for investments.
 

 
Damn old man, he also wants to compete with him for the position of the first investor!
 

 
"......"
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit too embarrassed to watch.
 

 
Just then, the host called for everyone to gather and draw cards, so the three of them stopped talking and headed to the center of the room.
 

 
The walls of this room were painted pink, with red balloons and ribbons everywhere. The lighting created a shimmering visual effect, making the setup look like a proposal scene.
 

 
"Let me reintroduce our show."
 

 
"The official name is *Beware of the Sea King*, but it can also be called *Sea King Killer*."
 

 
In front of the host was a box, with a stack of demonstration cards next to it.
 

 
He held up a card featuring a person in black clothing wearing a dog mask: “This is the Judge. While enjoying the process of dating, whoever draws this card has the responsibility to identify the 'Sea King' hiding among you and expose the true nature of the players who are insincere in love! The Judge has a mysterious special ability, which only the player who draws this card will know about. For now, let’s keep it a secret.”
 

 
[Judge]
 

 
The second and third cards the host raised happened to be a pair of elegantly dressed man and woman standing back to back.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
"For the players who draw the Sea King card, your task is to make everyone fall in love with you within the given time and collect declarations of true love from all participants."
 

 
"Note that among you six players, there will be one male Sea King and one female Sea King. Our show is very gender-equal; no matter whether you’re a man or a woman, everyone has a chance to experience the hardships of love."
 

 
"And regardless of whether you are a Sea King, Judge, or a regular player, there is a ‘True Love’ app on your phone. This is the app you will use to express your feelings. Its function is quite simple."
 

 
The host opened an app with a pink heart icon on their phone: "You can use it to send messages to other players, and you can also enter the name of the player you have feelings for.”
 

 
A huge peach-pink heart appeared, with a space in the middle where you could indeed enter a name.
 

 
Romantic music started playing at just the right moment—
 

 
"I have never been so certain, so sure, about who would be my destiny..."
 

 
"Please remember, once you enter a player's name, it cannot be changed."
 

 
"Until your halo descends into my dark night..."
 

 
A delicate-looking girl with glasses timidly raised her hand, "What if we realize the person is a Sea King after entering their name?"
 

 
The music stopped abruptly.
 

 
The host smiled slightly.
 

 
This smile was a bit different; it clashed slightly with the warm and sweet atmosphere of the setup:
 

 
"Then you still can't change it. After all, in reality, even if most of us find out our partners are jerks, it's hard to let them go."
 

 
The girl with glasses pressed her lips together, her eyes turning red; she was also a player with a story.
 

 
"The condition for the commoners to win is to mutually become each other's true love."
 

 
"For the Sea King, the goal is to make everyone fall in love with them."
 

 
"Note that if a player doesn't feel moved or fall for anyone, and safely makes it through the entire show, they can win a cash prize and earn the title of [Solitary King]!"
 

 
Before drawing the cards, everyone had to introduce themselves. The girl with glasses was named Zhong Muxi. She said she no longer trusted men after being hurt by a jerk and didn't need love anymore, claiming she would definitely not fall for the Sea King's tricks: "On this show, not falling in love is the rule for winning, so as long as I don't draw the Sea King card, I'm confident I'll get the Solitary King's prize."
 

 
The crowd generously applauded her.
 

 
Concubine Chen was unimpressed: "The more someone claims they’ll never love again, the harder they usually fall the next time. Love and men are both wonderful things; it’s just that her experience with one was bad. Someone in their early twenties saying such naive things is likely to be deceived again."
 

 
The female reporter laughed: "I suspect you’re talking about Master Lu Xian and even have evidence to prove it."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "Let’s all chant together like Master Lu Xian: 'Solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary.'"
 

 
It was Wei Zekai's turn. He swaggered up to draw a card, only to have his hand held back by the host, who told him he needed to introduce himself first.
 

 
Young Master Wei was a bit stunned. Wherever he went before, everyone already knew who he was.
 

 
But in the entertainment industry, he was a nobody.
 

 
The male guests all seemed to want to showcase themselves, especially He Shun, who earlier had an impressive self-introduction, boasting his title as an investor and sharing his shining success stories. However, Tong Zhao knew that, at present, Wei Zekai was just a student taking online courses, not good at anything, and best known for losing money.
 

 
Sure enough, he said, "I’m Wei Zekai, born into the wealthy second-generation by talent, currently a university student, and planning to transition into an investor in the future."
 

 
Amid the uproarious laughter, Tong Zhao really wanted to turn her face away and not look at this fool.
 

 
However, the female guest Chang Xiaonian, who had previously said she’d never been in a relationship, was staring at him with bright eyes, as if she genuinely saw his spiritual richness and extraordinary personal charm.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to go up, the finale.
 

 
"Do I also have to introduce myself?”
 

 
She was the only celebrity among them, and the host smiled and nodded.
 

 
Tong Zhao naturally showcased herself in front of the camera, her flawless beauty radiating a confident ease. As she casually glanced around, her dazzling presence captivated everyone, leaving both men and women momentarily stunned. "I’m Tong Zhao, a newcomer in Instinct Films. Fans on Weibo often say they’re curious about what I’d be like in a relationship. Since dating in real life isn’t possible, I’ve come on this show to have some fun."
 

 
The host seized the opportunity to ask curiously, "Why can't you date in real life? Does your manager not allow it?"
 

 
"No time."
 

 
Tong Zhao spread her hands in a helpless gesture.
 

 
It’s partly because she’s busy, and partly because it’s hard to please everyone.
 

 
Although each persona is still her, just as a woman's preferences in partners can change throughout her life, each of her different personas has its own slight preferences. Then there’s Han Zhi, who she can't quite figure out if he likes men or women.
 

 
So, until she meets a man who can accept her fully...
 

 
Forget it, no need to trouble anyone.
 

 
Finally, the host let her draw a card.
 

 
Everyone would draw two cards: one for their apparent role setting and one for their special identity card.
 

 
The two cards Tong Zhao drew were...
 

 
[Student]
 

 
Message: With zero dating experience, only by studying hard can you earn life points.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
Message: A great beauty wants to keep multiple suitors—there’s no one you can’t take away.
 

 
After reading the contents of the cards, Tong Zhao put them away without a hint of emotion on her face. She could feel that she was the focus of everyone’s gaze, with each person observing her expression for clues. Since this was just a warm-up promo, lingering too long wouldn’t be good, so after everyone had drawn their cards, the host announced that the filming for the day was over.
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly came over and whispered, "I drew a super awesome identity, but I won’t tell you now!"
 

 
"Even if you told me, you’d forget such key information after entering the reality show," she replied.
 

 
Tong Zhao waved goodbye to the host, director, and crew.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, "Shall I give you a ride back? Today, I’m driving a green car—it goes perfectly with my outfit today."
 

 
Young Master Wei's level of material wealth was just that ridiculous.
 

 
While an average rich second-generation might choose a car based on their mood, he had the same model in every color, just to match his daily outfits.
 

 
"Sister Chu assigned me an assistant and a driver, so I don't need a ride."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
The two walked side by side to the underground parking lot. Young Master Wei glanced in the direction Tong Zhao indicated and spotted a dull gray nanny van, showing a look of barely concealed disdain.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew he was about to give his "high opinions" again, so she reminded him, "Keep it high EQ."
 

 
"This car of yours..."
 

 
Wei Zekai managed to squeeze out a compliment: "It’s pretty safe. Just looking at it, you can tell it won’t get hijacked."

The preview video of this reality show aired, and it unexpectedly received a good response.
 

 
Tong Zhao was recently in the spotlight, and netizens were very curious about her. She was a treasure yet to be fully discovered, especially since she was appearing on a reality show that couldn’t hide one's true nature... It was quite bold, and netizens' prying curiosity reached new heights, with discussions on major forums and websites fervently rising:
 

 
“Anyone who has seen *Countdown* knows Tong Zhao is set to be the Solitary Queen. She’s stunning on her own and doesn’t need a man.”
 

 
“Waiting to see Concubine Chen slay the entire scene. Is there really a man who can escape the Empress's grasp?”
 

 
“The wealthy second-generation is hilarious! Seems like he already knows Tong Zhao? Could he be her boyfriend outside the industry?”
 

 
Opinions on Tong Zhao among drama fans were as polarized as a diode.
 

 
Those from *The Legend of Emperor Ming* thought she was the Sea King.
 

 
Those who got into the fandom from *Countdown* felt she didn’t need a man at all and seemed like a tough, ironclad woman.
 

 
Controversy breeds heat, and the director felt his decision to involve Wei Zekai was absolutely correct. This handsome and charismatic young man was a natural focal point. Netizens quickly dug up his Weibo, Instagram, and even his gaming affiliations, discovering that he was a genuine wealthy second-generation heir, but…
 

 
"The second-generation heir photo dug up from Wei Zekai's Weibo—The question is, whose old, shabby background is that?"
 

 
This post generated a lot of discussion and went viral that afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked.
 

 
His first thought wasn’t about his privacy being violated.
 

 
He sent two WeChat messages to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I told you the place you rented couldn't be lived in!"
 

 
"It seems this generation of netizens isn't very emotionally intelligent either!"
# Chapter27
The manager also sent Tong Zhao the related news.
 

 
Since Wei Zekai's Weibo post caused a stir, the subsequent reactions included sharp-eyed netizens discovering that Tong Zhao and that group of rich second-generation heirs were all mutual followers on Weibo. Furthermore, in that group photo, she was definitely in the center position, not looking like a small star being casually played with by the second-generation heirs, but rather like a close friend.
 

 
[Hasn't anyone dug up Tong Zhao's background yet?]
 

 
[A post from her middle school classmate on the eighth forum group says her family is very wealthy and that she's in the same circle as these second-generation heirs.]
 

 
[Wealthy but living in an old, shabby place? The nanny car Tong Zhao uses is also quite low-end.] (Wei Zekai secretly liked this post)
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn't want to give his eldest daughter a "white and rich" image, so he naturally wouldn't admit it directly, and Xu Zhu felt the same way.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao perfectly agreed with them on this.
 

 
Who would care about being the Tong family’s daughter?
 

 
If it weren’t for the fact that her mother’s last name was Tong, she would have changed her surname before debuting.
 

 
As a result, the real information was ignored, while the false information was spread convincingly—
 

 
It was said that Tong Zhao came from a grassroots background, which was why she had a tough and resilient subconscious.
 

 
Which rich young lady hasn’t been pampered and cherished growing up? Who could have the courage to face challenges without any help?
 

 
“Is Wei Zekai your boyfriend? It’s fine if you're really in love, and you two do seem to match. Just remember not to let your manager be the last person to know about your relationship.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked.
 

 
“It’s not true. I’ll have him clarify…”
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao thought she might have a chance to fight back, she realized that she and Wei Zekai would soon be filming a dating reality show together. Given her identity card, she would definitely have to flirt with Wei, and anything could happen. She decided to stop talking: “In any case, we’re not dating. If we were, would I still be living in that small apartment? I’d have to respond, right? As if nothing happened?”
 

 
Sister Chu said it was fine since she had her own work.
 

 
In the era of Instinct Films, the moral standards for "actors" had dropped to a new low.
 

 
After all, it’s instinctual; anything can happen in a show.
 

 
For example, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, once faced widespread online criticism but didn’t lose all her opportunities. On the contrary, her deeply selfish portrayal attracted a group of self-interested fans and offered more negative roles.
 

 
As long as the “true self” has character and charm, it can keep attracting attention over time.
 

 
“Alright.”
 

 
Tong Zhao decided not to respond publicly and also instructed her team to stay silent.
 

 
Once the investment results come through, the rumors will naturally die down.
 

 
Her team liked this feeling of holding back their big move and agreed unanimously with Tong Zhao’s request to ignore the netizens' speculations about their relationship. Thus, the public perception of Tong Zhao settled into the image of a “grassroots girl who gets along well with the second-generation heirs.”
 

 
The controversy over the group photo cooled down significantly after that.
 

 
Just because of that photo, Tong Zhao's residence was dug up by keen-eyed netizens, and that very day, some fans showed up at her door asking for autographs. Feeling helpless, she had to borrow some money from Wei Zekai and move to a community with better security—
 

 
Given her current level of fame, she indeed couldn’t afford to live in a poor place any longer.
 

 
Wei Zekai, knowing he was in the wrong, personally drove her to the move.
 

 
Seeing her furniture nearly deforming his sports car, Tong Zhao sighed with a tinge of discomfort.
 

 
"I spent more on moving company services than you’d spend fixing this car," she remarked.
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t pleased with this comment.
 

 
He thought his driving skills were a hundred thousand times better than those of the moving company: "I can reach your new home in ten minutes; this car goes from 0 to 100 in just 2.9 seconds..."
 

 
"City speed limits, thank you."
 

 
※
 

 
Once the moving ordeal was over, the day for filming *Sea King Killer* arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The director added all the cast members to a WeChat group so they could get to know each other in advance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t check the conversations in the group, and Wei Zekai had directly muted them.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, enthusiastically added her as a friend. Since she needed to interact with him for work, she accepted the request and took the opportunity to learn more about her potential target— the female Sea King corresponds to all the male players. She asked Concubine Chen to also check out his social media.
 

 
He Shun’s social media was very glamorous and filled with the aura of successful individuals.
 

 
“The appreciation of RMB is the most important factor in offshore RMB liquidity expectations...”
 

 
“Next week, I will be giving a lecture at K University as an alumnus...”
 

 
“Self-discipline is a prerequisite for success [Fist][Fist]”
 

 
“Appropriate rest is also important! [Attached a filtered snapshot of first-class cabin with a Mac]”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “What a boring man. If His Majesty posted something like, ‘Have you seen the Golden Hall at 4 a.m.? Do you know how hard I work?’ I would vomit.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: “Haven’t we seen him in person? Let’s analyze based on his social media.”
 

 
Concubine Chen, having the leisure to indulge her, responded: “He probably doesn’t listen to others. His politeness in front of women is just an act. Once someone is out of his control, his true nature will show. However, if you go along with his temperament, you’ll quickly fall under his spell.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed; he was indeed the type she had no interest in.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, had a lot of interest in her and invited her twice, but she had to refuse due to scheduling conflicts.
 

 
Concubine Chen, growing a bit annoyed, said: “Let him try a few more times. I’ll make him regret it and give him a psychological scar about women.”
 

 
The other personas were in awe.
 

 
The filming set for *Sea King Killer* was located in the villa area of the film city.
 

 
The holographic variety show would last for more than half a month, and the actors couldn’t stay in the set all the time. Therefore, medical teams and fitness trainers were provided to ensure that actors left the set daily for their required exercise to prevent muscle atrophy. This was a government mandate to prevent exploitative practices by unscrupulous production teams.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to arrive.
 

 
By the time she arrived, it was already quite late, and she found that the guest lineup was not complete; a male guest was missing.
 

 
Seeing her arrival, the director immediately approached her to explain: “Here’s the situation. The third male guest, Lu Yiqi… he’s in custody and won’t be able to make it to the shoot.”
 

 
“In custody?”
 

 
“For drunk driving.”
 

 
Tong Zhao understood; it seemed he was temporarily out of reach.
 

 
For holographic variety shows exceeding ten days of filming, due to certain risks, applications had to be reported in advance. Missing one person was acceptable, but adding one more was a serious legal issue, so the crew couldn’t find a replacement: “We’re filming with one less person?”
 

 
The director looked resigned: “It has to be this way, but there’s another issue…”
 

 
“You can go ahead.”
 

 
“Lu Yiqi drew the male Sea King card.”
 

 
That’s really problematic.
 

 
The Sea King has a key role; missing one significantly reduces the appeal.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but glance at Wei Zekai, suspecting that his bad luck was affecting everything he was involved in.
 

 
“Others don’t know yet. Our production team has discussed and has a somewhat unwelcome request,” the director said, biting his lip as he revealed their solution: “We can create a new male model for you. This way, your Sea King card in the show will have the ability to transform.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned for a moment.
 

 
Realizing that the idea was a bit outrageous, the director adopted a very humble stance and pleaded with her: “The pre-show hype has been so great, and we really don’t want to let this show, which is about to become a hit, slip away. We will also give you more screen time and opportunities to perform. What do you think?”
 

 
What did she think?
 

 
The more she looked at it, the more she felt that this director and the dog system were cut from the same cloth.
 

 
At that time, she had no preparation at all; she had just been transmigrated into a young, handsome guy named Han Zhi and lived a life as a man. Consequently, her mental palace also gained a male persona…
 

 
“Alright, but the model has to be handsome.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath and woke up the well-rested Han Zhi in her mind.
 

 
[Brother Zhi, get up and get to work.]
# Chapter28
Playing dual roles is almost impossible in instinctive films.
 

 
The vast majority of people's consciousness isn't strong enough to sustain it.
 

 
The director sought out Tong Zhao because the difference in character between Concubine Gui and Feng Yanqi is particularly large, and it's guessed that she has the best chance of handling it.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the medical team prepared for her by conducting a full set of brain scans and simple psychological tests to ensure her health wouldn’t be affected. They also assured her: “Dividing a person's consciousness into two parts can easily become particularly one-sided and extreme. We will explain to the audience that this is an exceptional case. If the modeling fails during the film, then… we’ll just have to accept losing one guest!”
 

 
In the end, everything was normal.
 

 
However, the medical team was puzzled by a set of codes in Tong Zhao's brain that could not be decrypted and were quite numerous. They suggested she visit a more specialized hospital or research institute for a check-up after filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled but remained silent.
 

 
The other guests, unaware of the change in situation, had already settled into the filming cabin early.
 

 
To split into two virtual models, the production team temporarily applied for the highest-level filming cabin, allowing Tong Zhao to sit alone in a more sophisticated filming device, covered in sensors. She closed her eyes, feeling a bit uneasy.
 

 
Han Zhi comforted her: "Don’t worry, the worst-case scenario is just that I’ll end up in the female model."
 

 
Concubine Gui: "I’m very worried. I don’t want to be a tofu grinder!"
 

 
…
 

 
Other personalities, along with Tong Zhao, gave sidelong glances at Concubine Gui's harsh words.
 

 
Under the influence of medication, Tong Zhao fell into a deep sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
"Can it really work?"
 

 
Backstage, the assistant director voiced everyone's concerns.
 

 
There have been cases of a person playing dual roles before.
 

 
There was an actor with a very strong “id” who, in a film exploring the self, split off another version of himself. As a result, he ended up with two extremely contrasting roles: one was aggressive and domineering towards subordinates, while the other was timid and insecure, craving others’ approval… In fact, combined, they represented the actor's true “id.” Every personality has both positive and negative sides, and theoretically, it should be possible.
 

 
But this was a renowned actor with a strong subconscious!
 

 
After being honed through dozens of instinctive films, Tong Zhao's consciousness thickness couldn't compare to someone who had acted in only two works.
 

 
A props team member muttered, “At worst, just act really effeminate. Anyway, Tong Zhao is good-looking, so being effeminate can be seen as being a pretty boy.”
 

 
“Success in separation!”
 

 
“Compatibility 100%, deployment can proceed.”
 

 
After a busy period for the backstage staff, Tong Zhao's consciousness was successfully split into two—
 

 
Countless people are curious about the composition of the soul.
 

 
Does the soul have weight?
 

 
What happens when a person loses their soul?
 

 
What exactly is the soul?
 

 
Is it in the heart or the brain?
 

 
The director sighed: “The code deconstructed from this scan should represent a person’s soul!”
 

 
※
 

 
On a perfectly sunny afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai got out of a luxury car with a suitcase and walked up to a mansion.
 

 
The mansion was surrounded by tall walls with greenery, and it had its own courtyard with the elegant sound of a small bridge and flowing water. From any angle, it could be called a mansion. However, Wei Zekai, wearing silver noise-canceling headphones, frowned slightly as he looked over the high-cost rental model code for the mansion used by the production team, clicking his tongue and saying, “This?”
 

 
…
 

 
“Can we drop a set of bird droppings code on him now? It should be quite explosive, right? The audience will support me! Modeling team, don’t you want to teach him a lesson?”
 

 
A props team member, who had developed a bit of envy toward the wealthy, earnestly sought advice from the modeling team.
 

 
To enhance the realism of the instinctive variety show, after the filming begins, guests are unaware that they are being recorded the entire time and only know they need to complete the task at hand. The brain automatically disregards any strange aspects.
 

 
For example, Wei Zekai's role, like in real life, is that of a super-rich second-generation heir. The production team discovered that viewers were very interested in his wealthy background, believing it would create good chemistry on the show.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai was portrayed as someone sent by his family to stay here for a month while also searching for a partner.
 

 
As he walked into the mansion, he answered a call from home: “I’ve arrived. Got it, stop nagging. If you keep insisting I bring a girlfriend back, I’ll bring a boyfriend back to surprise you!”
 

 
Of course, this was also a call arranged by the production team.
 

 
Combined with the voiceover and subtitles added in post-production, the audience quickly learned the current situation of the guests: they were to live in the mansion for a month and develop relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai did not disappoint the production team; his brief words effectively painted the image of a rebellious young man.
 

 
He turned the door handle and found three people already waiting inside.
 

 
Passing through the foyer, the entrance led to a spacious and luxurious living room. The three-story structure included multifunctional rooms, a maid’s room, a wine cellar, and numerous bedrooms, too many to count. Since everyone was required to gather first, three people were scattered on the living room sofa.
 

 
A young girl wearing glasses and another sweet-looking girl were whispering to each other, while a stern-looking man sat in an armchair, giving Wei Zekai a polite smile.
 

 
“The rooms on the second floor without nameplates are free to choose. You can put your luggage in a room first. There are still two people who haven’t arrived yet,” said the sweet girl in response to Wei Zekai’s puzzled look. “I’m Chang Xiaonian. The girl with glasses is Zhong Muxi, and this is Mr. He.”
 

 
“You don’t have a name?”
 

 
Wei Zekai turned to the man.
 

 
Mr. He smiled and said, “Just call me He Shun.”
 

 
“I’m Wei Zekai. Feel free to call me however you like.”
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced around the second floor, with the camera following his movements.
 

 
He looked back at the three people downstairs with confusion: “Aren’t there only maid’s rooms on the second floor? They’re so small!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi: “……”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian calmly responded, “The rooms are all the same size. They’re not small at all.”
 

 
In the instinctive variety show, Wei Zekai's emotional intelligence was on full display.
 

 
The backstage staff were tempted to arrange a bit of "heavenly bird droppings" for him.
 

 
Previously, the three who arrived first had marveled at the luxurious accommodations provided by the activity, saying it felt like a vacation. Anyone in such an environment would likely be inspired to pursue a romantic relationship!
 

 
Zhong Muxi had a poor impression of him and muttered quietly, “How can he be like this? The rooms are already very nice.”
 

 
“Wei Zekai… that name sounds familiar.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took out her phone to look him up online.
 

 
Of course, the information she found was about the character's background arranged by the production team.
 

 
But it was not much different from the real Wei Zekai.
 

 
Displayed before the two were countless names of industries and chain groups, along with some news highlighting his immense wealth. Zhong Muxi clicked her tongue in disdain and felt even less favorably towards him: “Someone this rich must definitely not lack women.”
 

 
“I actually think he’s pretty good,” Chang Xiaonian said, her eyes showing admiration after discovering Wei Zekai’s great wealth.
 

 
After Wei Zekai came downstairs, Chang Xiaonian took the initiative to explain the details of the activity.
 

 
It was similar to what the host had introduced earlier, but with added details about daily life.
 

 
“You must return to the mansion and clock in every night, and you can’t engage in any intimate behaviors like kissing or hugging. You can only choose one person as your romantic interest,” Chang Xiaonian read from the booklet. Seeing the "sea king" rules, Wei Zekai clicked his tongue again and said, “What the heck, a sea king? I despise people like that the most! It’s a desecration of pure love!”
 

 
……
 

 
The backstage staff were all shocked.
 

 
Their impression of the wealthy second-generation heir was rather stereotypical, and Wei Zekai’s reveal of a mermaid tattoo during the pre-show recording only added to his Playboy image. They didn’t expect his “true self” to make such a cliché statement about “pure love.”
 

 
Director: “...Instinctive variety shows are truly full of surprises.”
 

 
The writer, excited, said: “We could add a ‘Judge’s Comment’ effect in post-production. It turns out giving him that card was spot on.”
 

 
Wei Zekai plopped down into an armchair, acting all high and mighty.
 

 
“There are still two people missing. No sense of time at all, so disappointing.” After complaining, he put on his noise-canceling headphones and started playing a mobile game.
 

 
The wait extended from a clear afternoon to a cloudy evening.
 

 
Soon, the villa was enveloped in heavy rain, with occasional thunder adding a touch of a crime scene atmosphere reminiscent of a Conan murder case. It wasn’t really the fault of the “two people” for lacking a sense of time; it was because Tong Zhao was undergoing consciousness splitting and reorganization, which delayed her entry into the holographic space.
 

 
“The weather is so bad. Do you think they might come tomorrow instead?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked softly.
 

 
She wasn’t very confident in her own words and immediately turned her gaze to Chang Xiaonian, who had just become her friend. As Chang Xiaonian was about to speak, the door was opened—
 

 
In the foyer stood a young girl enveloped in a transparent raincoat.
 

 
Beneath the raincoat, she wore a pure white chiffon dress, the hem of which did not reach her knees. Her slender, beautiful legs were bathed in the soft light of the foyer, giving her skin a flawless, creamy appearance.
 

 
The raincoat was slightly oversized, making the girl seem even smaller, as if only her palm-sized face was peeking into the living room. Her light-colored eyes reflected a mix of innocent bewilderment and curiosity about the new place.
 

 
Even the production team, who had seen Tong Zhao in person before, were astonished by her appearance.
 

 
The director was a bit surprised: “She doesn’t look like Feng Yanqi at all.”
 

 
“Actually, she doesn’t look like Concubine Gui either.”
 

 
“No, she does,” said the staff member, a fan of Tong Zhao, who had gotten into it through *The Legend of Ming Dynasty* and had repeatedly watched the edited videos on Bilibili: “She looks especially like Concubine Gui when she first entered the palace!”
 

 
Enchanting men is an art, a skill that Concubine Gui absorbed from her experiences in the harem.
 

 
Starting with a weak position is always a safe choice.
 

 
……
 

 
“Sorry, I got stuck in traffic due to the typhoon.”
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke with a voice that was both soft and delicate, more pleasing than a nightingale's song.
 

 
She looked like a small white flower battered by a storm, innocent and pitiable.
 

 
The character background template implanted in Tong Zhao’s mind was that of a financially struggling female student.
 

 
Her parents had passed away, her grandmother was critically ill, and she needed to win this event to secure the prize money for her grandmother’s medical expenses and her own tuition fees.
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao's entrance, the director decided to have the voiceover introduce this background immediately.
 

 
From the moment she appeared, the audience became curious about this seemingly poisonous white flower.
 

 
“Am I the last one?” She frowned, looking very apologetic.
 

 
“No, there’s one more. You’re not the last to arrive.”
 

 
He Shun came to his senses, immediately stood up from the sofa, and took her luggage with a warm but not overly familiar attitude, explaining the details of the event. After receiving a grateful and admiring look from the pretty girl, he volunteered to help carry her luggage to her room.
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed uninterested in the other female guests and instead focused her beautiful eyes on Wei Zekai, who was engrossed in his game.
 

 
[This one seems a bit challenging.]
 

 
The production team captured her inner monologue.
 

 
Clearly, in her view, He Shun was just a simple, easygoing type of man.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually chose a bedroom without fussing over its size.
 

 
He Shun, being very gentlemanly, only carried her luggage into the room and didn’t step further inside. He returned to the living room sofa and explained to everyone, “Tong Zhao needs some time to freshen up before coming downstairs.”
 

 
“If you hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have known her name was Tong Zhao.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian said, a bit dissatisfied.
 

 
Women understand women best, and she immediately had a negative impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Since arriving, Tong Zhao’s gaze had only lingered on the men, briefly glancing at the two women, with her focus clearly on the men.
# Chapter29
The heavy rain was still continuing.
 

 
The three of them were hungry, so Chang Xiaonian went to the kitchen first to check the situation.
 

 
The usual pots, plates, spices, and cooking oil were all present, and the full rice jar was reassuring. The refrigerator was packed with drinks. However, there was a very conspicuous sticky note on the fridge:
 

 
[Ingredients in the kitchen are limited and will not be replenished once used.]
 

 
[Please make sure to complete tasks to earn living resources before the ingredients run out]
 

 
After explaining the situation to the others, Chang Xiaonian, a bit embarrassed, said, “I’m sorry, but I only know how to order takeout and make instant noodles…”
 

 
The other two showed similar awkward expressions.
 

 
Here, only Wei Zekai, with his “rich second-generation” identity, had the freedom to use money for takeout. However, given the torrential rain and the remote location of the villa, no delivery person was willing to come. Chang Xiaonian sighed, “Who would deliver without ten times the delivery fee!”
 

 
She glanced at Wei Zekai.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t care about the tenfold delivery fee.
 

 
And indeed, he didn’t.
 

 
However, what Wei Zekai said next surprised the staff:
 

 
“Is this a matter of money? With an eighth-level typhoon and torrential rain outside, if a delivery person is tempted by the tenfold fee and something happens to them while delivering, how long would I feel bad about it? I’d be at a loss.”
 

 
How could he...
 

 
Turn such morally high-grounded statements into a pompous rant?
 

 
The production team felt conflicted.
 

 
“I can’t cook either,” He Shun said, looking at the closed door on the second floor. “I don’t know if Tong Zhao can, but she just arrived, so let her rest for a while. Can’t the kitchen have some unpacked food? Surely, she can boil water and cook noodles.”
 

 
Saying this, he seemed just as unwilling to make a move.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at him anxiously.
 

 
She could actually cook, though not particularly well. She had been used as a free maid by her ex for two years, and since the breakup, she had been afraid to show her capable side in front of men... [What’s the use of being capable? Being a nanny to men will only make you seem like an old hag.]
 

 
This bit of negative mental activity was also captured by the AI.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows amplify human traits infinitely; as long as they hit a point of resonance with the audience, they can achieve high ratings.
 

 
Accompanied by the rumbling thunder, the three people with their own agendas fell into silence.
 

 
The door was opened again.
 

 
The man folded his black umbrella. The rain had left droplets on his dark hair, and his white shirt was slightly damp, clinging to his skin and outlining well-defined lines. His chest muscles and abs were enough to make one instinctively swallow. After putting away the umbrella and changing into indoor shoes, he looked up at everyone, revealing an exceptionally handsome face.
 

 
He was stunningly handsome.
 

 
If it weren’t for the sharp jawline, one might believe he was a beautiful woman.
 

 
The man obviously looked tired from the journey; his light amber eyes were not sparkling and lacked the intimidating sharpness. They resembled those of a slightly tipsy traveler, clouded with an indescribable haze, giving anyone a poetic sense of unspoken thoughts.
 

 
He was very tired.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao, having just finished washing her hair and wearing a floral nightgown with half-dry hair, emerged from the bedroom and met his gaze.
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
[Wow, top-notch.]
 

 
“Sorry for arriving a bit late,”
 

 
The man didn’t think much of it and simply smiled at everyone:
 

 
“Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ meaning ‘persistent.’”
 

 
……
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao, the two female guests blushed simultaneously.
 

 
He Shun was handsome among successful people and a looker even among ordinary folks, while Wei Zekai was a young, attractive man who could live off his looks. However, compared to the man in front of them… they fell far short. Even a single glance from Han Zhi was on a completely different level. No woman could resist him, even if he was tired.
 

 
Or perhaps because Han Zhi was tired.
 

 
A handsome and commanding man gives off a sense of pressure. Women are drawn to strength and also have a certain maternal instinct, and Han Zhi embodied the perfect combination of these two qualities.
 

 
Han Zhi was composed; through his eyes, one could feel his rock-solid inner strength. No problem could defeat him, and there was nothing he couldn’t solve. Indecisive and weak-willed? He was certainly someone you could rely on. At the same time, he seemed tired, and if you met his gaze, he would wave you over to rest your head on his shoulder, gently kiss the top of your head, and be tender and affectionate.
 

 
At this moment, the production team’s identity card for him was gradually revealed through special effects and narration:
 

 
【“The King of the Sea” and “Writer” Han Zhi. He is an unknown writer who attracts female readers through his good looks and receives continuous rewards. His book signings are like star meet-and-greets. His editor once lamented that if his writing were a bit better, he wouldn’t be so poor.】
 

 
【Han Zhi’s early life was full of women. He sought fame and praise, was always chasing new interests while getting bored with the old, and no matter how beautiful the woman, she could not stay on his girlfriend’s throne for more than a month.】
 

 
After understanding the current situation, Han Zhi said, “Wait for me to change clothes, and then I’ll make dinner.”
 

 
Hearing that someone volunteered to cook, Wei Zekai took off his headphones and looked at him appreciatively: “Thanks, brother. I’m starving.”
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian regretted not having learned how to cook better.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa drying her hair, which was also a dramatic, murder-like gesture.
 

 
The director was completely unprepared for the normally efficient and sharp Tong Zhao to appear as a naive and cute water lily in this reality show.
 

 
As Tong Zhao dried her hair, she shivered and sneezed.
 

 
She rubbed her red nose, and her unadorned face appeared even more charming.
 

 
She was already a young girl, and with this youthful appearance, she looked like a little loli.
 

 
If Tong Zhao's inner thoughts hadn't been captured, this would indeed be a very cute scene.
 

 
However, the production team clearly heard Tong Zhao, after casting a shy glance at Han Zhi’s waist, think to herself: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
If Han Zhi were another male celebrity, this could have caused a major incident.
 

 
But considering Han Zhi's true identity as an “extreme” type, the production team exchanged a complex look…
 

 
After changing into casual clothes, Han Zhi went straight to the kitchen to cook.
 

 
Soon, a spread of two meat dishes and three vegetable dishes was served on the long table in the living room. Han Zhi also made a mushroom soup. After everyone tasted it, they were captivated by the incredibly fresh and delicious flavor, each person drinking two large bowls.
 

 
He Shun was surprised, "Mr. Han’s cooking skills are really impressive. Young people these days... well, actually me too, are used to eating takeout. We get so used to it that we forget how to cook, and the mere thought of cooking is a headache."
 

 
"My ex-girlfriend had a stomach condition and couldn’t eat takeout," Han Zhi said, laughing at himself. "After we broke up, I didn’t let my cooking skills go to waste. Being able to make sure everyone doesn’t go hungry today is a way for them to come in handy."
 

 
His mastery of language was employed to its fullest extent.
 

 
He didn’t say why they broke up, but how bad could a man who learned to cook for a girlfriend with a stomach issue be? Coupled with his slightly melancholic eyes, his affectionate image was vividly conveyed in just a few sentences.
 

 
Indeed, Zhong Muxi, who remained cautious around all males, cast a sympathetic look toward him.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished a bowl of rice, she looked up with a satisfied smile and said, "I really envy Han Zhi’s girlfriend."
 

 
Her obedient and sweet little loli image was well established.
 

 
But despite how soft and sweet her voice sounded, the intelligent AI scanning of her inner thoughts revealed a starkly contrasting, coldly mocking sentiment:
 

 
[All men’s descriptions of their exes are probably all the same.]
 

 
[Think about it. Which man would brag about being abandoned by an ex? It’s not just about hiding it; they wouldn’t mention it at all. Showing weakness always hides something ulterior—he’s just trying to create a sentimental image.]
 

 
[The cooking is actually quite good.]
 

 
“Same here.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, who enjoyed the meal, chimed in with a somewhat awkward tone.
 

 
And his inner thoughts were quite honest: [Wow, this soup is delicious. I really want to hire him as a personal chef.]
 

 
After the meal, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi took on the responsibility of washing the dishes voluntarily.
 

 
Han Zhi, who cooked, was not expected to wash dishes as well.
 

 
This also highlighted the "true selves" of the remaining three.
 

 
The chauvinistic He Shun thought that anything related to housework had nothing to do with men.
 

 
Wei Zekai always believed that dishes and furniture would clean themselves automatically and that meals would appear hot and ready on time.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao…
 

 
[Fortunately, I wasn’t asked to wash dishes. But if I were, I’d need to find a good tool to help.]
 

 
The production team: "..."
 

 
This is just too lazy!
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really this lazy?
 

 
Feng Yanqi’s character was not like this!
 

 
The assistant director clicked his tongue in amazement: “Good looks really give an advantage. I actually don’t find her annoying. She’s like a kitten looking for a caretaker, glancing around.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was assessing the three men in her mind.
 

 
[Wei Zekai clearly can’t do housework. He’s a useless layabout.]
 

 
[The top-notch guy should be saved for later. He’s a bit hard to figure out. I’ll handle the others first. Anyway, Han Zhi doesn’t seem the type to back off just because someone else is flirting.]
 

 
[Hmm, let’s start with the guy named He!]
 

 
The female sea king took the initiative, and the production team perked up, knowing there would be content to film.
 

 
What is the modern version of a queen’s flirtation like?
 

 
At the same time, the night fell.
 

 
After everyone clocked in and returned to their rooms:
 

 
When Wei Zekai got back to his room, he didn’t continue playing games. Instead, he took out a collar from his suitcase.
 

 
Though he was alone in the room, he nervously looked around to make sure no one else was present before putting on the collar: “Does it really have this magical function... damn!”
 

 
With a very cartoonish smoke effect, Wei Zekai disappeared.
 

 
In his place was a golden-brown dog.
 

 
[As a bold and unruly prodigy with the titles of "Judgment Officer" and "Rich Second Generation," you have an important task this time besides finding your beloved person—discover the hidden sea king among you and protect true love! To enhance your investigative abilities, you will have the power to transform for one hour each day.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...Woof!”
 

 
What’s the point of guarding someone else’s love?
 

 
But transforming into a dog is quite novel, so Wei Zekai decided to go for a walk.
 

 
The soft little paw pads made no sound as they stepped on the soft mat. The small Zekai quietly made its way downstairs, hearing some noise from the kitchen.
 

 
Hmm?
 

 
Could someone be sneaking a midnight snack?
 

 
Wei Zekai wagged its tail excitedly, curious about who might be so hungry.
 

 
However, as it entered the kitchen, the noise became clearer—it was the sound of a girl sobbing.
 

 
“Why did you have to leave me... couldn’t you stay with me a little longer? I thought many times about you leaving me, but I didn’t expect that when the day actually came... it’s so scary…”
 

 
The frantic and confused whispers, mixed with the suppressed crying, made the little Zekai’s tail bristle.
 

 
It peered around and saw an even more horrifying scene.
 

 
The usually subdued and gloomy Zhong Muxi was repeatedly cutting her wrist with a fruit knife.
 

 
In the place where her watch was removed, there were overlapping fresh and old wounds of varying depths.
 

 
The girl did not intend to end her life.
 

 
Through the pain, she seemed to gradually calm down. After washing the blood off the fruit knife, she regretfully rushed back to her room on the second floor.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was experiencing being a dog for the first time, wanted to hide in shock.
 

 
Although his movements were slow, he stood in a blind spot due to his short legs and was not discovered.
 

 
So, this is how serious the harm from a breakup can be?
 

 
Wei Zekai was deeply shocked.
 

 
He thought about the other two men in the villa, one of whom might be the sea king and a scumbag...
 

 
The little dog shook its fur and wore a serious expression on its face.
 

 
At that moment, it felt a profound sense of mission.
# Chapter30
The camera pulls up, giving a bird's-eye view of the entire estate.
 

 
In the shot, each bedroom door gradually becomes transparent, revealing what each guest is doing.
 

 
The smart AI automatically identifies restricted and overly private scenes.
 

 
If a guest is changing clothes, that door will not become transparent, and even the production team cannot secretly peek.
 

 
...
 

 
He Shun is flipping through a book.
 

 
Zhong Muxi, who has returned to her room, is holding a first aid kit and iodine to treat her wound. She lets her tears slowly dry on her cheeks, her face showing numbness. This small first aid kit is something she brought in her luggage, and it’s clear that this self-harming behavior has been going on for some time. She is also quite accustomed to cleaning up the mess left on her body after an emotional breakdown.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian is lying on the bed playing with her phone, and the smart AI enlarges the screen of her phone.
 

 
"Prince Street No. 23"
 

 
"The Young Master's Rule"
 

 
"Sparrow Wants to Rise"
 

 
"No wonder she's so nice to Wei Zekai; turns out she likes prince-and-princess love stories," the young stagehand said.
 

 
Tong Zhao placed all the bottles and jars she had brought on the desk and was going through a complicated skincare routine. While she was applying body lotion to her calves, the director, with a bit of self-interest, had the camera linger on her for a moment, treating it as a fan-service shot for the audience.
 

 
The camera panned to the last bedroom—Han Zhi's room.
 

 
He was sitting at his desk, holding a sketchbook.
 

 
When drawing, Han Zhi wore glasses. The frameless, square glasses concealed the emotions in his passionate eyes, giving him a touch of cool abstinence and intellect. His pale, slender fingers held a pencil, and in no time, a gentle and simple face appeared on the paper.
 

 
The assistant director widened his eyes in surprise, "He actually likes Zhong Muxi?"
 

 
Who would have thought that the "sea king" would first set his sights on an unremarkable girl with glasses?
 

 
Not to mention Tong Zhao, who is stunningly beautiful, even Chang Xiaonian, who has a sweet and cute style, looks better than Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It's not polite to judge someone's appearance, but the entire production team was genuinely surprised.
 

 
The young stagehand made a sound, "Hmm. Some guys like him are like that. They go after plain, honest girls because they're easier to control... Think about it—if a handsome guy like Han Zhi confessed to you, wouldn't you feel particularly surprised, like you're unworthy? Even if you fought or argued in a relationship, you'd want to slap yourself for it."
 

 
As he spoke, Han Zhi gently tore out the completed sketch from his sketchbook and carefully placed it in the drawer.
 

 
Then, he began to draw on a new page.
 

 
Even if he is handsome, there's no point in continuously filming him just drawing, so the director was about to switch the camera when he noticed something unusual.
 

 
This time, Han Zhi was drawing a different face.
 

 
Lively, spirited round eyes and lips that always curve up into a sweet smile—the face of Chang Xiaonian, who the production team had just been discussing.
 

 
Production team: "..."
 

 
So, he's really just an expert at keeping things balanced?
 

 
After finishing, Han Zhi carefully tore out this sketch as well and put it away.
 

 
The assistant director, who had some experience with sketching from studying art, watched for a while and remarked, "Han Zhi is quite skilled at drawing. You can tell who it is, but he makes them look even better than in real life; he's very good at capturing the highlights."
 

 
Even Zhong Muxi, who was labeled as "ordinary" by the production team, appeared different under Han Zhi's pen. With her eyes lowered, he captured the graceful lines of her neck when she looked down. Only then did everyone realize that Zhong Muxi actually had a nice side profile, with a well-proportioned head and neck, looking fragile and delicate enough to evoke sympathy.
 

 
Han Zhi has a keen eye for discovering the good qualities in others.
 

 
If he could make someone so ordinary look so good, how stunning must Tong Zhao look under his pen?
 

 
The production team couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.
 

 
However, the previously inspired Han Zhi encountered difficulties when drawing the third sketch. Several times, he completed rough drafts only to tear them up and crumple them into a ball. After three repeated attempts, he finally drew a large, messy question mark over the oval face draft he had completed.
 

 
The small night lamp cast a warm glow on half of his face.
 

 
"I'm starting to think I'm filming an idol drama here. He doesn't need much directing at all—he's a man who naturally looks good on camera. Any random shot looks like a movie poster. If Tong Zhao were a man, she might achieve even more success!" the director said.
 

 
Leading roles for women in films are still a rarity.
 

 
You could say it's a blue ocean market, but no one wants to explore it; everyone thinks it's unprofitable. There are almost no actresses who can carry a box office hit—most of them just add a little extra appeal. However, actresses have their strengths: their "true selves" are more consistent and less likely to fall apart in their performances, even if they rarely shine.
 

 
While the production team drifted off-topic, Han Zhi put down his pencil, stuffed the sketchbook into the drawer, and furrowed his brows.
 

 
※
 

 
Early the next morning, Wei Zekai woke up very early.
 

 
He had a nightmare.
 

 
He dreamed that Zhong Muxi had slashed down with a knife, severing the major artery in her wrist, and blood kept gushing out, covering the floor. The fear from the morning shock still lingered. Being a young boy who gets hungry quickly, he habitually goes downstairs. Seeing the empty dining room, he remembered he wasn’t at home; no aunt woke up earlier than everyone to prepare breakfast, and a wave of sadness came over him.
 

 
He hadn’t been sad for long when he smelled the aroma of food.
 

 
Sniffing the air, he walked towards the kitchen and saw a tall, slender figure.
 

 
Han Zhi was cooking something delicious.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up, and at the same time, Han Zhi happened to turn around.
 

 
Han Zhi had no particular interest in cooking for another man, but when he saw the hungry young master staring at him with eyes practically turning green from hunger, he gave a gentle smile. “I’m a bit hungry. If you don’t mind, would you like to eat together?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn't have asked for anything better.
 

 
In the skillet, there was a pot of diced tomatoes, green and red peppers, onions, and bacon being stir-fried, with two sunny-side-up eggs cracked in. The wobbling egg yolks were incredibly appetizing, and the smell was irresistible. The rich tomato juice mixed with the egg yolk, perfectly paired with lightly toasted bread, awakened both the stomach and taste buds in the early morning. Han Zhi had also prepared a pot of plain porridge, blending Western and Eastern styles seamlessly.
 

 
Even Wei Zekai, who was used to eating all kinds of delicacies, was captivated by Han Zhi's cooking skills.
 

 
After hearing Wei Zekai's praise of him, Han Zhi was momentarily stunned and said, "This is just Shakshuka made with last night's leftover scraps, nothing extraordinary."
 

 
Here, a segment of Han Zhi's inner monologue was mixed in:
 

 
[The same goes for love.]
 

 
[When you've dated a lot and have all kinds of beauties at your fingertips, your pursuit begins to diversify. There isn’t a girl who isn't worthy of my love. If other men think a girl is ordinary, it's because they lack the ability to polish a rough diamond or uncover a hidden treasure. That's their incompetence, not the girl's fault.]
 

 
Assistant Director: "Damn, he’s so poetic in his player ways."
 

 
The scriptwriter joked, "How about we cut this part and let me steal it for my novel?"
 

 
The young stagehand was puzzled: "Is that being a player? I think what he said sounds quite pleasant. If this is what being a player is like, I'd like to be played by him!"
 

 
The production team debated endlessly about whether Han Zhi's mindset was considered "playing" or not, until the props team, staying true to their focus, gently reminded them, "Wake up, everyone. He's just a subconscious manifestation split from Tong Zhao; this man doesn’t actually exist in reality."
 

 
The statement jolted everyone to their senses.
 

 
The assistant director, however, came up with a new idea: "Hey, how about we reveal Han Zhi’s true identity only after this season airs?"
 

 
"Good idea! Since Han Zhi has managed to charm the women in our team so thoroughly... Forget about his charisma, just look at that face—who wouldn't love it? Is this really extracted from Tong Zhao's memory? She’s got quite the imagination!"
 

 
"Then, we could create a trending topic like #DemandHanZhiToDebut and build up some hype, followed by a plot twist later. That would definitely make a splash!"
 

 
...
 

 
Amidst their discussions, the rest of the people gradually woke up.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi came to an agreement and cooked a pot of noodles to share, deliberately not making any for Tong Zhao and He Shun.
 

 
After eating their fill, the two girls curled up on the sofa, whispering while watching TV, gossiping about how Tong Zhao was a “green tea bitch.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi hesitated a bit, "She didn’t really do anything, right…?"
 

 
"Women understand women best!" Chang Xiaonian declared confidently. "I knew it last night during dinner. She didn’t even look at us and only responded to the guys. It was super obvious. I just don’t know which one she’s targeting. Hopefully, she’ll leave Wei Zekai alone. I think Teacher He would suit her better; he kept staring at her."
 

 
"That He teacher is pretty annoying too. Calling him 'teacher' is already giving him too much credit. You can tell he’s got a 'straight man cancer' mentality—probably the kind who would dump all the household chores on his wife after marriage and treat her like a nanny. Asking him to step into the kitchen is like asking him to sacrifice himself."
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded silently.
 

 
She wasn’t interested in finding a partner in this event, so she didn’t care who Tong Zhao tried to flirt with. However, Chang Xiaonian was her only female friend in this unfamiliar environment, so she wouldn’t contradict her friend just for Tong Zhao.
 

 
But just as Zhong Muxi nodded, she heard the sound of the sofa sinking down beside her.
 

 
The two were startled and looked toward the source of the sound, only to find that the very person they had been talking about—Tong Zhao—was sitting on the single-seater sofa sipping a yogurt. Her fair and delicate face was adorned with a subtle “no-makeup” makeup look, and her almond-shaped eyes cast a casual, teasing glance in their direction.
 

 
[Did she hear what we were just saying?]
 

 
[Whatever, so what if she did hear? We’re not friends anyway; saying a few bad things behind someone’s back is pretty normal!]
 

 
This was Chang Xiaonian’s inner monologue.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also worried that Tong Zhao had overheard them, so she looked down and pretended to be playing on her phone.
 

 
In this reality show focused on natural interactions, storylines of girls scheming against each other were also very popular with viewers, so the AI instantly captured Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao had indeed heard everything.
 

 
She thought that what Chang Xiaonian said made a lot of sense.
 

 
Concubine Chen wasn't interested in women at all and didn't care about their opinions of her.
 

 
"I totally didn't notice you come over. How do you walk so quietly?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian awkwardly tried to start a conversation.
 

 
Tong Zhao swung her well-proportioned legs and chuckled, "Maybe it's because I'm too light. Oh well, I'll just have to try harder to gain some weight."
 

 
The ordinary girls who gain weight no matter how much they eat: "..."
 

 
Without any men around, the "Concubine" wasn't pretending to be innocent at all.
 

 
At this moment, she resembled a flamboyant carnivorous flower; every glance and smile seemed to flaunt her beauty.
 

 
After speaking, Tong Zhao patted her flat stomach. "Talking about gaining weight makes me hungry. I'll go ask Teacher He to make me something to eat."
 

 
?
 

 
Do you not have hands of your own?
 

 
Question marks popped up in the heads of the two girls.
 

 
After a while, Chang Xiaonian saw He Shun—whom she had labeled as someone who would absolutely never do housework—enter the kitchen with a "can't say no to you" smile and make Tong Zhao a bowl of fried sauce noodles. After she happily finished eating, he even took the initiative to wash the bowl.
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Where did your macho attitude go?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was shocked to her core.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also a bit surprised.
 

 
Teacher He resembled her ex-boyfriend a lot, so when Xiaonian bluntly said that He Shun would never do housework, she agreed wholeheartedly. However, seeing this scene made her somewhat confused.
# Chapter31
"I can’t figure it out."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stole a glance at Tong Zhao, who was happily eating fruit at the long dining table. "It seems like that woman really has her eyes on Teacher He, but... she hasn’t done anything at all. Why is Mr. He being so attentive to her?"
 

 
"I don’t know either."
 

 
Zhong Muxi looked down, hiding the envy in her eyes.
 

 
He Shun’s "straight man cancer" was quite evident, and he also showed signs of looking down on women.
 

 
Just like her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
Of course, her ex had many advantages—he was a prominent figure in school, came from a well-off family, and had a smooth career path after graduation. If she hadn’t pursued him in college, she might never have encountered such an outstanding man in the workplace.
 

 
Back then, Zhong Muxi did all the laundry and cooking for her boyfriend, delivering freshly washed fruit to his dorm, and baking handmade cookies and various snacks. Because he had expressed a desire for a virtuous partner, she strived to fit the mold of his ideal companion, believing that meeting the “CHD Girlfriend Requirements” would secure the bright future he had envisioned.
 

 
Zhong Muxi had far exceeded those expectations.
 

 
She didn’t want her boyfriend to worry, so after starting work and moving in together, she took on all the household chores.
 

 
She didn’t dare to stay late at work to improve her performance because she needed to get home earlier than her boyfriend so that he could have hot meals when he arrived after working overtime.
 

 
But all she received in return was increasing impatience.
 

 
Her boyfriend told her to improve herself, but after work, she was too exhausted from cooking and doing housework to have time for the gym. He paid the rent and utilities but never cared about the cost of groceries, yet he would give her the cold shoulder if there was no meat or seafood on the table, putting down his chopsticks after only a few bites.
 

 
Eventually, because she was too ordinary and unambitious, her boyfriend ended their relationship amicably.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t want an amicable breakup, but she couldn’t learn how to cry, argue, or fight.
 

 
So in the end, all her destructive impulses and hatred, like the utility knife in her hand, turned inward, with the blade pointing at herself.
 

 
She lifted her eyes to look at Tong Zhao, who had finished eating and pushed the bowl towards He Shun. Her eyes, behind her glasses, were filled with complex longing.
 

 
After everyone had their fill, the large screen TV in the living room lit up with colorful images.
 

 
The variety show had a main storyline driving the guests’ actions to increase viewer interest.
 

 
In the show, guests had to complete mandatory tasks, which varied randomly. Completing them would yield corresponding random rewards, while failure meant facing penalties.
 

 
Everyone turned their gaze to the giant screen.
 

 
"Love won't come just by sitting around. Now, the official provides you with an opportunity to get familiar with each other. Please choose one and head to the game room!"
 

 
"1: Werewolf"
 

 
"2: Truth or Dare"
 

 
"3: King's Game"
 

 
"Isn't it better to quickly get acquainted by playing Honor of Kings together?" Wei Zekai was unimpressed by the official game options. The first two seemed too old-fashioned, and the third was something he had only heard of in nightclubs and bars, not a serious game.
 

 
Han Zhi said they should follow everyone's preference.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind.
 

 
He Shun naturally took over the decision-making and chose Truth or Dare.
 

 
His internal monologue at this moment also had a personal touch: [Werewolf... this kind of brain-intensive game is no fun when half the participants are women; they think too emotionally. The King's Game is a bit vulgar, so Truth or Dare is a better choice.]
 

 
The stage crew girl said, "I really want to hit him. What should I do?"
 

 
Other female staff members echoed her sentiments.
 

 
---
 

 
The game room was very spacious, equipped with both popular and rare board games.
 

 
As everyone walked into the room, a board labeled “Truth or Dare” was quietly placed on a round table, with chairs around it marked with their names, suggesting they should sit in an alternating gender arrangement.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat between Wei Zekai and Han Zhi.
 

 
He Shun glanced towards her and hesitated before suggesting he wanted to switch seats.
 

 
“Han Zhi…”
 

 
He had just begun to speak when Han Zhi’s piercing gaze made him feel as if his thoughts were being clearly seen through a high-powered lens. He Shun instinctively felt a bit unnerved and instead asked Wei Zekai, who, although tall, was clearly more of a big boy than a man, “Can I switch seats with you?”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t really care where he sat.
 

 
What difference did it make where he sat to play a game?
 

 
Just as he was about to impatiently agree, Wei Zekai suddenly recalled the unsettling scene in the kitchen last night and the heavy responsibility he had—he wasn’t here just to play; finding a partner was secondary. His main goal was to identify the "sea king" among these people.
 

 
He Shun, who seemed to have an inexplicable reason to switch seats, was highly suspicious!
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaze suddenly became sharp.
 

 
“Why do you want to switch seats with me?” Wei Zekai asked, his tone unfriendly.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai's arrogant and overbearing demeanor didn't raise He Shun's suspicions. He simply muttered inwardly about the wealthy but uncultured young master.
 

 
"I’m more familiar with Zhao Zhao and can take better care of her," He Shun said.
 

 
He was speaking the truth.
 

 
Tong Zhao was very poor at taking care of herself.
 

 
She almost burned her hand while boiling water to cook noodles (actually, she hadn't even touched the boiling water; she was just pretending to protect her delicate fingers). She had never washed a dish at home and was a little princess raised under strict care from her family (according to her own story). Although He Shun's mother treated him like a prince, he still had basic life knowledge, but it depended on whether he wanted to apply it.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had never done it, it was only right for him to handle it.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the adoring and dependent look in the young girl's eyes, He Shun couldn't resist and quickly became her tool.
 

 
"Do we really need to take care of each other while playing a game?" Hearing this poor excuse, Wei Zekai’s gaze became even sharper. Although their conversation was quiet, it gradually drew the attention of others. He Shun, feeling embarrassed, said, “Forget it, it’s nothing.” He then returned to his original seat.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who was seated next to He Shun as arranged by the production team, clearly heard everything, and her previous delight at sitting next to Wei Zekai had vanished.
 

 
What’s up with this He guy?
 

 
Is it really such a burden for him to sit next to a girl?
 

 
Does Tong Zhao really need all that special care? Is she like a modern-day princess with her older knight?
 

 
Han Zhi picked up the "Truth or Dare" cards and began shuffling. He held the cards with three fingers, smoothly fanned them with his thumb, first displaying them and then pressing and flipping them in a fluid, pleasing manner.
 

 
Han Zhi said, “The rules are simple: you can’t choose 'Truth' or 'Dare' consecutively.”
 

 
The game room also had a large screen.
 

 
A mechanical synthesized voice explained the rules: “For those who choose 'Dare,' the task will be randomly selected by the official and shown on the screen. For 'Truth,' the player who draws the smallest numbered card will decide whether to answer their own question or one selected by the screen. If a player lies during 'Truth,' the lie detector here will sound.”
 

 
“Questions that are prohibited include:
 

 
- Restricted or offensive questions.
 
- Questions about the identity cards drawn by others.
 
- Players can choose to refuse to answer and directly accept a punishment task.”
 

 
It sounded like choosing 'Truth' was relatively easier.
 

 
In the first round, Han Zhi drew the ghost card.
 

 
"It seems like I'm having bad luck today," Han Zhi said helplessly, shaking the ghost card in his hand. "I'll go with 'Truth.'"
 

 
The player who drew the smallest number card was Wei Zekai.
 

 
What should he ask?
 

 
Wei Zekai had a sudden idea, realizing this was a great opportunity to probe—although he couldn’t directly ask if the person was a playboy, he could indirectly gather the truth and infer the result. The truth was singular, and at this moment, he was like Detective Conan’s grandfather!
 

 
After a moment of contemplation, he cautiously asked, “Could you elaborate on your views on relationships?”
 

 
In Wei Zekai’s limited understanding of emotional intelligence, a playboy was necessarily detestable and had a distorted worldview.
 

 
...
 

 
From Han Zhi's perspective, which was unaffected by any identity card, romantic relationships were not within his realm of consideration.
 

 
As a top celebrity carrying the dreams of countless young girls, if he fell in love with someone, it would shatter the dreams of those girls. Before joining the reality show, Tong Zhao thought that his lack of romantic experience made him suitable for the task because...
 

 
He was very skilled at making others fall in love with him.
 

 
Of course, after entering the show, Han Zhi's mind had been filled with a large number of “exes” that matched his views on relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai's expression was intense and probing when he asked, not like he was playing a game.
 

 
He was very serious in his mind.
 

 
And this was also the reason why, in his past life, Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao grew further apart. Wei Zekai, who had no concept of being smooth or diplomatic, interacted with people in a very raw manner. He could turn good intentions into something annoying and bothersome. If he weren't so good-looking, he would indeed be more suited to play a comic villain in a comedy.
 

 
“Well,”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him with surprise, seemingly not expecting a man to be interested in his views on relationships.
 

 
His aesthetic preferences were only for women, but if Wei Zekai was dressed as a girl...
 

 
He imagined it in his mind and thought, it might not be so bad.
 

 
This image was vividly captured by the AI, comparable to the fantasy of Snape in a dress from the wizarding world.
 

 
The director immediately decided to include this scene in the highlight preview.
 

 
Han Zhi briefly pondered, then his lips and eyes curved into a gentle smile. Even such a playful question from a rich, rebellious young man was taken seriously by him. Everyone heard him say: “It should be about bringing happiness to those who like me. I would want her to know that in my eyes, she is unique and shining.”
 

 
He had a deep, mellow voice.
 

 
Even though he was speaking very normal things and not affecting his tone, his words seemed to penetrate the eardrums, causing a tingling sensation. The other two female guests couldn't help but have their hearts race and faces flush.
 

 
It’s not scary if a playboy is handsome; it’s frightening if a playboy is also a warm-hearted man.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao raised her hand and scratched her ear, giving him a very harsh label:
 

 
"Pure desire has become a demon, this is something else."
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately knew he was downplaying the issue.
 

 
The lie detector didn’t go off, most likely because he truly thought that way.
 

 
She had a keen eye for people, and Han Zhi was definitely not superficial.
 

 
But others didn’t see it that way.
 

 
Especially Wei Zekai—
 

 
He was moved!
 

 
How could someone with such pure thoughts possibly be a playboy?
 

 
Even if he drew the special identity card of a playboy, he surely wouldn’t harm girls!
 

 
Detective Wei Zekai first ruled out one correct answer and categorized Han Zhi into the safe group in his mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed sarcastically in her mind, not expecting that in the next round she would draw "Dare."
 

 
"Dare: Please have the 'Ghost King' and the person who drew the smallest number come to Room 2 at 8 PM tonight and mold a pair of ceramic couple cups."
 

 
He Shun immediately looked at his card.
 

 
Unfortunately, he drew a rather large number, so he had little hope.
 

 
"Ah."
 

 
The old enchantress sitting next to Tong Zhao, who was both pure and seductive, gently shook her square two cards.
# Chapter32
In the second round, Zhong Muxi drew the "Ghost" card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who drew the smallest card, didn't make things difficult for her; she just asked what Zhong Muxi's favorite food was. Zhong Muxi quietly answered "Cake," and the game continued. Compared to the handsome men and beautiful women present, no one seemed to care about her answer. It was as if, in school, she was just one of those ordinary students whom no one paid much attention to, neither bullied nor interested in.
 

 
As she spoke, Zhong Muxi's gaze was lowered.
 

 
This caused her to miss the fact that Han Zhi had been intently watching her throughout her answer.
 

 
In the next round, Wei Zekai, who drew another "Dare," had to cook a meal with Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Both of them were clueless about cooking and were instantly at a loss, while Chang Xiaonian was somewhat pleased.
 

 
These little details about the girls were fully revealed on camera.
 

 
In the third round, He Shun, who drew the "Ghost King" card, chose "Truth." Zhong Muxi impulsively asked him, "What type of girl do you like?"
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
"Probably a gentle and virtuous girl, someone more homey. I place a lot of importance on family warmth.”
 

 
He Shun was also a bit surprised but answered the straightforward question honestly.
 

 
【So this glasses-wearing girl has an interest in me too?】 He Shun's inner voice held a trace of condescension.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at the lie detector and quickly looked down.
 

 
Her hands clenched tightly under the table.
 

 
Zhong Muxi's inner thoughts were on the verge of breaking down: 【How could there be no lie? Am I not gentle or virtuous enough? Tong Zhao can't cook or wash dishes! Why lie? Why?】
 

 
……
 

 
The lighting technician was surprised: "Were Zhong Muxi and He Shun in a relationship before?"
 

 
"No, they didn’t know each other before joining the reality show. Zhong Muxi doesn't have any feelings for He Shun," the director said, showing the detected affection level. Zhong Muxi's affection for He Shun was only 30, which fell into the category of "feeling uncomfortable being alone with him in an elevator."
 

 
The scriptwriter sympathetically looked at the glasses-wearing girl on the observation screen: "Didn’t Zhong Muxi think that He Shun resembled her ex-boyfriend? Maybe she projected the same doubts. Why, even though He Shun says he likes gentle and virtuous girls, he end up showing affection to a princess-type girl who doesn't know anything?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi drew the dare card again, and her task was to watch a romantic movie with Han Zhi.
 

 
In the final round, Tong Zhao drew the ghost card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian asked her how many boyfriends she had had, with a hint of curiosity and mild jealousy in her probing.
 

 
In this reality show, Tong Zhao’s identity card indicated that she had no romantic experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao's eyes curved slightly, and a genuine smile spread across her lips.
 

 
"None."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who also had no romantic experience, looked at her with a look of approval, noting that she should be protected.
 

 
The burden on the judge's shoulders was indeed heavy.
 

 
*
 

 
The screen in the game room announced that the task was successfully completed.
 

 
Today's reward was that all players would receive a day's worth of ingredients.
 

 
Since it was only the second day, everyone was still not very familiar with each other. The two young girls stuck together like conjoined twins, while He Shun and Tong Zhao carried out the task on their identity cards—He Shun was the "teacher" and had to tutor Tong Zhao, who drew the "female student" card. Over the course of a month, there would be three tests, and failure to pass would result in penalties for both.
 

 
Although there was a study room in the estate, Tong Zhao requested to have the classes at the long table in the living room, citing He Shun’s gender as the reason.
 

 
He Shun agreed, showing no outward dissatisfaction, but felt a bit regretful inside.
 

 
The production team observed that his favorability towards Tong Zhao had increased, reaching the threshold of “not believing others' negative comments about her.”
 

 
“One moment he’s all over the place,” one female staff member said, puzzled, “He Shun wanted to be alone with Tong Zhao, but she didn’t give him that chance. He feels regretful, yet his favorability increased? Can someone explain this from a man’s perspective?”
 

 
A male screenwriter tried to relate and found he felt the same way: “Men often take advantage of any chance they get. It feels good to benefit from a girl, but they will only really like a girl who values herself and has principles… Plus, when the chance to be alone does come, it feels even more rewarding! If it were me, I’d start looking forward to the opportunity to be alone with Tong Zhao from this moment on, and would be very willing to go out of my way to win her approval.”
 

 
The lighting technician said, “Thanks, that made me feel a bit cheapened.”
 

 
Wei Zekai and Han Zhi were left alone.
 

 
Han Zhi was reading in the room, while Wei Zekai, who had been playing video games on the sofa, dozed off with his head tilted, setting an alarm for the night before he fell asleep.
 

 
After all, he had drawn the "Dare" card and had to cook dinner with Miss Chang.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite troubled.
 

 
His peak cooking skills in this lifetime were during the heyday of games like Cooking Mama and Kitchen Nightmares. His culinary prowess in the games was impressive, but in reality, he was rather clueless.
 

 
Fortunately, Tong Zhao and Han Zhi were in the same group; they were both quite straightforward, so he could relax.
 

 
Otherwise, he would really be in a bind.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was also very worried.
 

 
She thought about it and decided to consult Han Zhi, who was known for his excellent cooking. He carefully taught her two quick dishes and was even more easygoing than she had expected.
 

 
However, by the evening, Chang Xiaonian’s worries came true.
 

 
She asked Wei Zekai to assist her. He was quite obedient, rolling up his sleeves without a word and getting to work. While she handled other ingredients, she turned around to find that he had turned the onions into onion paste.
 

 
“……”
 

 
Wei Zekai's handsome eyebrows were filled with pride. “My knife skills are pretty good, right? Who wouldn’t say that’s impressive?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian opened her mouth and then, with restraint, closed it.
 

 
“I’ll handle this. You go help me cook the rice,” she instructed gently.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just tested his knife skills, found cooking somewhat interesting. He thought that such a simple task seemed beneath his talents, but given that it was a request from a girl, he decided to go to the rice cooker after washing the rice.
 

 
Wei Zekai carefully rinsed the rice.
 

 
Seeing his reliable actions, Chang Xiaonian felt a bit reassured.
 

 
When she finished preparing the dishes and went to serve the rice, she opened the lid and saw a pot of...
 

 
Stir-fried rice.
 

 
The grains were distinct, and the rice was stuck together, occasionally forming clumps, resembling cat litter.
 

 
……
 

 
“Wei Zekai,” Chang Xiaonian exclaimed in shock, “Did you cook the rice without adding water!?”
 

 
What kind of mistake is this?
 

 
Wei Zekai was even more shocked. “You have to add water when cooking rice!?”
 

 
With no other option, Chang Xiaonian had to add water and cook it again.
 

 
The rice that came out of this second cooking was wet on the outside but hard on the inside, with a very poor texture. When Wei Zekai took the first bite, he almost spit it out but managed to swallow it only because it was his own work. The others looked at Han Zhi with a hint of longing for the meals he prepared but didn’t say anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao took two bites and then put down her bowl.
 

 
The AI captured her thoughts:
 

 
[Just because there’s rice in the bowl doesn’t mean it can be called rice. This bowl should be called carbohydrates at most.]
 

 
“I’ll meet you in the pottery room at eight. I’m going to take a walk to digest,” she said, glancing down at her bowl and chopsticks with a troubled expression. Han Shun immediately offered, “Go ahead, I’ve eaten enough. I’ll wash your dishes for you.”
 

 
Such a casual offer.
 

 
To Chang Xiaonian, Han Shun had already become a complete “simp.” She couldn’t help but feel a bit of sympathy for the gentle and handsome guy who would be alone with Tong Zhao to do pottery later.
 

 
I hope that after coming out of the pottery room, there won’t be another "simp" in the manor.
 

 
But it doesn’t really matter now.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was feeling quite distressed.
 

 
She had no romantic experience, loved reading novels, and read many Taiwanese pocketbooks during school that featured stories about campus princes falling in love. After starting work, she read a lot of stories about perfect relatives slapping faces and green tea bitches, learning about human relationships from novels, with no real-life opportunity to interact with a big shot.
 

 
She joined this activity with high hopes and felt that Wei Zekai was just like the campus prince she had imagined when she arrived at the manor.
 

 
Although he had a poor attitude, was absorbed in playing games, and seemed disinterested in women, he was rich and handsome. Wasn’t he the perfect leading man?
 

 
Unexpectedly, when she finally got a chance to be alone with him, she found out—
 

 
How could this guy be so clueless?
 

 
Wasn’t a prince supposed to excel at everything effortlessly?
 

 
And it was just cooking rice!
 

 
Miss Chang looked resentfully at the sofa, only to find that the previously lounging Wei Zekai was nowhere to be seen.
 

 
---
 

 
At exactly eight o'clock, Tong Zhao pushed open the door to the pottery studio.
 

 
The walls of the studio were decorated with rows of hanging ceramic artworks. The table was equipped with a full set of pottery tools, and the pottery wheel was small and delicate. Han Zhi was already seated, glancing over at her with evident anticipation. The bright light in the room and his gaze created a relaxing and comforting atmosphere.
 

 
He was the kind of man who made it easy to let down one's guard.
 

 
"Have you been here long?" she asked.
 

 
"Just arrived," he said. "I wanted to see if there were any tutorials. I’ve already learned a bit of the basics," Han Zhi arranged the tools neatly like little soldiers and motioned for her to sit beside him. "It’s a bit challenging, but it’s quite fun, like playing with mud..."
 

 
As he spoke, he chuckled, "Because it is like playing with mud."
 

 
Preparing for a date in advance was already a step ahead of many other men.
 

 
What was even more impressive was how natural he made it seem, not treating it as an achievement to boast about but as a thoughtful gesture subtly integrated into the experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a seat beside him and then noticed him magically pull out a thermal box from beside the stool and push it in front of her. Inside the box was a sandwich with egg salad. "I made some extra for myself after dinner, and since you didn’t seem to have a good meal, I made a bit more. If you don’t mind, you can have some to fill your stomach.”
 

 
---
 

 
"Thank you. I really didn’t eat well; that meal was hard to describe."
 

 
She complained in a spoiled tone, like a young lady who felt entitled.
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up the sandwich and began to eat. The white toast was lightly toasted and still warm, likely made not long before.
 

 
While she ate, Han Zhi looked away and drew a cute chibi bunny in his sketchbook.
 

 
Tong Zhao, curious, asked, "Can you draw?"
 

 
"I was just looking at a tutorial that said pottery doesn't have to be about making cups; you can also make figurines. The coloring tools here are quite complete," Han Zhi said with a smile. "I didn’t know what to make at first, but when I saw you eating, I thought of making a bunny."
 

 
Tong Zhao, munching on her sandwich, paused and asked, "Do I look like a bunny?"
 

 
Han Zhi, though young and dressed neatly, had an inexplicable air of weariness about him, as if he had experienced many things and returned with a calm and gentle demeanor. It felt like if you threw a tantrum in front of him, you would only receive a tolerant look.
 

 
Such a man would be classified as an “older man” in books targeted at middle school students—
 

 
---
 

 
In romance novels, the male lead is often considered youthful, and by the age of twenty-eight, he's already called "uncle," akin to a twenty-three-year-old eSports veteran.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Han Zhi, for the first time since Tong Zhao entered, stared at her intently.
 

 
Though he only maintained his gaze for about five seconds before looking away.
 

 
"It shouldn’t be like that; I just suddenly thought of it."
 

 
---
 

 
This was different from the initial expectations of the show’s crew regarding the "player" scenario.
 

 
Han Zhi, holding the "Writer" identity card, didn’t say any elaborate romantic lines to her. Even now, he didn't climb the ladder to praise her for being as cute as a bunny.
 

 
The production assistant pondered, "Even if Han Zhi is a top-notch handsome guy, pretending to genuinely praise a girl he just met as being like a little bunny… that’s pretty cringy! I’d rather he stayed silent and be a mute handsome guy!"
 

 
The men in the crew didn't understand.
 

 
Women’s definitions of what is cringy are indeed hard to grasp.
 

 
Yet, Han Zhi managed to control that line perfectly.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished the sandwich, the large screen in the ceramics studio displayed the task requirements for completing the adventure: “Create three beginner-level ceramic pieces, one of which must be a joint effort.”
 

 
Han Zhi interpreted it: “So, we each make one ceramic figure, and then we collaborate on one to complete the task.”
 

 
“That’s about the idea.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a tissue to wipe her hands and began to sculpt a ceramic figure under Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
Though Han Zhi claimed to only know a little, his actual handling of the task was like that of a teacher.
 

 
He could answer any questions Tong Zhao had immediately.
 

 
He was extremely skilled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him skeptically: “Is this really your first time doing ceramics?”
 

 
“Mm.”
 

 
Han Zhi answered, and just as Tong Zhao thought he would keep up the pretense, he suddenly revealed a refined and subtle smile: “This kind of thing… At the beginning, when you bring a girl along, it might seem like you’re trying to hold her hand, which is too obvious. By the time the relationship progresses to that stage, it becomes cliché.”
 

 
His deep voice echoed in the quiet ceramics studio, like a sudden thunderclap.
 

 
Tong Zhao's breath caught slightly, and her heartbeat quickened.
 

 
She pondered: *Is he revealing his true self so quickly?*
 

 
Normal romantic interactions often develop gradually, and the excitement comes from less experience.
 

 
Even holding hands can make someone anxious throughout an entire movie.
 

 
For an experienced person, holding hands and whispering during a movie is quite natural. It’s either enjoyed together or, for a novice, a nervous attempt at routines they’ve seen done many times before. Excitement has a threshold, similar to how readers felt about time-travel novels when they first became popular. Authors could spend an entire chapter discussing life before the time travel and the reasons behind it, as there was still novelty.
 

 
Later on?
 

 
With ten, a hundred, or even thousands of time-travel and reverse time-travel novels…
 

 
The result is that readers become numb. Numbness aside, they still read. Just as with a sea king’s romantic embraces, even if many have experienced similar things, it doesn’t stop the action—it just isn’t as exciting anymore.
 

 
So, skip the guessing phase and get straight to the point.
 

 
To evoke romantic feelings in front of an experienced person, one must rely on surprise—
 

 
Han Zhi initiated the advance.
 

 
“So if you wanted to hold her hand, how would you do it?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t look at him, seemingly focused and interested as she molded the clay in her hands.
 

 
But she felt his gaze on her hands.
 

 
Her delicate, fair hands looked like snow against the clay.
 

 
“If you want to shape it like an ear, you’re doing it wrong,”
 

 
Han Zhi leaned closer, his lips near her ear. He reached out to correct the clay doll’s ear, his large, defined hand close to hers but deliberately avoiding direct contact.
 

 
He smiled and asked, “I’m also struggling with this issue. How about you teach me?”
 

 
His deep voice carried a hint of laughter, with a languid undertone of unspoken desire.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but lift her eyes to glance at him, as if she had misheard his leading question. Under the bright lights, his demeanor was calm and composed, yet an ambiguous tension lingered between them, a distance close enough that one could easily pull the other into an embrace.
 

 
First, she steered the conversation back to a more serious topic, and once the distance was closed, she maintained a serious demeanor.
 

 
As she began to imagine, he provided further subtle cues for continued flirtation…
 

 
In terms of pure desire, Han Zhi was indeed a master.
 

 
What was he troubled by?
 

 
Whether it was about how to hold a girl’s hand or how to mold clay?
 

 
Tong Zhao, stirred by his teasing, took his hand in hers.
 

 
“Do I really need to teach you this too?”
 

 
She looked up at him, her pale eyes filled with irritation from being teased, making her look particularly fierce—different types of men have corresponding strategies, and in Tong Zhao’s eyes, both Han and the current flirt were in need of discipline and correction. The difference was that pretending to be innocent with Han Zhi was useless; a harsh approach was needed for a seasoned flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao curled her lips into a cold smile and spoke in a soft, seductive tone, “Zhi-ge.”
 

 
These two words seemed to have magic. After she spoke them, both "sea kings" were momentarily stunned.
 

 
He felt that this term of address seemed strangely familiar…
 

 
In a moment of relaxation from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao took the opportunity to assert herself. She smeared the clay-covered hand across his exquisitely handsome face and teased, “The only thing about me that resembles a rabbit is that I’m particularly capable. Aren’t you curious to try it?”
 

 
As soon as she said this, she pulled back, clearly indicating she was just teasing and ready to leave.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly reacted and grabbed her wrist to hold her in place.
 

 
Facing Tong Zhao's fierce gaze, Han Zhi’s heart raced even faster than before—
 

 
He wasn’t mistaken; Tong Zhao was indeed not the innocent, delicate flower she appeared to be. Her true nature was that of a domineering, arrogant beauty, and her inherent beauty carried a strong aggressive force when revealed.
 

 
This was also related to the era’s background.
 

 
In the feudal era, the Imperial Concubine Chen was like a red silk sleeve tied around the emperor’s neck—a kind of dominance that was still soft and charming. The emperor’s emotions were under her control. Without the emperor's authority to suppress her, the Imperial Concubine Chen’s imposing presence felt as though she might stomp on his face with her high heels at any moment.
 

 
Han Zhi’s gaze lingered on her rosy lips, his heart stirred deeply.
 

 
“Why? Not letting go?”
 

 
Tong Zhao squinted, ready to turn hostile at any moment.
 

 
“Not really willing to let go.”
 

 
Han Zhi admitted candidly, and in the next instant, he decided on his strategy. His poetic features took on a vulnerable expression, his aura softening to appear harmless, like a gentle teacher. Before releasing her wrist, he leaned in and brushed his face against the small patch of skin she had smeared with clay.
 

 
Then, he let go of her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s pupils widened slightly in surprise. The unexpected touch had startled her, but her agitation calmed down… She tilted her head, using the back of her hand to wipe the clay off her cheek while scrutinizing Han Zhi.
 

 
He still looked obedient.
 

 
Just moments ago, they had almost crossed a line.
 

 
From boiling to cooling down, it only took a thought.
 

 
After a brief pause, she curved her lips into a playful smile and complimented him, “Quick reaction—knows that I’m more responsive to gentleness than to force.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback by the praise, revealing a hesitant expression as if he had hit a sensitive spot.
 

 
“Don’t,”
 

 
Han Zhi’s eyes crinkled with a spring-like smile, “I can be quite assertive too.”
 

 
“Forget it,” Tong Zhao sneered, diving back into her pottery project with much more force, making it seem like she was trying to crush the fox doll’s head: “Do you think I’m like Chang Xiaonian? Someone who likes domineering CEOs?”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t respond.
 

 
He wouldn’t criticize another girl in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
“I get irritated when I see men showing off in front of me. Damn it, I can’t stand pretentious people,” Tong Zhao roughly shaped a crude fox doll. Her craftsmanship had always been average; previously, the pouches she made for the emperor were all done by palace maids. She was more like a project manager. After finishing the doll, she added, “Oh, except for myself.”
 

 
Han Zhi listened quietly while finishing his own piece.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at his wheel and noticed a bunny doll with a puffed-out face, much more delicate and beautiful than hers. She raised an eyebrow, “Is this how you see me?”
 

 
“Temporarily, yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi met her gaze calmly, not planning to back down this time.
 

 
[I’ve realized, this is a particularly difficult woman.]
 

 
[Being too domineering and tough won’t work; she’ll turn hostile. Acting meek and weak will just get her to look down on you. Objectively, apart from her top-notch beauty, she has many annoying personality traits. In front of someone like He Shun, she still has the interest to put on a show, but it won’t last long. Once the other person falls deeply in love with her, her true nature will be revealed.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed with a detached mindset.
 

 
---
 

 
In the production team:
 

 
The lighting technician clicked his tongue in amazement: “From Han Zhi’s inner monologue, it looks like he and Tong Zhao have no chemistry at all?”
 

 
The scriptwriter gave him a look: “It’s obvious he hasn’t been in a relationship. The sexual tension between them is so strong that I suspect if it weren’t for the restriction on explicit content... but then again, considering Han Zhi’s true identity, it’s a bit complicated.”
 

 
---
 

 
[Cynical, domineering, capricious, self-important...]
 

 
[If we were to sketch her personality, Tong Zhao would certainly be full of flaws.]
 

 
Han Zhi thought, giving her a provocative smile: “If you don’t want to be a prickly little bunny, then show me your other strengths.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him with curiosity, thinking he was a master of adaptation, and quite a cunning old fox.
 

 
[Let me see what other tricks you have—]
 

 
With this passionate thought, she grabbed his arm and pulled him towards her, kissing his lips forcefully.
 

 
Tong Zhao's actions were so intense that they knocked over the recently made ceramic figures.
 

 
The ugly fox was pinned down by the aggressive rabbit on the table and couldn't get up.
# Chapter33
"Congratulations to both of you for completing the adventure task!"
 

 
After these words appeared on the electronic screen in the ceramic studio, they heard two beeps, and the previously locked door automatically opened. Tong Zhao placed the two ceramic figures on the shelf, deliberately keeping them far apart from Han Zhi's work—
 

 
It’s not about not knowing the goods, but fearing the comparison.
 

 
Even someone as proud as Tong Zhao had to admit that her ceramic fox was poorly made.
 

 
Han Zhi asked, "Why place them so far apart?"
 

 
"Don't you have any discernment? Seems I overestimated your emotional intelligence."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled, and after tidying up the tools, he moved next to Tong Zhao and took the liberty of placing the two figures, which were originally far apart, facing each other, as if the little fox was bowing to kiss the rabbit.
 

 
Tong Zhao expressionlessly took the ceramic cups they had made together and turned them upside down over the two ceramic figures, covering them completely.
 

 
To anyone looking at the shelf, it would only appear as an overturned ceramic cup.
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned, then laughed, "A bit envious—they get to do things that can't be seen by others."
 

 
...
 

 
What are you saying, you old pervert!
 

 
Tong Zhao was surprised and gave him a look.
 

 
Just a moment ago in the ceramic studio, she had kissed him non-stop, making his pale lips redden, and now there was still a trace of that red. Tong Zhao chuckled, "You’re going to watch a movie with glasses girl later, right? Remember to wipe off the lipstick on your mouth. Women are very sensitive to colors; she’s been watching me closely and has a visual memory of the lipstick I use."
 

 
It's also strange.
 

 
Zhong Muxi seemed to pay more attention to her interactions with He Shun than to Han Zhi.
 

 
"Don't wipe it off. It looks good," Han Zhi said casually, as if he didn’t care.
 

 
Going to a movie with another girl while sporting a woman’s lipstick marks?
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but pinch his cheek, "Where did you come from, you trendy non-mainstream guy?"
 

 
"Then help me apply it more evenly.”
 

 
Han Zhi took the opportunity to lower his head and kiss her lips. Tong Zhao, still wanting to speak, found her tongue gently claimed by his, like a fox nibbling at a fish cheek, tenderly swirling around. They didn’t close their eyes, almost falling into the depths of each other’s gaze. The kiss was passionate, yet their physical actions remained restrained—no embraces, no crossing lines, which made one relax involuntarily.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t stand his ease and bit his tongue lightly.
 

 
When he released her, the lipstick marks on his lips were indeed blended naturally.
 

 
"See, it’s all good now."
 

 
Han Zhi lazily squeezed her hand before letting go.
 

 
"Nice technique. Let’s continue next time."
 

 
Han Zhi put his hands in his pockets. "I’m already looking forward to it."
 

 
Tong Zhao stuck out her tongue at him with a victorious grin and turned to leave. After she left, Han Zhi headed toward the kitchen on the first floor. Only half an hour remained before their scheduled 10 p.m. movie date, and he didn’t have much time left.
 

 
*
 

 
There was a mini-theater in the basement of the estate.
 

 
The entire wall was covered with a screen and a projector, with walls on either side filled with film options. These packaged film rights were cheap, but to save even more money, the "Aquaman Kill" program had filled it with old, outdated movies.
 

 
Zhong Muxi arrived early, wandering in the corridor outside the basement entrance twenty minutes ahead of time, pacing back and forth like a ghost.
 

 
She was so nervous just thinking about watching a movie with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
When Han Zhi arrived, he happened to see the bespectacled girl peeking around.
 

 
As their eyes met, Zhong Muxi froze completely.
 

 
She lowered her gaze, avoiding eye contact, clutching her skirt with a sense of self-consciousness.
 

 
Han Zhi acted as if he didn’t notice her awkward and distant behavior and approached with a smile, inviting her, “Shall we go in together?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi responded with a soft "mm," keeping her head down as she entered the mini-theater.
 

 
After they walked in, the door behind them was locked with a beep.
 

 
Zhong Muxi shivered slightly.
 

 
“No need to be nervous. The lock will open once the adventure task is completed,” Han Zhi explained casually, looking around the theater. “The restroom is right next to the screen.”
 

 
“Oh, I’m not nervous,”
 

 
Zhong Muxi attempted to joke, “I look so harmless, there’s no need to worry.”
 

 
It’s actually Han Zhi, a handsome guy like him, who should be worried about his personal safety!
 

 
Han Zhi, fiddling with the projection equipment, didn’t turn around and replied casually, “You’re saying that because you’re nervous. Don’t worry, I’ve prepared some things to help ease your nerves.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
Han Zhi had selected a few movies he had seen and thought were good for her to choose from. After checking the running times, she picked the shortest one.
 

 
After the movie started, Han Zhi sat down in the seat next to hers, leaving one seat in between.
 

 
This action made Zhong Muxi, who hadn’t had high expectations to begin with, display a moment of embarrassment. It was quickly hidden by her glasses, but she could already foresee how difficult the next hour would be. The thoughts AI captured were like spilled black mud…
 

 
[“I’m sorry, I didn’t want to draw this either. It would be much more enjoyable to watch a movie with someone like Tong Zhao or Xiao Nian, who are cheerful, beautiful, and cute. I shouldn’t even be here; I can’t even have a proper conversation, and I can’t even manage to be a good companion for watching a movie and joking around. I can only awkwardly lower my head, trying to lighten the mood with a joke, but it ends up being neither funny nor timely.”]
 

 
“You can’t watch a movie without this.”
 

 
Han Zhi magically pulled out a large bowl of caramel popcorn, wrapped in plastic wrap, and a serving of soufflé in an insulated box from his backpack, placing them on the seat between them.
 

 
There was only one serving.
 

 
“You mentioned you like cake during Truth or Dare, but there was no time to make a proper cake. I’m afraid this will have to do,” Han Zhi said, unwrapping the plastic wrap, and grabbing a handful of popcorn while watching the screen. The caramel was homemade and still gave off a rich, sweet aroma even after it had set.
 

 
“Oh, right, there’s a spoon too.”
 

 
Han Zhi, as if remembering it belatedly, took out a silver spoon from a cutlery box in his backpack and handed it to the dazed Zhong Muxi before continuing to watch the movie.
 

 
By the time Zhong Muxi realized it, she was already eating the soufflé.
 

 
The sweet, soft taste spread across her lips and tongue, effectively easing her nervousness. Throughout, Han Zhi didn’t turn to look at her, giving her plenty of time to adjust.
 

 
Although he didn’t look at her, Han Zhi was mentally profiling her:
 

 
[This type of girl can be pressured. If you’re a bit tougher with her, she’ll listen. She’ll just think she’s not doing well enough and will follow her boyfriend’s commands in her anxiety... That doesn’t fit my aesthetic; it feels low-grade.]
 

 
[Zhong Muxi is like a flower encased in ice. If you smash it onto the ground, the ice won’t protect the flower. If the goal is just to get the flower, it doesn’t matter how many petals break. But you could also choose to melt the ice with warm water, so the flower remains unharmed.]
 

 
Han Zhi chose a good movie.
 

 
He shared his thoughts with her intermittently.
 

 
Gradually, Zhong Muxi began to respond to him, becoming more relaxed as she spoke.
 

 
As they talked, she confessed, “I’m really sorry. It’s probably better to watch a movie with any other girl than with me.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was accustomed to seeing herself as a joke.
 

 
Now that she was so relaxed, her words carried a hint of sadness and apology.
 

 
Zhong Muxi felt that her mediocrity was a disservice to Han Zhi.
 

 
Her current self-doubt made her feel deeply apologetic towards herself.
 

 
Han Zhi paused. Turning his head from the screen, he gazed steadily at her:
 

 
“I enjoy watching movies with you. It’s rude to compare you with others,” he said, his tone softening as if he realized his previous words were too harsh. He lowered his eyelashes, speaking in a voice as gentle and soothing as if comforting a child, making her eyes well up: “Even though you might not see me as a potential romantic interest, please don’t bring up other people when we’re watching a movie together, okay?”
 

 
Previously, Han Zhi had deliberately avoided eye contact, minimizing his presence.
 

 
Now, their eyes met suddenly, and his movie-star-level face filled Zhong Muxi’s entire vision. She stared at him, only hearing the sound of her own heart pounding—because of his previous understated and subtle approach, this direct and heartfelt statement was all the more stunning and impactful.
 

 
Who could resist a handsome guy speaking romantic words?
 

 
Zhong Muxi's tongue twisted, and after obediently agreeing, she could no longer focus on the movie.
 

 
Because she realized…
 

 
In Han Zhi’s eyes, she didn’t seem very “safe” either.
 

 
This realization made her a bit happy, as if, due to his special attention, she was once again classified as a “girl.”
 

 
After that, Han Zhi didn’t say much more, and their conversation remained solely about the movie.
 

 
After the movie ended, he escorted Zhong Muxi back to her bedroom door and left.
 

 
His gentlemanly manners were taken for granted.
 

 
What kind of playboy do people imagine?
 

 
A whirlwind of romance, the kind of romantic gestures that dull, straightforward men couldn’t conceive… Han Zhi could achieve that. But rather than simply breaking through defenses, his interest had shifted. He hoped the young girl could rediscover herself by falling for him. He moved slowly, relaxed, and left ample space for poetic imagination, aiming to revive the once stagnant heart that had become a dead pool in the mundane and ordinary life.
 

 
The excitement was the first gift he gave to the glasses-wearing girl.
 

 
---
 

 
That night, after falling asleep, everyone woke up in the holographic filming pod.
 

 
Under the intense variety show shooting schedule, guests must complete the legally mandated amount of exercise during their limited waking hours before they can continue with the filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao rubbed her dizzy head and went to the gym to do warm-up exercises and run.
 

 
She happened to run into the director, who came to check on everyone.
 

 
"The first episode will air soon. I can’t wait to see the audience’s reaction," the director said. Noticing her indifferent expression, he remembered, "Ah, your memory from the variety show hasn't returned yet, right? Don’t worry, your performance as both yourself and your other self was great. All the girls in our production team are completely captivated by Han Zhi."
 

 
"Thank you, director."
 

 
Tong Zhao thanked him.
 

 
She wasn’t surprised at all.
 

 
"But the others still don’t know that a guest is missing. For the sake of the show, please keep it confidential for now. We plan to reveal Han Zhi’s identity only after the entire season airs," the director said in a lower voice.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the director happily greeted the other guests who were arriving at the gym.
 

 
Duan Ge: [What did Han Zhi do on the show?]
 

 
Han Zhi: [I can’t remember at the moment.]
 

 
[I’m also quite curious,] the gentle voice of the Imperial Concubine Chen said with a hint of annoyance, [You must have done something to me on the variety show. I’m a bit irritated whenever I see you now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Maybe he did.]
 

 
Duan Ge & Han Zhi & Imperial Concubine Chen: [?]
 

 
……
 

 
The pre-launch activities were well done, and with anticipation all over the internet, the first episode of “Sea King Killer” is about to air.
 

 
In the pre-show clips, one of them features a solo performance by the mysterious amateur male guest, Han Zhi.
 

 
BGM: “He Was Just Passing By”
 

 
The footage, from the tired glance upon entering the estate to his silent self-introduction, exclusively features shots where he is not smiling. It must be said, while his warm guy style is quite charming, the mysterious and cool image of him in the edits arouses even more curiosity among female netizens.
 

 
— “Sorry, I’m a bit late,”
 

 
— “Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ for persistence.”
 

 
The background music reaches the chorus part with the lyrics “Everything is just brushed over…” and the beat, showing his dangerous and sexy side in front of Tong Zhao. It freezes at the moment their lips are about to touch and, just as viewers' emotions and curiosity are at their peak, the screen abruptly turns black, quickly displaying the program's official broadcast time.
 

 
This face, once conquering another world and becoming a top Eastern star, is now recreated in holographic virtual reality!
# Chapter34
Beauty is hard currency.
 

 
A face so handsome that it makes the audience gasp has a promotional effect all on its own.
 

 
The production team of the show "King of the Sea" has clipped many solo segments of Wei Zekai and Han Zhi, using them for pre-release promotion on major short video apps and Weibo. The young master, with his short hair highlighted in gold and brown, looks as aloof and proud as a cat, attracting a lot of older sister and mom fans who just want to pull this big boy into their arms and pat his head.
 

 
Han Zhi has the purest form of high-level looks and a strong presence.
 

 
Many netizens were shocked—
 

 
In an era of information explosion, no handsome man or beautiful woman goes unnoticed. As long as someone is good-looking enough, they can instantly become popular, even if they just appear on "1818 Golden Eye." However, with Han Zhi, they truly know nothing about him. New threads keep popping up on entertainment forums, yet apart from screenshots admiring his looks, there is no other information at all.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
This isn't just some average-looking guy on the street.
 

 
Han Zhi's face, as captured on camera, is filled with a star-like quality and a strong presence. Even when he first appeared exhausted, with water droplets clinging to his hair, it didn't diminish his dazzling aura in the slightest. He gave the entrance hall the feel of a runway show.
 

 
How could he possibly be a nobody?
 

 
Netizens began to discuss, and the search terms related to "Han Zhi" kept rising. Even those who do not follow the entertainment industry would be intrigued by posts on their Weibo homepage such as [Ahhh, I need to know everything about Han Zhi within three seconds!], [This batch of netizens is useless; it’s been an entire afternoon, and they’ve only managed to dig out Han Zhi’s name!], and [Waiting eagerly for tonight’s premiere of "King of the Sea"!]...
 

 
These kinds of posts have piqued people's interest in Han Zhi and the variety show.
 

 
At this moment, the entire Eastern internet is filled with curiosity about Han Zhi.
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans are also passionately speaking up, but their voices are quite divided.
 

 
[Ahhhh, she should never have gone on a dating variety show, TVT! Manager, come out and die!]
 

 
[Where did this pretty boy come from? Stay away from my Zhao Zhao!]
 

 
These are the "boyfriend fans" who are losing it on the spot.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who played a noble concubine overflowing with femininity, attracted a group of fans who adored her looks. They are quite resistant to her starring in a "strong female lead" movie like *Countdown: 72 Hours*, hoping she would continue down the path of playing charming, seductive women. But instead of getting what they were waiting for, they saw their goddess getting close to another handsome guy on a variety show—how could they not be devastated?
 

 
However, in an era where instinctual variety shows are rampant, this isn't uncommon.
 

 
What happens on these instinct-driven variety shows cannot be taken completely at face value.
 

 
So, most male fans remain steadfast: [As long as they don’t officially announce they're together after the show, she’s still my good wife. Enough said, I forgive you. *[insert meme of wearing a green hat]*.]
 

 
While the male fans are going crazy, the female fans are much more composed.
 

 
[I think this handsome guy and Zhao are quite a good match.]
 

 
[Wait a minute, I remember the rich second-generation heir on the show and the concubine are also good friends. A love triangle is in the works?]
 

 
[If you guys keep talking about this, I won't be sleepy anymore!]
 

 
Whether male or female fans, they at least have some vested interest in this.
 

 
The most pitiful one, however, is Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The top comment under this trailer's hot discussion tagged this poor "Emperor":
 

 
[Are you even human if you tag Song Wanzhuo after seeing the concubine kissing someone else? I already told you not to tag Song Wanzhuo, so why are you still tagging him? How do you think Song Wanzhuo would feel seeing this?]
 

 
Just as netizens were passionately discussing Han Zhi's divine looks, they suddenly remembered that in *Legend of Emperor Ming*, Song Wanzhuo's feelings toward Tong Zhao were rather unusual. Given that it was an instinct-driven drama, it's impossible to say he didn't feel anything at all. However, the two of them cut ties after filming, so this CP (couple pairing) didn’t really gain much traction.
 

 
But when this was brought up, the main person involved actually replied.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo: [Haha, my heart feels not the slightest ripple, and I’ll be watching the first episode tonight.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, here comes the muddle-headed emperor!]
 

 
[Dream crossover/dog head meme]
 

 
From the bottom of his heart, Song Wanzhuo genuinely believed that watching this variety show wouldn’t stir any emotional waves in him.
 

 
What he loved was the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming*, not Tong Zhao herself. Once the drama was over, the feeling wasn't quite the same. However, he does plan to watch the variety show *King of the Sea*, because he really likes Tong Zhao's looks. Like some male fans who adore delicate beauties, he also hopes Zhao Zhao will always remain beautiful, avoiding roles like Feng Yanqi’s, where she plays a fierce and dominant character...
 

 
In short, he’s confident and staying calm.
 

 
The appearance of the "Dog Emperor" (referring to Song Wanzhuo) turned the previously tense atmosphere into a sea of joyful banter and memes.
 

 
The first episode of *King of the Sea* premiered right on time.
 

 
The holographic screening rooms and online cinemas were packed with viewers.
 

 
Some audience members already had Tong Zhao's fan badge displayed next to their IDs, silently making their presence known.
 

 
For the audience, the introduction of the three ordinary participants felt like filler time, and they chatted and joked around in the bullet comments, not taking it seriously. The production team knew how important the beginning was, so they didn’t give them much screen time; after a brief introduction, the progress bar quickly moved to Wei Zekai’s entrance.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound effects of jingling coins, Young Master Wei stepped out of a luxury car.
 

 
A single line, "Is this it?" made the number of bullet comments surge.
 

 
When he later referred to the large room the guests were supposed to sleep in as "a worker's room," the audience couldn't help but sigh that they were not living in the same world as this young master. If this is considered a "worker's room" in the Wei family, how big and luxurious must the room he actually sleeps in be?
 

 
[This second-generation rich kid is too vivid, he's basically playing himself.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai, debut now! If you don’t get famous, you can always go back to your family’s billion-dollar business. *dog head meme*]
 

 
[Boohoo, that single "Is this it?" broke me, especially while I’m still paying off my mortgage.]
 

 
Some bullet comments explaining the background of Wei Zekai's wealthy family to viewers who were not in the know.
 

 
The thrill brought by the rich, handsome young man sustained the audience’s interest for a while longer.
 

 
However, the audience’s biggest excitement was still about when Han Zhi and Tong Zhao would make their appearances.
 

 
The waiting time for the guests was fast-forwarded at double speed, with a shortcut inserted of Young Master Wei playing a game. After losing three rounds in a row, he irritably spent four sets of 648 yuan on *Honor of Kings* and mumbled under his breath, "Spending money for good karma, hurry up and give me some decent teammates."
 

 
Until night fell, the manor outside was shrouded in a torrential downpour.
 

 
At this point, the editors skillfully played the horror movie soundtrack, as if this sweet dating show was about to turn into a murder mystery in a locked room. In this tense atmosphere of impending storm, there was a commotion at the door. Everyone turned to look—it was the much-anticipated appearance of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was her first time appearing on screen in a sweet and charming modern style.
 

 
Tong Zhao has been in the limelight recently, and it's about time the audience got used to her beauty.
 

 
But when she appeared in a pure white little dress, the director proudly gave her several close-up shots. Her slender and graceful figure was accentuated by the fitted waist design, creating beautiful curves. The combination of white socks and leather shoes added a touch of cute innocence—every aspect was soft and delicate...
 

 
The audience suddenly realized they still weren't tired of seeing this face.
 

 
Facing the gazes of the other guests, especially the dissatisfied look from Young Master Wei directed at the latecomer, she gave a slight apologetic smile. Her light-colored eyes were filled with a deer-like sense of panic and innocence—so pure, so delicate.
 

 
The bullet comments exploded instantly.
 

 
For a moment, it was a celebration by Tong Zhao’s fans who adored her looks—
 

 
[Ahhhhh, I love this look so much! Give the stylist a full banquet!]
 

 
[Sweet and soft little Loli, I’m in love! I declare that from now on, I’m a dad fan of Zhao Bao! *heart emoji*]
 

 
[Wait a minute, so my wife is going to kiss other men while looking this cute?]
 

 
A quick-handed fan excitedly swapped Tong Zhao’s innocent expression from her entrance onto the body of Yao, the Deer Spirit hero from *Honor of Kings*, and found it to be a perfect match—it was as if she was the real Yao Princess.
 

 
Before the “face-licking” fans could settle down, the narrator introduced the identity card Tong Zhao had drawn for the variety show—
 

 
["The King of the Sea" – "Female Student" Tong Zhao: It's often said that women are made of water, and she is certainly the sweetest femme fatale. Skilled at disguising herself, she can transform into any appearance you desire, like a black lotus flower drifting among men. At school, instead of focusing on credits and exam rankings, the male classmates care more about where they stand in Tong Zhao's heart. To win the top spot, they do everything they can to shower her with attention...]
 

 
[Can Tong Zhao achieve her goal, win this competition, and secure the prize money to treat her critically ill family member?]
 

 
The camera freezes right on the look in her eyes as she gazes at the male guests on set.
 

 
Hidden within is a desire to conquer.
 

 
...
 

 
Ah, Princess Zhao Zhao truly is a "black lotus."
 

 
At this moment, fans who started following her because of *Legend of Emperor Ming* went wild with excitement.
 

 
They love this kind of character setting so much!
 

 
Everyone is quite delighted.
 

 
Especially for Song Wanzhuo, who was watching in the holographic screening room, he was astonished to discover that when he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*, his once lifeless heart seemed to be called back to life, beating wildly—
 

 
What is this...
 

 
Is this the feeling of being moved?
 

 
It was clearly the same person, the same face, but when he met Tong Zhao in private, apart from appreciating her beauty, he never had this kind of heart-pounding feeling.
 

 
While confused, Song Wanzhuo was even more overjoyed.
 

 
It was like seeing his idol make a comeback.
 

 
He thought he would spend the rest of his life only watching edited clips of the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming* to get his “sugar rush,” but unexpectedly, he found that same feeling again in *King of the Sea*. Even though he couldn't figure out why, he couldn’t help but post on Weibo.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo:
 

 
Haha, my youth is back!
 

 
Although he didn’t explicitly say what he was referring to, considering he had mentioned earlier in the day that he was going to watch *King of the Sea*, and this happened to coincide with the time just after Tong Zhao's appearance, fans and onlookers immediately guessed that he was quite fond of Tong Zhao's new look this time. Ever since finishing *Legend of Emperor Ming*, he had gradually transitioned from being an idol to purely being an instinct-driven actor, and this kind of comment was still within his fans' tolerance range...
 

 
After all, there really wasn't any concrete evidence about the two of them.
 

 
Not even staged interactions for publicity; it was clear they were just a "plastic couple" who went their separate ways after filming.
 

 
However, the comments from female fans below his post were tinged with jealousy, gently reminding him—
 

 
[Brother, don’t go crazy. Think about the preview content.]
 

 
[Brother Wanzhuo’s reaction is exactly like a boyfriend fan from our fandom.] This comment was from a fan of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some more mischievous and sarcastic netizens gave him a blunt reminder: [Your Majesty, your beloved concubine is about to date another man!]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was happily watching the variety show when he saw this highly upvoted comment from a random viewer, and his smile instantly froze on his face.
 

 
Just then, Han Zhi made his appearance in *King of the Sea*.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was watching with bullet comments turned on.
 

 
As soon as Han Zhi appeared, aside from the excited shrieks from fans admiring his looks, there were a bunch of green bullet comments playing on a meme:
 

 
[Hats are being handed out, everyone, put them on in advance.]
 

 
What made things worse was that Song Wanzhuo’s earlier Weibo post had made it to the lower end of the trending list and was being reposted by numerous marketing accounts with laughter, which then synced up with the bullet comments from those watching at the same time—
 

 
[Dog Emperor, I know you’re watching. Make sure to keep your hat on.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s mindset instantly shattered.
# Chapter35
Song Wanzhuo used to be a skeptic about love developing from working together.
 

 
Although it's not uncommon for people to be influenced by in-movie emotions, he was known in the industry as a staunchly straight man, famously indifferent to romantic scenes. Even after filming *Legend of Emperor Ming* and clearing his reputation, he felt no flutter in his heart when meeting Tong Zhao in person...
 

 
So, he became a fan of Tong Zhao’s looks.
 

 
A very pure fan of her looks.
 

 
Unlike those boyfriend fans who call Tong Zhao their "wife," he was very noble.
 

 
Until he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*...
 

 
Forget about calling her "wife"—she was his beloved concubine QAQ!
 

 
In the past, during promotional events and movie screenings, he had plenty of opportunities to see her. Tong Zhao gave Song Wanzhuo the impression of a slightly aloof but polite beauty. Working with her was very pleasant, but no romantic sparks flew. As a hidden fan of her looks, it was perfectly normal for him to admire her beauty...
 

 
But at that moment, Song Wanzhuo realized his pure admiration had transformed.
 

 
He instantly upgraded from a fan of her looks to a boyfriend fan.
 

 
If it weren’t for the paparazzi discovering him and causing trouble for Tong Zhao, he would really want to change his phone's wallpaper to a picture of his beloved. Song Wanzhuo, thinking this way, casually took a few screenshots of Tong Zhao. His beloved concubine truly passed the test from every angle with her breathtaking beauty!
 

 
Her unedited photos are stunning!
 

 
A beauty in a golden age!
 

 
Remembering that this is a month-long dating show, Song Wanzhuo felt both envious and regretful.
 

 
If he had known earlier, he would have squeezed in time to join the show, even for free. Living with his beloved concubine—could it be called a loss? Probably not. The only issue might be that his manager would tear him apart. Moreover, *King of the Sea* wasn’t well-known before the trailer went viral. From any angle, it was unlikely he would be on the show.
 

 
Logically, Song Wanzhuo thought this way.
 

 
But emotionally...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s fingers flew across the screen, crazily posting in the bullet comments:
 

 
[I also want to help Zhao Zhao move her luggage!]
 

 
[Help! What an unbelievably cute profile, Zhao Zhao, please start dating me immediately!]
 

 
[Can’t understand what He Shun can do that I can’t. How can someone who helps her move her luggage not be me?]
 

 
You can’t imagine the happiness of being a boyfriend fan!
 

 
For Song Wanzhuo, who had just been promoted to a boyfriend fan, his happiness lasted less than five minutes.
 

 
To keep the show’s pace tight, after Tong Zhao went upstairs to freshen up, the show quickly moved on to Han Zhi’s appearance.
 

 
At this moment, VIP viewers with special privileges were even sending animated emojis.
 

 
What kind of animation?
 

 
It was the scene where Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were about to kiss.
 

 
In other words, Dog Emperor experienced everything from falling in love to heartbreak in just four and a half minutes, with a hint of being cuckolded, enriching his life experience all at once.
 

 
To make matters worse, as Tong Zhao finished freshening up and walked out of her room in slippers, she made eye contact with Han Zhi.
 

 
Before Song Wanzhuo had a chance to admire his beloved concubine’s cute, fresh look, he heard her voice expressing admiration for Han Zhi, which was in stark contrast to her pure and innocent appearance.
 

 
...
 

 
[Haha, the princess is too cute! Han Zhi is indeed exceptional!]
 

 
[Brothers who think they’re a good match, type “perfect match” on the screen!]
 

 
[Perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, calm down! They’re a natural pair of handsome guy and beautiful girl. How can you monsters oppose them? Tong Zhao didn’t debut as an idol, so calling her “wife” won’t get her attention. I suggest you learn to be a mother fan like me. Mommy loves you, and Mommy agrees with your early romance!]
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s heart was bleeding.
 

 
He couldn’t help but think—
 

 
Look at him, he’s handsome too, he could be exceptional!
 

 
However, after Han Zhi introduced himself, the bullet comments with green hat jokes were quickly overwhelmed by a tide of female viewers.
 

 
Even the audience was surprised by how quickly things escalated.
 

 
Every star who becomes big has, to some extent, a breakout moment.
 

 
It might be a glimpse of brilliance in their work.
 

 
It could be a random candid photo of a newcomer going viral.
 

 
Even a pre-debut bare-faced look could become a breakout moment; you never know.
 

 
The question is whether one can have such a moment and when it will arrive. No one can say for sure. Even the strongest marketing company can only try desperately and continuously, and the real breakout moment might come from an offhand remark like “It’s impossible to work,” or a candid bare-faced photo uploaded by an ordinary person, which spreads more than a professionally shot photo set done by top photographers, leaving the company frustrated.
 

 
And Han Zhi’s line:
 

 
“I’m Han Zhi, Zhi as in persistent.”
 

 
It was so surprisingly perfect and struck a chord with a large number of female viewers.
 

 
While the typical boyfriend fan mindset was shattered, Song Wanzhuo was not.
 

 
He was quite resentful.
 

 
To become a star, Han Zhi indeed has good looks. While his charm is different from his, Song Wanzhuo still felt he had a right to compete with Han Zhi. At the very least, he was Tong Zhao’s senior. If he were in a relationship with her, he could share resources and connections, offering her a lot of experience...
 

 
Just then, Tong Zhao was sitting on the sofa, drying her hair, and let out a small sneeze.
 

 
Her nose tip was red from rubbing, like a delicate little white rabbit that had been wronged.
 

 
It melted the hearts of the audience.
 

 
It was a direct hit for Lolicon fans!
 

 
Then they heard her, while glancing at Han Zhi, sighing internally: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
The extent of explosive moments in instinctive variety shows is always unpredictable.
 

 
In any case, the buzzwords [exceptional] and [sleep with him] were sure to trend.
 

 
The manager, seeing this scene, almost had a heart attack. He composed himself and consulted with the company about marketing strategies—after all, during the era of instinctive filming, they had seen all sorts of shocking comments. Since nothing really happened, they just needed to manage the narrative to avoid negative backlash.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s sigh hit a chord with many of Han Zhi’s newly arrived fans. They felt the same way, and the mainstream discussions on Weibo leaned towards this newcomer guest being incredibly exceptional, like a walking hormone.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo remained resolute.
 

 
After all, his Weibo also had countless female fans wanting to be with him, and he had received many explicit photos in private messages.
 

 
In terms of charisma, he shouldn’t be left behind.
 

 
Men are always so confident!
 

 
Soon after, the show featured Han Zhi preparing a full meal with limited ingredients.
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really didn’t know how to cook.
 

 
Sigh.
 

 
Fortunately, with the progress of the times and Tong Zhao not relying on selling romantic illusions to attract fans, male fans, while heartbroken, could still focus on posting self-deprecating comments like [I don’t believe it, I need to see them kiss with my own eyes], [What era is this! I don’t mind a polyamorous relationship QAQ], and [If worst comes to worst, I’ll switch to being a CP fan. I can do it]... and similar comments.
 

 
The audience thought this pair of handsome man and beautiful woman might fall in love at first sight.
 

 
Then they heard Tong Zhao, while smiling sweetly and softly, internally mocking Han Zhi, seeing through his true face as a scumbag playboy.
 

 
This AI-captured inner voice at least retained the interest of 30% of the audience.
 

 
"King of the Ocean" isn’t just a romance variety show; it includes elements that test both intelligence and emotional quotient. Viewers who are only interested in pure romance might not be drawn to the show from the introduction, leaving those who are excited about the clash between Han Zhi and the other contestants. When they saw Tong Zhao excessively praising this amateur male guest as if she had fallen for him at first sight, some viewers were disappointed, feeling that the main attraction was gone.
 

 
Who wants to watch a young girl being unilaterally dominated by a scumbag?
 

 
It doesn’t matter how beautiful the female guest is.
 

 
What’s exciting is the back-and-forth, the battle of wits and emotions.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s remark, "There must be a demon behind showing weakness; it’s just a ploy to sell a deep affection persona," struck a chord with the audience, resonating well.
 

 
They were hooked!
 

 
Thus, the audience honestly stayed tuned.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t disappoint; her subsequent inner thoughts continuously hit the smart AI’s sweet spots and were played one after another. She critiqued every male guest, behaving like a noble and picky beautiful cat, with humans offering various treats and services, yet not necessarily winning her favor.
 

 
If you ask why?
 

 
Ah, that’s the wonderful thing about the little cat—it’s inscrutable.
 

 
During filming, the production team thought Tong Zhao’s "true self" was too much of a green tea (i.e., manipulative), and that it might be off-putting if released. Male viewers couldn’t bring themselves to dislike her, given her stunning looks (field assistant interjects: "You straight guys probably can’t even see where she’s being green tea"), but female viewers’ impressions of her might have been significantly diminished…
 

 
However, the production team missed something.
 

 
From the omniscient perspective of female viewers, since this isn’t a serious pure romance show, they accepted Tong Zhao’s role as a scheming woman and even identified with her.
 

 
This sense of identification is the most lethal.
 

 
Who hasn’t dreamed of being a beautiful woman charming the world?
 

 
If you had Tong Zhao’s face, most people probably wouldn’t be dating ordinary men.
 

 
Even if it’s 1v1, it would be with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
So what if she’s picky?
 

 
She deserves it!
 

 
Female viewers identified with her perspective. A beautiful woman who is both clear-headed and rational, with high emotional intelligence—playing with a self-important man like He Shun is simply exhilarating.
 

 
A small portion of male viewers' dissatisfaction was drowned out by the mainstream wave.
 

 
[The real face of the green tea girl is indeed scary.]
 

 
[Wait until she turns thirty, and then others will be able to pick on her.]
 

 
[What kind of strange species are those who keep calling her a green tea girl on the bullet screen? Hurry up and block them. Our Zhao Zhao will still be a wealthy, beautiful woman who’s out of your league even after she turns thirty!]
 

 
The stricter the moral guardians are in real life, the more excited the audience becomes about the "immorality" in instinctive variety shows. After all, she hasn’t done anything wrong. She came to this show fully prepared to be a schemer and to be schemed against. A little bit of cunning, is she a green tea cat or what? Even the poop scooping job isn’t fit for losers!
 

 
The debate brought attention.
 

 
And the catalyst for ending the debate about green tea was a little puppy.
 

 
The dog was transformed by Wei Zekai.
 

 
The production team’s sensational move truly shocked the audience.
 

 
The key is that, according to the promotional material before the show aired, Wei Zekai was portrayed as the cat-like handsome man in the show—aloof and noble, like an expensive Siberian Forest cat, nearly twenty thousand per cat. Love it or leave it, and even if you buy it, it’ll give you a super fierce look.
 

 
Then he turned into a little dog.
 

 
The twist came so suddenly that it shocked the audience and left them astounded.
 

 
#LetHanZhiDebut# and #RichSecondGenerationDoesn'tActLikeAHuman# both trended on social media, with Han Zhi leading due to his exceptional looks, while Wei Zekai’s puzzled "woof" followed closely behind.
 

 
The passersby were quite amused.
 

 
The second-generation circle who knew Wei Zekai laughed uncontrollably.
 

 
Meanwhile, the Wei family elders, who had heard that their only son had invested in several entertainment industry projects recently, were not optimistic. They criticized him as an unfilial son and suggested he should have just donated the money to charity to save on taxes.
 

 
Despite their complaints, he was still the only child.
 

 
How could they not watch him on the show?
 

 
And upon watching, they saw their son had even changed species.
# Chapter36
The Wei family gathered together.
 

 
Wei Zekai had parents above him, and above them were his grandparents. His maternal grandparents also came from a scholarly family. Six people doted on him as their precious grandson, spoiling him to the point where he had a haughty attitude. No one in the Wei family was innocent in this. Fortunately, though the young master was arrogant, his nature hadn't been twisted; he was fundamentally kind-hearted.
 

 
Father Wei looked at Tong Zhao and felt she looked familiar. "Has this pretty girl been to our house before?"
 

 
He was busy with work and, even when he managed to come home, didn't have much to say to his son.
 

 
But Wei Zekai didn't have many friends—
 

 
His mouth was too sharp, and his emotional intelligence was even lower. The number of friends he could bring home was even fewer.
 

 
Tong Zhao was one of them.
 

 
"Xiao Kai brought her over to hang out before, and he also posted a group photo with his friends on Weibo," Mother Wei reminded him.
 

 
"Zesheng, what is this program about?"
 

 
Grandfather Wei didn't quite understand; he just saw his precious grandson transformed into a corgi. He hesitated and asked, "Is this a pet dating show?”
 

 
Mother Wei patiently explained, and only then did the old man understand.
 

 
The dating show was indeed a real matchmaking show, but their grandson was the pet.
 

 
On the show, there was also a bad woman and a bad man, and their grandson was responsible for exposing the two of them.
 

 
Grandmother Wei frowned as she listened. "Letting Xiao Kai take on such a responsibility? The director must not be thinking clearly."
 

 
"Isn't this show one of his investments? Maybe he paid for the judge position," someone speculated. The Wei family hadn’t watched the promotional videos for the show and didn’t know the roles were drawn randomly, so they assumed that their wealthy young master had paid a large sum to buy the role of the dog.
 

 
"Then he's not thinking clearly either," Father Wei concluded.
 

 
The relatives all nodded in agreement.
 

 
After watching the show for a while longer, seeing Wei Zekai's emotional and social intelligence almost hitting rock bottom, Mother Wei suddenly said, "I’ve always said this child takes after his father."
 

 
Father Wei sneered and shot back, "Are we resorting to personal attacks now? Why not mention how, when you were pregnant with Xiao Kai, you were supposed to eat more walnuts to boost brainpower, but you refused because you didn’t want to crack your teeth. You drank eight glasses of water a day, and it all went straight to our son's head."
 

 
"Heh.”
 

 
Both of them felt that if things continued like this, it would be difficult to solve the family's heir problem without having a second child.
 

 
While the immediate family members were whispering about whether this child took after the father or the mother, the audience, on the other hand, found that the rich second-generation kid turning into a dog was extremely adorable. The way he wobbled around on short legs, furiously wagging his little tail, was like a healing little angel. Especially when he cautiously hid away—it was turned into a bunch of reaction memes...
 

 
Unfortunately, Young Master Wei wasn’t a celebrity or an internet influencer, so there weren’t many places to use this set of reaction memes.
 

 
Only the comment section under his personal Weibo was flooded with them.
 

 
Originally, it was filled with trend-following jokes like "Young Master Wei, give us something." But now, it had turned into [Wei dog Watching Secretly.jpg], [Suddenly Transformed into a Dog.jpg], and [Wei dog, Light of Justice.jpg]...
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and his memory hadn’t fully recovered yet. When he opened WeChat, he was stunned.
 

 
Still groggy, he saw that his Moments and WeChat messages were filled with images of a silly corgi.
 

 
Young Master Wei didn’t like dogs—he was on Team Predators.
 

 
His dream was that one day, if keeping tigers as private pets became legal in China, he would keep one in his garden at home—after all, he could afford it.
 

 
He opened the WeChat group of the "Young Master Wei Charity Foundation"...
 

 
It was the group where he partnered with Tong Zhao for investments, and it was flooded with dog memes. Instantly, he was very annoyed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Stop using stupid dog memes. Use some normal ones.]
 

 
Heir A: [...]
 

 
Heir B: [...]
 

 
Heir C: [...Uh, well.]
 

 
By the time Wei Zekai realized that the stupid dog was actually him, it was already two minutes too late to recall the message.
 

 
When it rains, it pours. The joys and sorrows between people don’t always connect. As soon as Young Master Wei realized the situation and became furious out of embarrassment, his friends had already posted this chat record on Weibo to farm likes and shares.
 

 
Sure enough, the silly netizens laughed their heads off on the spot.
 

 
[Help, is this really the dog young master’s IQ?]
 

 
[If this show airs, the stock price of the Wei Group might drop by half. The future looks bleak!]
 

 
["Drop by half? My foot! As a dog fan, I hereby declare myself a spiritual shareholder of the Wei Group from now on. I heard that the Wei Group is a diversified enterprise? Has the big boss considered developing a pet product line as a side business? You’ve got a ready-made spokesperson who can work for free /dog head emoji/ dog head emoji/"]
 

 
Just as Young Master Wei was experiencing social death, the show "King of the Sea" aired the segment where the two contestants who drew the King of the Sea cards were confronting each other face-to-face.
 

 
The game hidden beneath the sweet atmosphere was shot like a movie, turning the variety show into something cinematic.
 

 
The director of "King of the Sea" didn’t have much filming experience. For a variety show, being able to edit and find highlights is enough. Not knowing how to create beautiful compositions can even be justified as "showing the real side"… In short, this director's skills were far inferior to those of "Legend of Emperor Ming," but the two contestants had great on-screen chemistry, and every glance they exchanged told a story.
 

 
The two disguised as "King of the Sea" seemed to drop their facades entirely in the pottery room—
 

 
But the AI smart system that captured their inner thoughts told a different story.
 

 
While molding a fox figurine out of clay, Tong Zhao was cursing the producers in her mind for being so inhumane: [Why can’t we do R-rated things? That’s the fastest way to expose a man’s true colors. Wouldn’t it be more straightforward to have him kneel under my bed and tell the truth?]
 

 
The audience nodded frantically in agreement.
 

 
Han Zhi's inner thoughts were filled with sighs: [So difficult to figure out. I've never seen someone like her before; it's hard to guess what she's thinking. Her face is also quite misleading. Hmm, it's tough to look her in the eyes; she's too beautiful.]
 

 
While thinking this, their gazes intertwined once again, lingering like an eternity in a single glance.
 

 
The air was filled with a sweet atmosphere that seemed like marriage was the only way this could end.
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel the intense attraction pulling them towards each other.
 

 
As their scenes played out, the number of viewers in the streaming room and the barrage of comments surged rapidly.
 

 
The backend provided the most objective and accurate data collection, analyzing the four most frequently appearing keywords: [I ship this], [driving], [ZhiZhao], and [ZhaoZhi]. This couple was so easy to ship that no additional marketing was needed; CP (couple pairing) fans were naturally born. However, this also brought about some conflicts.
 

 
Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—who would take the lead position?
 

 
When the main actors actually kissed, fans were in uproar—not just for sweet moments, but for clarity on the dynamic—
 

 
[Tong Zhao pulled Han Zhi over for the kiss; isn't it clear who's on top and who's on bottom?]
 

 
[I absolutely can't accept Tong Zhao being the bottom. Having Han Zhi dominate her? I'd rather pair her up with Wei dog.]
 

 
[How can love exist between different species?]
 

 
The Zhao-Zhi shippers felt that their beloved sister was a proper and serious star, while Han Zhi, no matter how handsome, was still a nobody.
 

 
On the other hand, the Zhi-Zhao shippers held onto their traditional beliefs, arguing that their “Brother Zhi” grabbed the back of her head and kissed her back, so why shouldn’t the man be in the leading position? Didn’t they sense the tons of testosterone emanating from Brother Zhi?
 

 
In the end, a highly upvoted comment was highlighted in red:
 

 
[Stop arguing. Would you mind if this ship had one more fan? I’m joining this family right away.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal fans felt a strong sense of crisis.
 

 
They were worried that Han Zhi might be a new rising star heavily promoted by some company, trying to ride on the popularity of their Sister Zhao. They quickly showed up to claim Zhao Zhao, saying “Not interested, don’t bring her into this,” subtly and overtly expressing disdain for the good-looking amateur.
 

 
Fan circles especially detest stepping on each other's toes, and the discussion area instantly turned into chaos.
 

 
At the same time, Xu Zhu was also watching “King of the Sea.”
 

 
Last time, her stepsister had caused her to lose a lot of face. Finally, the hype over her kneeling video had died down, but she also lost a lot of fans who came for her sweet image and "little princess" persona. The filming of "Star Selection Girls" had ended, and Xu Zhu, who debuted thanks to her backstage connections, was now bored at home with nothing to do. She spent her free time plotting to prevent her stepsister from going viral again.
 

 
There was no helping it—her stepsister was just too infuriating.
 

 
The audience was quite forgiving, and as a result, Xu Zhu attracted a new group of fans who enjoyed watching a "selfish diva." She also unexpectedly landed a film offer that aligned perfectly with the character of "Feng Sisi." Her resources were surprisingly good—truly absurd.
 

 
But Xu Zhu didn't want to take it.
 

 
She was fixated on wanting to be the "little princess."
 

 
Why should Tong Zhao get to play positive roles and rise to fame?
 

 
She couldn’t stand that her stepsister got all the benefits.
 

 
So, this time, with Tong Zhao risking it all on an instinct-based variety show, Xu Zhu kept a close eye on her, just hoping to see her sister cause a scandal out of the blue. When she saw Chang Xiaonian badmouthing Tong Zhao, calling her a “white lotus green tea b*tch”...
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she wanted to become a sworn sisters with Chang Xiaonian!
 

 
This must be the long-lost sister she was meant to find!
 

 
Finally, someone saw through her stepsister's true colors, and Xu Zhu's eyes welled up with tears.
 

 
However, the reactions on the bullet screen and Weibo once again nearly made her vomit blood in anger. Even when Tong Zhao was exposed as a manipulative flirt, the audience still liked her, thinking she was charming in her wickedness—a proud little kitten who deserved to be pampered and win in the end. Xu Zhu stared at the screen until her eyes were red, and at last, she glimpsed an opportunity to smear her stepsister's reputation.
 

 
The amateur handsome guy who got close with her stepsister became an overnight sensation.
 

 
Just like many of Tong Zhao’s fans thought, Xu Zhu suspected that things weren't that simple. She believed Han Zhi was very likely an artist that some company was planning to promote heavily. The more one knows about the industry, the less they believe in random fame.
 

 
Xu Zhu dared to be certain that Han Zhi hadn’t signed with any entertainment company only after using her connections with the Tong family to inquire multiple times.
 

 
He was truly just a regular guy.
 

 
A very, very lucky guy who participated in a mediocre show, created some incredible chemistry, and then garnered attention and a fan base that even many marketing companies couldn’t buy with money.
 

 
It was rumored that a wealthy lady who loved following celebrities took a fancy to him and spared no effort or expense to build a fan support club for him.
 

 
The fan support club, screenshots, beautified essays—everything was arranged.
 

 
Strangely, even though there was no company backing him, Han Zhi's fan base grew rapidly like weeds, with astonishing combat effectiveness, and soon it took shape.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t indulge in romantic fantasies, so her fan base was relatively calm and mature.
 

 
Han Zhi, however, was different. His persona on the variety show was that of a super flirtatious "King of the Sea.”
 

 
The fans Han Zhi attracted were mostly irrational, younger "girlfriend fans."
 

 
To put it bluntly, if even an ordinary girl like Zhong Muxi could get his "emotional charity," then these girlfriend fans—though not comparable to a female celebrity like Tong Zhao—could certainly compare themselves to someone like Zhong Muxi! "King of the Sea, notice me!"
 

 
Because Han Zhi's attitude toward Tong Zhao was different, his girlfriend fans naturally disliked her.
 

 
Anyone who opposed her stepsister was Xu Zhu's ally.
 

 
Xu Zhu immediately found this handsome guy pleasing to the eye. She took the opportunity to buy a large number of cheap internet trolls to mix into Han Zhi's fan groups and stir up trouble... After all, fan groups that have just formed are the most chaotic and fragile, unlike the more disciplined, established fandoms. This gave her a chance to exploit the situation.
 

 
[Why are you calling her "sister-in-law"? What happens on a variety show doesn’t represent reality, okay? Brother Zhi still doesn’t know his commercial value. Once he wakes up from the filming pod, he’ll realize that a whole world of opportunities is waiting for him.]
 

 
[Only older ladies would believe the scripts of instinct-based variety shows, hehe.]
 

 
[Is your idol unable to find a partner? Why do you have to pair her up with a new amateur? Taking Brother Zhi away, not interested.]
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi's girlfriend fans and Tong Zhao’s fans fighting fiercely, Xu Zhu smiled with satisfaction.
# Chapter37
With the help of the cheap internet trolls, Han Zhi’s fame became even more overwhelming.
 

 
What initially started as a fan frenzy composed of casual viewers turned into something commercialized once the trolls got involved. Xu Zhu didn’t care about the man named Han Zhi, but she wanted to use his girlfriend's fans to severely undermine her stepsister’s reputation. The more Han Zhi’s fans, the better; the more irrational and combative they were, the more damaging they would be to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Seeing the internet trolls she deployed stirring up trouble on Tong Zhao’s Weibo, Xu Zhu felt a sense of satisfaction.
 

 
Life was truly wonderful.
 

 
Just imagine, if at this moment another female star of the same age as Tong Zhao were in the spotlight, Xu Zhu would have to consider whether helping her might create a potential competitor.
 

 
But Han Zhi was a man.
 

 
No matter how much he was promoted, he wouldn’t become a stumbling block for Xu Zhu’s rise.
 

 
How could things be so perfect?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she was almost becoming a fan of Han Zhi.
 

 
With the paid trolls creating a buzz, Han Zhi managed to attract a huge amount of attention and traffic with just one episode of the variety show. His fans firmly believed that their idol was exceptional, with a bright future of boundless opportunities, and that Tong Zhao didn’t deserve him!
 

 
At the same time, within the production team of *King of the Sea*, they were discussing changes to the filming format with the guests.
 

 
There are two types of formats for instinct-based variety shows.
 

 
One is live broadcasting, like *Countdown 72 Hours*, and the other involves filming a set number of episodes in advance and then airing them, as is the case now. The former requires higher technical standards and is relatively more costly. *King of the Sea* only had Tong Zhao as a celebrity guest and was following a path of building reputation through a small-scale approach, but once the show aired, everything changed.
 

 
The viewership ratings soared from silver to gold.
 

 
The scenes of the two "Kings of the Sea" confronting each other were incredibly captivating. With additional marketing and hype, the show's viewership even rose to platinum levels.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, “Wasn’t the plan to proceed steadily? Does the live format need approval? Will it be timely?”
 

 
He had only a vague understanding of the entertainment industry and invested in *King of the Sea* primarily because of his good friend.
 

 
“Our show’s ratings have reached platinum level!” the director reminded him.
 

 
Wei Zekai hesitated, “So, what’s the difference?”
 

 
At this point, the director became excited.
 

 
“In terms of viewership ratings, black iron, bronze, and silver are one level, gold is average, and mainstream variety shows and dramas that are considered good quality in the industry are usually gold level... Platinum, diamond, and emerald are in a different league altogether.
 

 
“Reaching platinum ratings means we’ve hit the threshold for being nominated for annual awards. Sponsorships... before, we had to beg for them, but now it's their turn to seek us out. With the audience loving the show, everything is falling into place! The show is starting to make money!”
 

 
According to the data captured from the backstage, Tong Zhao was credited with the primary achievement.
 

 
In reality, Han Zhi's mysterious rise to fame was the main reason.
 

 
But since they are the same person, it meant Tong Zhao’s success was compounded. There was no more to be rewarded, only admiration.
 

 
As a result, the entire production team praised her endlessly, both internally and externally. Outsiders wanted to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao, but given her “true self” displayed on the show, which showed she was not only far from a saint but also quite scheming, they only ended up being showered with praise and flattery, no matter how much they inquired.
 

 
Firstly, Tong Zhao’s contributions were indeed significant.
 

 
Secondly, her easygoing nature and high level of cooperation.
 

 
“I always said that inviting Tong Zhao was a stroke of luck for you, Director. The show making money was only a matter of time; otherwise, would I have joined?”
 

 
The director passionately praised Tong Zhao, and Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up. He put his arm around the director's shoulder, and they became quite friendly.
 

 
He had only understood the part about “starting to make money.”
 

 
The project he invested in was starting to make money!
 

 
Tong Zhao was amazing!
 

 
The two hit it off immediately, and while hugging each other, they boasted, “Well, I think we don’t need any more sponsors. I have cooperation agreements with several companies, so I’ll take the lead. As for me, Wei Zekai, I may lack in other areas, but I’m never short of money!”
 

 
The director, though average in filming skills, was top-notch in handling relationships and skillfully made Wei Zekai very happy.
 

 
Not only did he agree to additional investment, but he also forgot about the matter of the production team turning him into a small dog.
 

 
With platinum-level ratings enhancing the show’s prestige and Wei Zekai’s generous support, the approval for live broadcasting was quickly granted. The *King of the Sea* production team hurriedly posted on Weibo to announce the good news.
 

 
@King of the Sea:
 

 
[Episode 3 will start airing in a live format under the emotional classification in instinct-based variety shows. The success of the show is closely tied to everyone's support, and we hope it continues to improve! PS: After the guest adjustments, filming will start tomorrow morning at 7 AM. The edited version will be released later. Users who purchased the live viewing rights can download it for free using the same ID, without needing to make another purchase.]
 

 
This announcement struck like a thunderbolt, and the comments on Weibo were filled with anticipation.
 

 
[Really? We can now admire the sister's beautiful face anytime, anywhere!]
 

 
[I checked, and *King of the Sea* has reached platinum level. Tong Zhao truly is a star-making machine. I remember the episodes of *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* that saw a surge in viewership also had her appearances, right?]
 

 
The program’s rating level is publicly accessible, and netizens came back to congratulate.
 

 
Only Han Zhi's fans started making sour comments.
 

 
[Some fans are too good at controlling the narrative. Are all the credits really due to her?]
 

 
[Please check the number of search terms. Han Zhi related to the show is also doing well. Our brother is low-key and doesn’t seek credit, but that doesn’t mean he should be invisible, okay?]
 

 
[The official account tagged all the guests but not Han Zhi. Please treat Han Zhi fairly.]
 

 
Fans are particularly sensitive to differential treatment.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the large number of onlookers under the official Weibo account, the two fan groups did not directly clash but each made sour remarks in their own comment sections. Han Zhi's fans felt that the production team was harsh on Han Zhi to promote Tong Zhao and expressed their sympathy:
 

 
[Yes, before the broadcast, Tong Zhao’s appeal was indeed needed, and we don’t deny that she should be thanked. I only learned about *King of the Sea* because of her. But now that Han Zhi has demonstrated his value, can’t the production team give him fair treatment? We’re not asking for special treatment, just fairness.]
 

 
[Is it possible that Han Zhi doesn’t use Weibo…]
 

 
[Are there really people who don’t use Weibo these days?]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, on the other hand, were relatively rational but still felt sorry for her from a different perspective:
 

 
[She put in so much effort to make the show a success, and yet she’s still being criticized. The princess is so unlucky.]
 

 
[It’s like tearing down the bridge after crossing it—very frustrating.]
 

 
[Have you noticed that there seems to be constant media manipulation to incite our fans to argue with those of others? Focus on your own side; who knows, by the end of the show, that person might become our brother-in-law.]
 

 
At this point, both sides were feeling a bit deflated.
 

 
The production team noticed the situation and was about to seek Tong Zhao’s opinion on whether to reveal Han Zhi’s identity in advance to prevent any further misinformation or deceitful behavior toward fans.
 

 
Before the director could make a decision, another issue arose.
 

 
Originally, male guest Lu Yiqi was released on bail for drunk driving, and upon seeing the show’s success and Han Zhi, who had replaced him, becoming extremely popular, he was dumbfounded. He was just a minor internet celebrity and had admitted his mistake in drunk driving, accepting missing out on a golden opportunity. But after seeing the rhythm brought by Xu Zhu’s hired trolls, claiming that Han Zhi had million-dollar endorsement deals waiting…
 

 
Without a manager to stop him and having no peanuts at home, Lu Yiqi, having drunk a bit too much, got emotional and started a live broadcast on Weibo to complain.
 

 
His popularity was low, but alcohol made him particularly bold. The topics he discussed were trending, and fans and curious netizens flocked to his livestream, pushing his small broadcast to the top ten in real-time trending.
 

 
“Yes, it’s my fault that I drank and drove. I accept the criticism; alcohol is truly not a good thing.”
 

 
“Can’t I have a day or two? Seeing the person who replaced me being so popular makes me really upset.”
 

 
“Stop criticizing me. I know I have flaws, but who is completely clean?”
 

 
"I was the one caught on the day of filming. Holographic variety shows are filmed for 24 hours straight. Every guest had to go through a medical examination and submit it for approval. It's fine if someone is temporarily absent, but not if someone is added last minute. I really don’t know what methods the production team used to add a new person at the last moment."
 

 
When people are distressed, their thinking can become skewed.
 

 
Lu Yiqi became increasingly frustrated as he spoke, even adding conspiracy theories: "I had prepared to apologize for delaying the shoot, but then Xiao Zhang told me everything was still going as planned... Illegal methods? I don’t think so. I just feel... they must have wanted to replace me all along! They just didn’t tell me."
 

 
"Look at the recent hot searches. The person who replaced me has a much stronger background than I do."
 

 
"I'm not confused. The person simply doesn’t exist. Damn it."
 

 
Lu Yiqi was taking it simply; he just couldn’t accept it.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s cheap hired trolls were eager to hype up Han Zhi, wishing he would become a top star by the end of the show.
 

 
Fans hadn’t started dreaming yet, but Lu Yiqi’s mentality had already collapsed.
 

 
The most painful part was not having had the opportunity; it was that he could have had it.
 

 
Lu Yiqi believed he could have been in that position too.
 

 
Fans of Han Zhi, who were mentioned in the live broadcast, flooded into the stream, took screenshots, and posted them in the comments. They made a collage with Han Zhi’s picture and wrote five big words: “[You can’t do it],” and “[Even without you, our brother is still popular].” Some fans also quoted Yang Li’s famous saying, “They look so ordinary, but they can be so confident,” to emphasize their main point—“You don’t deserve it.”
 

 
The competition with Tong Zhao’s fans was seen as positive and constructive.
 

 
It was really embarrassing to be overshadowed by an internet celebrity like Lu Yiqi, who relied on beauty filters to look handsome and was just riding the coattails of the show’s success.
 

 
The fans who were swept up by the hype from hired trolls felt that their idol was about to break out of Asia and looked down on Lu Yiqi, rejecting any association or comparison.
 

 
This wasn’t really an issue initially.
 

 
But someone pointed out a crucial detail—
 

 
Even with a fast approval process for adding people to the variety show, it would still take a day or two.
 

 
This is common knowledge in the industry.
 

 
So why does "Sea King Kill" have special privileges?
 

 
This isn't the first time someone has been bold enough to make such a move; at that time, the show’s production team chose to remove the temporary guest to maintain the overall situation. Delving deeper, if there were any dirty dealings, the show would have to keep adjusting and striving for survival.
 

 
Han Zhi’s recent popularity is undeniable, but his small fans weren't delusional enough to think the production team would sacrifice the bigger picture for him, and they were immediately panicked.
 

 
Xu Zhu's hired trolls didn't provide after-sales service and weren’t genuinely interested in promoting Han Zhi.
 

 
It would be better if "Sea King Kill" failed altogether; Xu Zhu would be willing to abstain from meat for a year in exchange for Tong Zhao’s failure. She would be delighted if Tong Zhao's career ended abruptly.
 

 
But that was just wishful thinking.
 

 
How could this be related to Tong Zhao?
 

 
She wasn’t the one breaking the law; if Han Zhi were removed, she would only be consolidating her achievements, which would actually benefit her.
 

 
However, just as Han Zhi's younger fans were anxiously in tears, like headless flies, someone they hadn’t even considered stepped forward.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
"I guarantee that Han Zhi’s appearance in 'Sea King Kill' is compliant with all regulations."
 

 
@Lu Yiqi only got one thing right: if he hadn't been so clueless, Han Zhi wouldn’t have appeared at all.
# Chapter38
No one expected Tong Zhao to step up and speak out.
 

 
At first glance, her post on Weibo seemed to be a clarification for the show.
 

 
But upon closer inspection, it carried more weight in protecting Han Zhi.
 

 
Since her debut, she had never publicly argued with anyone or engaged in drama. Her fans didn’t expect her to suddenly show her true colors and throw a jab at Lu Siqi. Han Zhi’s fans were also touched by how she stood up for him. Just as both fanbases were ready to rally behind her with cheers and support, they simultaneously began to think in the same direction—
 

 
Wait, could they really be dating?
 

 
After exiting the filming pod and regaining their memories, there was a high chance the two of them genuinely liked each other.
 

 
Amid the brewing undercurrents, the production team of "Sea King Kill" belatedly released some behind-the-scenes footage, along with an approval document.
 

 
With an official document, things became clearer!
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans’ eyes lit up; whether their idol was being backed by strong connections or was a legal figure, the former seemed much better.
 

 
However, some observant fans clicked to read the text more carefully and became even more puzzled.
 

 
The approval document wasn’t the “Long-term Instinct Film Crew Declaration” but rather the “Instinct Film Dissociative Identity Declaration (Supplementary)”...
 

 
Most casual viewers and fans don’t bother reading the text carefully. Instead, they chose to click on the easier-to-understand behind-the-scenes footage.
 

 
After a brief buffering period, the first thing that came up was an exclamation filled with shock and a strong curse:
 

 
“Damn it—Lu Siqi got thrown in jail? For what? Overusing beauty filters?”
 

 
In the busy backstage area of the “Sea King Kill” production, the entire crew had gathered, methodically adjusting the equipment. Through the monitoring window, you could see the filming pods lit with breathing lights and some of the waiting guests. Although the camera was a bit shaky and there was no timestamp, viewers quickly figured out from the rich visual information that this was shot right before “Sea King Kill” was about to start filming.
 

 
Upon hearing the news from the staff, the director's face changed dramatically.
 

 
“Oh no, he really can’t make it? Messing with our plans like this, what the [bleep], has he [bleeped—] himself? We already have few enough guests, and now we’re missing one entirely. What does the contract say—can we sue him for damages?”
 

 
“That’s not the main issue. The problem is that the filming pod we rented can’t be rescheduled.”
 

 
“If we wait for him, we’ll have to rent the pod again. If we proceed without him, the result definitely won’t be good.”
 

 
“I’m really fed up with this!”
 

 
When they learned that Lu Siqi had been caught drunk driving and sustained minor injuries, making it impossible for him to arrive at the filming site today, several core members started cursing. Even though the curses were bleeped out, their unanimous angry expressions made it clear to uninformed viewers just how much trouble Lu Siqi had caused everyone.
 

 
The viewers who initially wanted to criticize the production team also felt their anger subside a bit after seeing this.
 

 
This was truly an unexpected disaster for them.
 

 
The cost of a holographic filming pod is extremely high, not to mention the medical team on standby. With all the layers of approvals, it involves a lot of personal connections, money, and time, none of which can be wasted. Who among the working class hasn’t encountered this situation? After working hard to prepare everything, only to have it ruined by some idiot, leaving everyone stuck between a rock and a hard place.
 

 
What could they do?
 

 
As the background music filled with intense, heavy drumbeats, the sense of urgency spread throughout the backstage.
 

 
“I have a suggestion,” the modeler suddenly spoke up, “I think it might be the only solution right now. But if it fails, it could make things worse for the show, and she might not agree to it…”
 

 
“Stop keeping us in suspense! Just tell us already!”
 

 
The director urged him on.
 

 
However, the behind-the-scenes footage didn’t show the modeler’s explanation. Instead, the camera cut to the director, looking tense as he walked from backstage to the filming room, glancing around for someone. At this moment, Tong Zhao arrived on set.
 

 
The director quietly explained to her why the guest was absent.
 

 
Then he got to the most crucial part: “We could create another male model for you, as if you have the ability to change gender with this Sea King card in the variety show.”
 

 
At this point, the viewers’ eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Oh my god, this plot twist is mind-blowing!
 

 
Even casual onlookers without a stake in the matter were stunned, let alone the fans from both sides, who were so bewildered that they even forgot to control the comments. If they were whales, the ocean would surely echo with a resounding chorus of “What the hell!” bouncing back and forth like a "What the hell!" plaza.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage continued.
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed to this outrageous request and even rejected the production team's original conservative suggestion of “one person with two genders.” In the initial plan, they only wanted to create a male model for her without splitting her consciousness, which would have been safer for her.
 

 
Just like how Wei Zekai could transform into a dog and wouldn't appear in human and dog form at the same time, the male and female versions of Tong Zhao wouldn’t either. It was simply giving her the ability to switch identities and perform as both.
 

 
Tong Zhao willingly chose to bear a heavier burden by splitting her consciousness into two.
 

 
That's how Han Zhi came to be.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage recorded the birth of "Han Zhi" in fast-forward mode. He was created from a scanned projection of Tong Zhao's imagination. Such a split consciousness act, like that of Sun Wukong duplicating himself, couldn't simply be generated by forcing a random model into existence. A person's self-awareness is a highly sensitive thing; if a model were forcibly created and Tong Zhao's consciousness shoved into it, the version of her appearing in the instinct-based variety show would constantly question her own existence.
 

 
The higher the compatibility, the more natural it appears, and the more it resembles a genuinely real person.
 

 
Like the previous movie King who played two roles himself, it was the clever use of character settings that blended the points of self-doubt into the narrative conflicts.
 

 
Yet Han Zhi, this hastily made creation, somehow achieved 100% compatibility with Tong Zhao’s "true self.”
 

 
When the modeling was completed and half of Tong Zhao's consciousness was infused, the originally fast-forwarded playback suddenly slowed down.
 

 
The process of inserting a guest into the instinctive variety show often resembles scenes from an infinite-stream novel, appearing in places that wouldn't raise suspicion. This time was no exception. Han Zhi, neatly dressed, slowly opened his eyes in a high-end hotel elevator, and in that instant, his flawlessly handsome face was endowed with a soul.
 

 
Those gentle, melancholic eyes became the initial attraction for countless fans.
 

 
The astonished exclamations of "What the hell?" suddenly fell silent.
 

 
In the short behind-the-scenes video, viewers witnessed the birth of Han Zhi—a mistake born of an unexpected twist of fate. He does not truly exist, yet the moments that moved them were very real.
 

 
Being a fan is inherently both an illusory and very real experience.
 

 
Fans feel joy and pain for their idol's achievements and setbacks. A person who they will never have any real-life relationship with becomes one of the most intimate and important presences in their hearts, truly reaching the point of "Others laugh at me for being too crazy, I laugh at them for not seeing through it."
 

 
Girls have long been accustomed to what's fake.
 

 
The persona is crafted through marketing, and the face might be surgically enhanced.
 

 
It doesn't matter; their love is real—pure, passionate, and sincere.
 

 
To outsiders, stars are the moon, and fans are the sun.
 

 
When fans look at their idols, there is a light in their eyes.
 

 
Thus, these devoted followers lift them up to the pedestal, gilding them with a shining aura.
 

 
The ending of the behind-the-scenes video shows a Vlog that Han Zhi filmed after learning about his origin, unaffected by the identity card.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard clicks, a line of text appears at the bottom:
 

 
[Room decor personally chosen by "Han Zhi"]
 

 
The show’s production team always treated Han Zhi as an independent person, respecting his will.
 

 
This small detail made his fans feel a bit better.
 

 
After all, just a few minutes ago, they believed they were fans of a living, breathing person.
 

 
The spacious room's layout is simple yet avoids a cold minimalist style. The colors are subtle and elegant, with small potted plants adding green touches. Han Zhi, sitting in an ergonomic chair, relaxedly adjusted the camera and gave a gentle smile to the screen: "Hello, I'm Han Zhi."
 

 
This smile was so familiar—it was the very smile that captivated them at first glance!
 

 
Han Zhi was wearing a linen-colored trench coat over a beige T-shirt and sweater, giving off a more casual, everyday vibe compared to his appearance on the show.
 

 
The indoor light fell on his handsome face, softening his sharp features.
 

 
"How should I put this?" he mused with a gentle smile. "I just found out that I'm actually a person without a past. All the background and identity I had in 'King of the Sea' were created by the show's scriptwriters."
 

 
These should have been heartbreaking words, yet Han Zhi's voice carried a thick sense of amusement, a bit of indifference and resignation. While others might see him as suffering, he didn't feel that way and even found it quite fun:
 

 
"Now my memory is completely empty—oh, except for the part that belongs to Tong Zhao. Actually, I think it’s quite nice. Compared to false memories, this clean and straightforward feeling is better. I don't need to possess too much."
 

 
It's hard to imagine that such a calm and composed "true self" could be hidden within Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
Some handsome guys look stunning when silent, but the moment they start expressing their views, you wish they were mute.
 

 
Han Zhi isn't that kind of handsome guy.
 

 
Fans, in fact, want to hear more from him.
 

 
Even when talking about big issues, he speaks with a calm and gentle tone. When describing trivial details, he does so with a soft charm and delight. One can imagine that if such a person truly existed, whether as a lover or a friend, he could make an ordinary, mundane life sparkle.
 

 
Recently, Han Zhi's rapid rise to fame has made his fanbase increasingly aggressive.
 

 
In some shady entertainment companies, this is a goldmine.
 

 
The younger and more irrational the fans are, the easier it is to exploit them for profit.
 

 
Once the "fan-pitting" game starts, there's no turning back.
 

 
Unless the idol themselves steps in to stop it.
 

 
But when the idol themselves is just a puppet controlled by capital, or if they seek to profit from it, why would they speak up? Or rather, those who sign contracts and become products at the end of the assembly line have already had their vocal cords removed.
 

 
However, Han Zhi has no such concerns.
 

 
He said, "In the real world, the only people I have a real connection with are probably you all, who have recently gathered around me because you like me. Fame comes quickly and goes quickly; soon, you will forget about me."
 

 
Han Zhi took off his glasses, his poetic eyes filled with a gentle, unspoken sentiment.
 

 
"However, I hope that in the short time you like me, you won't be affected by negative emotions."
 

 
"If you love me, then love purely."
 

 
"Don’t neglect your family, friends, studies, or life because of your fondness for me. I hope that through your feelings for me, you can draw positive energy... When you don’t feel like memorizing vocabulary, think of me. When you don’t feel like living anymore, think of how I would feel sad."
 

 
With his distinctly jointed hand, Han Zhi gently pulled open the collar of his coat, as if opening up his heart: "See, I am not a living person. I have unlimited time to love every person who loves me. How does that saying go? ‘Brother only has you.’ Yes, that's right. So, before you love me, love yourself a bit more."
 

 
He joked about his identity and revealed a smile as if he had thought of something pleasant.
 

 
When Han Zhi isn't smiling, that face is almost too perfect—so handsome it borders on cold.
 

 
But when he smiles, the glacier melts in an instant.
 

 
"If I can add a touch of color to your life, that would be an honor. I am very happy."
 

 
When the video ended, it automatically transitioned to the next one.
 

 
Only tearful fans were left behind.
# Chapter39
[I'm not sure why, but I’m a bit moved.]
 

 
[Mysterious emotion 1]
 

 
[Who says Brother Zhi is fake! I’m telling you to fuck off, he has consciousness and a soul, his own thoughts—why is he considered fake? At most, he's missing a bit of his spirit.]
 

 
This is the emotional response from fans.
 

 
...
 

 
The industry insiders and casual observers were stunned.
 

 
No one expected that a small influencer's drunk livestream could create such a big stir, like pulling up a carrot with all the dirt still attached, with each event escalating more than the last. It started as a replacement issue, then escalated to a huge privilege scandal...
 

 
But once the truth was revealed, Han Zhi is Tong Zhao!
 

 
It was originally a baffling twist, but the program's editing of this footage was done very well.
 

 
Fans are very emotional; they’re hard to deceive but easy to appease. Most who succeed in the entertainment industry by riding the wave of fandom culture usually understand how to comfort fans. Not to mention, after Han Zhi’s five-year reign as a top star, he transitioned to serious acting and moved away from idol work, yet his popularity remained undiminished. It’s not about the flow but surpasses it.
 

 
His Vlog was a genuine performance.
 

 
Outsiders see the spectacle and think he's just incredibly handsome and lucky, with female fans obsessed to the point of madness.
 

 
Insiders see the intricacies and wonder why this amateur understands fangirls so well. In hindsight, it's mostly Tong Zhao's influence.
 

 
To be charming and seductive but not too down-to-earth—becoming purely mundane.
 

 
Fangirls are willing to devote themselves to a celestial ideal, so a certain distance must be maintained to allow for fantasy... Mastering this balance is an art.
 

 
Teenagers usually don't understand this and rely on their agents to teach them.
 

 
Tong Zhao understands this.
 

 
But she doesn't flaunt it.
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi’s success, industry insiders are already discussing—
 

 
Xu Zhu, who debuted third in "Star Selection Girls," had just finished sweating it out in the dance practice room, exhausted. When she returned to her dorm and opened her computer, she was greeted with a flood of bad news. The water army she had deployed was confused, seeking instructions from their sponsor. As she scrolled through Weibo, the related phrases and lines of text burned into her retinas…
 

 
The first message was:
 

 
@Entertainment Affairs:
 

 
"If Tong Zhao were willing to participate in a girl group variety show, she would be a top C-position debutant, and Han Zhi is the best example!"
 

 
Xu Zhu gripped her mouse tightly, her palm sweating so much that it dampened it. She stared at the stream of Weibo posts and trending topics, unwilling to accept reality while desperately searching for more leaks, her face growing increasingly pale.
 

 
The overwhelming "good news" drowned her.
 

 
All praising Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Tong Zhao's subconscious is so diverse—how many more surprises does she have that we don't know about?]
 

 
[Suggest checking Tong Zhao's mental health/dog head. Generally, actors can't handle dual roles.]
 

 
[What does Han Zhi’s rise as a new traffic representative signify? It means Tong Zhao has the ability to attract a large number of male fans, but she doesn’t peddle romantic fantasies. I can’t help but fall for her fierce demeanor. Announcing my investment! (Secretly becoming Han Zhi’s female fan should go unnoticed, right?)]
 

 
...
 

 
The mouse was clicking furiously under Xu Zhu’s grip.
 

 
Her roommate quietly climbed into bed next to her, trying to lower their presence by covering their head with a blanket.
 

 
Finally, Xu Zhu, unable to bear it any longer, closed the entire Weibo page.
 

 
Since Tong Zhenming began mentoring her and she took the stage on "Star Selection Girl," Weibo has been her favorite and most frequently used app. She enjoyed searching her own name and seeing fans showering her with praise...
 

 
When did Xu Zhu stop wanting to open Weibo?
 

 
It was probably after the success of her role as the concubine in "The Ming Emperor's Chronicles."
 

 
Why was her stepsister always so much better and more impressive than she was? Why?
 

 
Why was her stepsister always able to reverse the situation from angles she couldn’t even imagine?
 

 
Xu Zhu really didn’t think she could bring her down this time; she just wanted to make her sick.
 

 
Being entangled with the female fans of a rising star felt like attracting flies, enough to annoy Tong Zhao for a while.
 

 
Now, thinking that Han Zhi is actually Tong Zhao...
 

 
The water army she had deployed ended up being the very wind that pushed Tong Zhao to even greater heights!
 

 
Is there anything more disgusting than this?
 

 
Her roommate, peeking out from under the blanket, saw Xu Zhu rush into the bathroom, followed by the sounds of intense vomiting and faint crying. The knot of jealousy trying to surpass Tong Zhao tightened, but it seemed like nothing she did could make a difference. She could only comfort herself by thinking that at least Tong Zhenming cared deeply about his reputation, and her stepsister had a stubborn personality. As long as the father and daughter didn’t reconcile, the Tong family’s assets would always belong to her brother.
 

 
The Tong family's business is still making money!
 

 
At worst, she could go back to being a rich young lady and marry Zhao Yi.
 

 
The money earned from the Ning-Tong family marriage would definitely be better than being just a star.
 

 
※
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber twice in a row, even Tong Zhao’s body was feeling the strain. She filled the bathtub with hot water and ginger-scented bath salts, immersed herself, and took a deep breath, finally feeling like she was coming back to life.
 

 
Just then, her manager, Chu Jie, called.
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and placed it by the bathtub.
 

 
As soon as the call connected, Chu Jie’s excited voice came through:
 

 
“You’ve done an amazing job! The industry is saying that your crisis management this time was divine. Out of a possible 100 points, you scored 150—50 extra points for Han Zhi. Have you checked Weibo? The comments are all from Han Zhi’s fans apologizing and declaring their love. They’re just hoping that you’ll occasionally perform as Han Zhi in the future. I think some programs could use this identity. Honestly…”
 

 
Chu Jie couldn't contain her laughter: "I've also received several offers for you to play male leads."
 

 
"Tong Zhao? Tong Zhao, are you listening?"
 

 
"Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle..."
 

 
Tong Zhao straightened up, lifting her head out of the water: "I’m listening."
 

 
Chu Jie ignored the strange water sounds and discussed the future direction with her.
 

 
Han Zhi's identity is a great selling point. If Tong Zhao doesn’t mind, it could indeed be used as a public persona, like a virtual streamer, without needing frequent appearances.
 

 
Of course, everything needs Tong Zhao's approval.
 

 
"Let me think about it."
 

 
Tong Zhao needed to consult with Han Zhi.
 

 
All personalities are essentially different versions of herself from different times and worlds. Just as a person’s thoughts change significantly from age three to sixteen to thirty-six, so too can the thoughts between different personalities vary.
 

 
To love others, one must first love oneself. Tong Zhao respects and cherishes her other personalities because they are reflections of her former selves.
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, Han Zhi is going to become a virtual idol?]
 

 
Duan Ge was curious.
 

 
After all, in her past life, due to the end-of-the-world scenario, she never enjoyed high technology. The most advanced technology she encountered was various high-damage weapons.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [I suspect that if I had first crossed over as Han Zhi and then gone to conquer the ancient world, not only would the dog emperor have been head over heels in love with me, but the harem of three thousand beauties would have fallen for me too.]
 

 
[Exaggerated.]
 

 
In the memory palace, Han Zhi's voice was a bit colder, but still gentle: [I can do that, but Zhao Zhao, you need to be clear. Although there’s no distinction between you and me, we both hope that when we return to our original world, we will be the most complete version of Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[I understand.]
 

 
Hearing Han Zhi’s agreement, Tong Zhao accepted Chu Jie’s proposal and let her handle the details.
 

 
It was previously mentioned that each personality is a partial and extreme version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Only when they are all combined can she be considered complete.
 

 
So, they all hope that Tong Zhao won’t rely too much on any single personality.
 

 
However, decisions made by the primary personality are usually not opposed by the others.
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhao received another WeChat message from Chu Jie.
 

 
Chu Jie: [I forgot to mention, Han Zhi’s rise to fame has some artificial traces. Was it your advance purchase of Water Army? Although it was pretty low quality and quite noticeable, the result is good. Next time, let me handle such tasks, and you don’t need to worry about these things.]
 

 
...?
 

 
Tong Zhao nearly slipped and fell in the bathroom.
 

 
She repeatedly sent messages of confusion: "It wasn’t me, I didn’t do it, I don’t know."
 

 
Chu Jie told her to stop being modest.
 

 
Spending money in advance to hype up Han Zhi was a marketing strategy only someone like Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
Chu Jie: [But really, finding a water army requires spending money and finding the right channels. Don’t leave any traces. Next time, let me handle it. Otherwise, I’d be earning my salary for nothing.]
 

 
Tong Zhao denied it again, and this time Chu Jie believed her.
 

 
So, who was behind the water army?
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber, Tong Zhao felt as if she had stepped into another world. She carefully analyzed the shifts in online public opinion and identified a suspect who was both angry and amusing. She thought about it and decided to release Xu Zhu from her contact blacklist, thinking that even if she guessed wrong, it wouldn’t matter.
 

 
Surprisingly, the call went through.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice sounded cheerful: “Xu Zhu, water armies aren’t cheap, are they? It seems that Tong Zhenming really gave you a lot of money and connections.”
 

 
Xu Zhu on the other end of the phone did not respond immediately.
 

 
All Tong Zhao could hear was Xu Zhu's rapid breathing, and she was about ninety percent certain it was Xu Zhu's work.
 

 
"This really sounds like something Xu Zhu would do."
 

 
"Let me guess your thought process," Tong Zhao said cheerfully, pacing back and forth in the room provided by the production team. Her lips curled with a mischievous smile, as if she found amusement in analyzing her stepsister's behavior like playing with a cat or dog:
 

 
"You've been keeping an eye on me and noticed that the male guest spreading rumors about me attracted a bunch of impulsive, low-age fans. So you came up with a scheme to use others to attack me... Maybe 'attack' is too strong a word. You should know, this kind of drama won’t leave me without work; it might even help me maintain my topic's popularity. Four out of ten actresses on the market wouldn’t resist this kind of news, but you know me well enough to know I don’t like this kind of gossip."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, her clear laughter almost giving Xu Zhu a stroke:
 

 
"You spent money and hired a water army just to annoy me? Using the connections and financial power given to you by Tong Zhenming, you ended up turning me into a new rising star... Not everyone can achieve this, and it’s quite an accomplishment. I almost want to remove Tong Zhenming from the blacklist and have a word with him."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao really thought it was a good idea.
 

 
If she could make Tong Zhenming so angry that he had a stroke, it would be a double victory!
 

 
Xu Zhu was on the verge of a stroke.
 

 
Upon hearing that her stepsister intended to take the issue to their father, Xu Zhu panicked: “You said you wouldn’t contact him again!”
 

 
“I regret it. How can I not share such good news with him?”
 

 
“I didn’t buy the water army; I didn’t do anything. Even if you’ve offended someone without realizing it, you can’t blame me for everything!”
 

 
Realizing the situation was going poorly, Xu Zhu thought her stepsister probably didn’t have concrete evidence.
 

 
As long as she denied everything, it would be fine.
 

 
Once she came to this conclusion, she felt much more relaxed. Just as she was putting her mind at ease, she heard dialing sounds on the other end of the phone…
 

 
With a beep, the call was connected.
 

 
Whose call was it?
 

 
While she was wondering, Xu Zhu heard a very familiar middle-aged male voice: “Who is this? If you don’t speak, I’ll hang up.”
 

 
Xu Zhu’s eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually had two phones and was making a call to her father on speakerphone!
 

 
This phone was the one Wei Zekai had reminded her to handle.
 

 
He said it was about separating public and private matters.
 

 
Then, using her new phone, he also added himself to her friends list.
 

 
Tong Zhao had given him a bemused look at the time and asked about the promised separation of public and private matters.
 

 
Wei Zekai had asserted with confidence that both professionally and personally, she should stay in touch with him.
 

 
“Tong Zhenming, it’s me,”
 

 
Thinking about Wei Zekai’s situation, Tong Zhao’s voice softened, carrying a hint of pleasant amusement.
 

 
“Hmph, you only come to me when you're in trouble? When things are fine, you don’t come around?” After recognizing his eldest daughter’s voice, Tong Zhenming sneered.
 

 
He didn’t know much about the entertainment industry.
 

 
What he had recently been exposed to were the comments from Han Zhi’s fans, which his youngest daughter had shown him, either intentionally or unintentionally.
 

 
Given Tong Zhenming’s understanding of his eldest daughter’s personality, she wouldn’t seek reconciliation unless she was truly trapped in a situation with no way out…
 

 
This understanding was still not deep enough.
 

 
After all, in her previous life, Tong Zhao never bowed her head to him, even if she were to sink into the mud.
# Chapter40
"Remember to share good news with your elders," Tong Zhao muttered while glancing at the second phone. The words "[Xu Zhu, in call]" on the screen filled her with immense satisfaction. This phone wasn't on speaker, so while she could hear Xu Zhu's faint cries, Tong Zhenmíng had no idea he was being used as a tool to mock his younger daughter, unknowingly starring in a comedy.
 

 
-- "Don't you think what you're doing is childish?"
 

 
-- "You've won. You've got everything. What more do you want? Enough! I'll apologize, alright? I was wrong!"
 

 
To prevent herself from slipping into depression one day, Tong Zhao had already pressed the record button.
 

 
She could give these two father-daughter audio clips to a professional to adjust and compose into a symphony. Imagine relaxing in a bath, eyes closed, savoring the music. It would certainly make her downtime more enjoyable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "I like this idea."
 

 
The personas in her mind all praised her creativity.
 

 
In the ancient world, before concubine Chen had earned the title of consort, she had once been humiliated by a higher-ranking concubine, who had attempted to disfigure her with torture.
 

 
Although she didn’t suffer any real losses, the emperor, who had been infatuated and manipulated, was so appeased by Song Fei that he practically bent over backward for her. Later, Song Fei was demoted to a foot-washing maid by her side, and eventually banished to the Cold Palace. Everyone thought that the noble consort had long since avenged herself and should have moved on, forgetting all about Song. But not only did she not forget, she even had the emperor's personally bestowed opera troupe create a performance based on this humiliating incident. When bored, she'd have her maids feed her peeled fruit while she listened to the troupe perform.
 

 
It was like the ancient version of a song on repeat.
 

 
The noble consort never tired of hearing it.
 

 
Meanwhile, Song, in the Cold Palace, was so furious that she coughed up blood. The once-proud Lord Song, who had formally criticized Noble Consort Chen, lost all his face and reputation.
 

 
Some whispered that she was overly vindictive and petty, but this only made others more fearful of crossing her.
 

 
Two of life’s greatest joys are when your loved ones succeed and your enemies are left helplessly enraged.
 

 
"I'm currently filming a variety show," Tong Zhao began, her tone seemingly neutral but with a hint of sarcasm reaching its peak. "I'm so popular now that I have to disguise myself and wear a mask when I walk down the street. Half of the credit goes to your youngest daughter." Her words appeared polite, but the venom was unmistakable. "I won't go into detail because you wouldn't understand, but just search for 'Han Zhí' and 'Tong Zhao' online, and you'll see. She used your money and connections to buy a ton of fake accounts to smear me, but it backfired and ended up boosting my fame.”
 

 
"Impressive, Mr. Tong."
 

 
Her cold tone was laced with a hint of amusement, and the end of her sentence had a slight upward lilt.
 

 
Xu Zhu listened in utter despair.
 

 
She knew better than anyone what kind of person her father was and how much affection he really had for her—essentially none. To put it bluntly, even the real daughter raised by his side, Tong Zhao, had been harshly disciplined after daring to defy him following her mother's death. When Tong Zhao ran away from home, he didn’t bother looking for her, secretly hoping to see her fall hard and come back begging in humiliation. Xu Zhu had seen all this firsthand. While it had been satisfying to watch, it also filled her with a sense of dread. She constantly had to maintain a facade of obedience and sweetness in front of him, like a pet keeping up a flimsy father-daughter relationship.
 

 
Now, knowing his youngest daughter had spent his money and caused him to lose face in front of his eldest, what would Tong Zhenming do?
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xu Zhu’s eyes redden. Her fingertips trembled, and her voice rose in hysteria, "I didn’t! I didn’t do any of that!"
 

 
Mindful that she was still in the dorm, she couldn't say too much.
 

 
Her roommates pulled their blankets tighter, thinking the little princess of Star Select was having another episode.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's face darkened.
 

 
The more Xu Zhu desperately denied it, the more certain Tong Zhenmíng was that she was the one behind all the trouble. "Just check your daughter’s financial records, and you'll know. That's all I have to say, Mr. Tong, the philanthropist," she teased in a light, mocking tone before hanging up the phone and blocking him in one smooth motion.
 

 
She didn’t give her opponent any chance to respond.
 

 
After doing all this, she leisurely picked up the phone that was still connected to Xu Zhu. "Reporting behind someone’s back—I learned that trick from you. Turns out it works quite well."
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao only realized after falling out with Xu Zhu that every secret she had ever shared had been secretly told to her father, all to damage his opinion of her. They were nothing more than trivial teenage worries, but Tong Zhenming loved to assert his authority by disciplining his children. Controlling their secrets made him feel like the supreme ruler of the household.
 

 
It was just a typical flaw of authoritarian parents.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let Xu Zhu spend money freely. He likely kept an eye on every transaction she made. And she was certain that, true to his character, he would investigate.
 

 
Would Xu Zhu crumble and be abandoned by Tong Zhenming because of this?
 

 
Probably not.
 

 
But since Xu Zhu had gone out of her way to disgust her, Tong Zhao wasn’t just going to slap her back; she was going to make her feel equally sick.
 

 
"You damn..."
 

 
Just the thought of the incoming wrath from Tong Zhenming and the foreseeable punishment of having her allowance cut down made Xu Zhu's hands tremble, and her words crumbled in disarray.
 

 
The more panicked Xu Zhu became, the more calm and steady Tong Zhao felt.
 

 
She curled up a faint smile, "I'm the kind who holds grudges. You insult me once, and I'll slap you ten times harder. Xu Zhu, this is what you and your mother owe my mom. I'll remember it for the rest of my life. I don't mind wasting time on you, so never provoke me again."
 

 
Tong Zhao hung up the phone and promptly put her back on the blacklist.
 

 
Some people are naturally non-confrontational. Even when the other party is clearly at fault, they first reflect on themselves. After mustering up the courage to stand their ground, they still feel unsettled after the conflict. However, Tong Zhao was a different kind of person. She thoroughly enjoyed humiliating her enemies and drew immense motivation from it.
 

 
What positive self-help books don’t tell you is this: while words of encouragement from friends warm the heart momentarily, like a bowl of chicken soup for the soul, they soon fade. But the scorn and mockery from enemies often become the driving force that propels you out of bed every morning, and that motivation lasts a lot longer.
 

 
Your loving mom might tell you, "Do your best on this exam!”
 

 
The classmate who mocks your idol and steals your pen might say, "You're so obsessed with celebrities, you're definitely going to fail, haha."
 

 
Now, be honest, which one of these gives you more motivation to study?
 

 
After getting humiliated by Tong Zhao, Tong Zhenming indeed went to check the transaction records of Xu Zhu's secondary card.
 

 
Xu Zhu's connections all came from her father, so it was easy for him to inquire about his younger daughter's recent activities. When he asked his secretary about Tong Zhao's situation—despite knowing that the relationship between father and daughter wasn't good—the secretary braced himself and reported truthfully.
 

 
Upon discovering that the situation was exactly as Tong Zhao had said, Tong Zhenming's old face flushed red with both shame and anger.
 

 
Of course, he wasn’t going to reflect on why Tong Zhao had gone out of her way to mock him.
 

 
How could a patriarch ever be wrong?
 

 
In the Tong family, Tong Zhenming was the law and the truth.
 

 
When he was upset, someone had to suffer and get scolded.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao wasn't playing along with his usual tactics, the burden of his wrath fell on Xu Zhu, who had finally been accepted as his daughter.
 

 
Simply yelling over voice calls wasn’t satisfying enough for him, so Tong Zhenming dialed Xu Zhu on a video call.
 

 
When Xu Zhu received the call, she felt a chill run down her spine. Not daring to answer in her room, she rushed to the bathroom, turned on the faucet to ensure her roommates couldn’t hear clearly, and only then carefully pressed to answer the call.
 

 
"Where the hell were you? It took you so long to answer!"
 

 
The screen showed Tong Zhenming’s angry face. After seeing Xu Zhu's panicked apology, he let out a breath but immediately started yelling: "I wouldn't have known if I hadn't checked the transactions! You actually used my money to buy fake followers! Your sister used your stupidity to embarrass me. I'm spending money and effort, but not getting any appreciation! You and your mom must've been born to torment me..."
 

 
"I put you on a show, smoothed everything out, and gave you a stable debut. Do you even know how much talent you have? Look at your sister. I didn’t spend a single penny on her. I let her fend for herself, and look at where she is now. Ever since you were kids, I’ve given you and Tong Zhao the same resources, but neither your looks nor your grades ever matched hers."
 

 
"Your only advantage is that you’re obedient. I thought I could cultivate you since my older daughter turned out to be a disappointment. But no! I thought Tong Zhao was done for, but she’s bounced back. I don’t expect you to be as excellent as her, but at least don’t embarrass me."
 

 
"You got into trouble because you had too much money to spend. Your secondary card is now suspended. Once you’ve reflected on your mistakes, I’ll consider reinstating it."
 

 
Tong Zhenming took pleasure in using his financial control to punish his children. He added another threat: "If you really can’t make a name for yourself, then come back and get married."
 

 
His words hit Xu Zhu like a hammer, crushing her spirit. She didn’t even dare to plead with him because her father hated being talked back to. It wasn’t until the call ended that she wiped her face and realized she was covered in tears.
 

 
Xu Zhu was filled with resentment.
 

 
Before, Tong Zhao had been the center of attention in the family, and all she needed to do was drive a wedge between her stepsister and their father.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was no longer willing to tolerate it.
 

 
Her mother was pregnant with a younger brother, and Tong Zhenming had a thousand hopes pinned on this son. Because of the pregnancy, he couldn’t possibly get angry at her mother, leaving Xu Zhu as the only target in the family to vent on. His recent words were incredibly harsh, far more hurtful than her stepsister’s taunts—each one striking her sore spots a hundred times harder.
 

 
So, in her father’s eyes, she had always been the second choice.
 

 
Even though her stepsister had fallen out with the family...
 

 
Even though she had tried so hard, being obedient and eager to please her father...
 

 
She had thought that since her outdated father didn’t pay attention to the entertainment world, as long as she always reported good news and concealed the bad, she could keep up the illusion of her perfect image in his eyes.
 

 
But in the end, in Tong Zhenming’s eyes, she still wasn’t as good as Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu bit down hard on her back teeth, her jaw clenched so tightly that it made a grinding sound. Her heart turned cold.
 

 
What Xu Zhu didn’t want to admit was that, at this moment, she really envied Tong Zhao.
 

 
Living under Tong Zhenming’s thumb was unbearable!
 

 
But what could she do?
 

 
She hated Tong Zhenming, but she hated Tong Zhao even more.
 

 
If Tong Zhao didn’t live well, then the position of Tong family’s heiress that Xu Zhu had lowered herself to claim would finally hold some meaning.
 

 
As the sound of running water from the faucet echoed, Xu Zhu’s delicate face gradually twisted in anger.
 

 
※
 

 
Due to the change of format for *King of the Sea* into a live broadcast, the shooting was postponed, giving the guests an extra day off.
 

 
He Shun tried to invite Tong Zhao to the cafeteria via WeChat for a meal, but after being flatly rejected, he received a sarcastic message:
 

 
【Actually, I think building something from scratch is more reliable than inheriting wealth. What do you think?】
 

 
Clearly, she was referring to Wei Zekai as a rival.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and replied:
 

 
【I think starting a business doesn’t always succeed, but waiting to inherit an estate? That’s guaranteed.】
 

 
He Shun: 【…】
 

 
Just after sending the message, there was a knock on the door.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, could he be coming to ask in person?
 

 
The male and female guests stayed on separate floors, but since they were adults and the place was filled with security cameras, there weren’t strict rules like a university dorm banning opposite genders from visiting. So far, no scandals had emerged. Tong Zhao cautiously looked through the peephole and froze—
 

 
Standing outside was none other than the "waiting-to-inherit" guy himself.
# Chapter41
As soon as Tong Zhao opened the door, Wei Zekai casually slipped inside.
 

 
He sniffed the air. "Smells nice. Did you spray perfume?"
 

 
"It’s probably the shampoo. I didn’t even put on body lotion."
 

 
It was then that Wei Zekai noticed her wet hair draped over her small shoulders. He stared at it thoughtfully for a moment before saying, "Let’s talk while you dry your hair. If you stay under the air conditioner with wet hair, you'll get a headache."
 

 
"Alright."
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa, plugged the hair dryer into the socket next to it, curious about what nonsense he might spout. She couldn't help but smile, thinking how his sniffing earlier reminded her of the little dog from the variety show. With a queen-like air, she tilted her chin toward him. "Go ahead."
 

 
Wei Zekai sat next to her, holding a stack of documents in his hands.
 

 
It turned out these were investment projects they had discussed before entering the variety show.
 

 
"This is the project for Zeshan Investments."
 

 
Before joining the show, Wei Zekai hadn’t been idle. He had been running around registering the company.
 

 
As for naming the company, his friends had put in a ridiculous amount of enthusiasm…
 

 
"Not Short on Cash Investment Company," "Throwing Money Away Investment Company," "Got Scammed Venture Capital Company," "Might as Well Run Away Investment Company"… There was even a suggestion to add all the members' names, but Tong Zhao asked if the employees would go mad when handling reimbursement invoices. Another second-generation suggested it didn’t matter since they had no employees, but when they found out the company seal couldn’t fit everything, this absurd idea was abandoned.
 

 
In the end, the name "Zeshan" was chosen, supposedly after consulting a Feng Shui master.
 

 
In reality, it was an abbreviation for "Wei Zekai, Charity Gambling King."
 

 
Of course, Wei Zekai didn’t know this.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao was no longer a wealthy second-generation. The funds she had were very limited. The major financial contributors in the small group were Wei Zekai and his friends, but the profit-sharing arrangement was that Tong Zhao would take half of the earnings, excluding the principal.
 

 
Because what to invest in and how to invest was decided by Tong Zhao.
 

 
She was considered to be contributing in terms of technical input.
 

 
In the small group without Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, everyone had discussed that spending money recklessly was no problem. Investing with Wei would likely result in a loss, but only Tong Zhao could persuade him, and he only listened to her.
 

 
So, mastering the art of training dogs was also a skill.
 

 
"You’ve requested strong support for three specific apps, and after the funding was secured, their development speed has noticeably increased. Two of them have released beta versions, and I've sent you the installation packages. I think the 'Excellence Tutoring' app is quite good; it digitizes private tutoring into a one-on-one online format..."
 

 
Wei Zekai chattered on.
 

 
It was clear that he had genuinely spent time understanding the investment projects.
 

 
Investment isn’t just about putting money into a promising company and leaving it at that.
 

 
One must regularly send people to assess the results, ensuring that the money is being used effectively and not just wasted. Small companies' reports may be inflated with false data, and this is something Tong Zhao doesn’t have time to monitor. Coincidentally, this group of second-generation investors, including Wei Zekai, had received education in this area from their families.
 

 
They just lacked the vision and experience.
 

 
This made them excellent tools for Tong Zhao.
 

 
"I think we can provide some directional guidance," Tong Zhao interjected. "Since we’re at it, why not expand the scope? Is learning limited to just Chinese, English, math, and science? Why not include online guitar lessons, cooking... even towel weaving can be taught via video. The key is to recruit various talents; the tutors and the owners are both our clients and our products. Note this idea down and discuss it with them later."
 

 
As long as the money is sufficient and the equity share is high, investment companies can offer direction and even exercise dominant control over projects.
 

 
That’s why some independent studios, despite lacking funds, refuse investments—they fear being led astray by outsiders.
 

 
The app that Tong Zhao was interested in, "Excellence Tutoring," was the predecessor of the nationwide hit "Little Sheep Companion" app. It failed rapidly due to its focus on cloud-based private tutoring, and its creator, Boss Chen, faced a series of personal disasters: his startup failed, his marriage ended, and his elderly relatives died because they couldn't afford medical treatment. After his comeback, he often referenced Zhang Ailing's saying that success, when it comes too late, doesn’t feel the same.
 

 
The reason for the failure was simple.
 

 
The idea of tutoring was good, but Boss Chen overlooked that a mobile app in the eyes of students and parents is often just a tool for entertainment.
 

 
No matter how grand the name or how useful it may seem for learning, seeing students with a mobile phone often equates to them playing games. Moreover, very few people can focus on studying while holding a phone; most would end up opening "Honor of Kings" with a slight slip of the finger.
 

 
After realizing this, Boss Chen gritted his teeth and, with a hint of self-destructive determination, decided to target online gaming enthusiasts and shift to a companion app model. If that didn't work, he would just settle for working to pay off debts.
 

 
As a result, he inadvertently sparked a boom in the companion industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao saw its potential.
 

 
Actually, it would have been better to wait. If she had waited until the "Excellence Tutoring" app’s market feedback was harsh and Boss Chen’s funding chain broke, and if his elderly relatives fell ill again, Wei Zekai could have negotiated and potentially acquired it at a much lower price. However, Tong Zhao, who holds no grudges and appreciates Boss Chen’s tenacity, wouldn't be that ruthless.
 

 
The tenacity of not believing in evil, the kind that gets up and tries again after falling.
 

 
"You often play MOBA games, right? You've played Dota, LOL, and Honor of Kings. You're always complaining about your teammates being too bad and not cooperating. Why not just spend money to hire people to play with you? I want to create such a platform. I think this software is on a narrow path now; it needs to be expanded."
 

 
To ensure Wei Zekai understood, Tong Zhao specifically chose an example he was most familiar with.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaming style mirrored his own personality: a young man with top-notch skills. In the first ten minutes, he would excel across all three lanes, often trying to showcase his abilities to the point where he would get caught and killed by five opponents because no one could keep up with him. After such a rhythm break, he would start to fall apart…
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Wei Zekai understood immediately and then continued discussing other matters.
 

 
The conversation lasted for several hours.
 

 
After drying out his mouth and finishing all the bottled water in the room, they agreed on which aspects of each investment needed follow-up and guidance. The project ideas were good, and the prospects were promising, but without practical business experience, it was necessary to hire relevant talent for guidance. Tong Zhao encouraged him, “You have plenty of talent at your place; just recruit a few to help.”
 

 
Wei Zekai agreed, heading back like a prince choosing his subordinates.
 

 
After resolving the business matters, Wei Zekai left efficiently.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually checked his recent gaming achievements. It had been a while since he last played, indicating that he was indeed very busy.
 

 
……
 

 
After discussing all night, the manager concluded that making one person earn two incomes was not feasible.
 

 
It was too exhausting for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The previous medical examination report, which showed an unclear area in Tong Zhao's brain scan, also worried Sister Chu. Although Han Zhi was a cash cow, the company did not want to exploit her to the point of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. If Han Zhi was marketed as a separate entity, fans on both sides would inevitably demand equal treatment. Any resources available to Tong Zhao would need to be available to Han Zhi as well.
 

 
So, the final conclusion was not to create a separate Weibo account for Han Zhi.
 

 
Do you like Han Zhi?
 

 
Fine, just confess and send flowers under Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The official stance was that the two were considered the same person, and Sister Chu passed this approach on to the major fan heads.
 

 
As long as it wasn't too outrageous, fans generally listened to fan heads.
 

 
Sometimes, the extent of their obedience made one wonder whether they were fans of the fan heads or the celebrities themselves.
 

 
The company's decision was swift and clear.
 

 
In no time, Tong Zhao gained a large number of female fans.
 

 
Thus, among the many young celebrities, the style of comments under Tong Zhao's Weibo was particularly unique:
 

 
[Humble fan begging for Brother Zhi to make an appearance]
 

 
[Zhao Zi, take care of your health too! It's really not easy to satisfy both sides of the fans. No matter which side, you are our treasure!]
 

 
[Hello, this comment is a gathering place for double-support fans/doge emoji]
 

 
Double-support fans always hold a lower status wherever they are.
 

 
After all, the fandom often has a bit of a binary mentality, valuing purity of stance.
 

 
If you like both, it means you don't like either.
 

 
But for Tong Zhao, "double-support fans" are the mainstream.
 

 
If you only like Tong Zhao, does that mean you can’t accept her more masculine side?
 

 
If you only like Han Zhi, then you’re even more fickle; the brother you like is not even the complete package!
 

 
Damn.
 

 
Fans are easily swayed by their emotions. If you say they don’t really like the brother, they’re more eager than anyone. This passionate, selfless emotion that doesn’t consider future gains has been forcibly sustained as a trickle with Tong Zhao…
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao doesn’t have any albums to push for sales.
 

 
She doesn’t have any endorsements yet.
 

 
Fans are more impatient than she is, and some even went to the company’s Weibo to complain:
 

 
"Sister Zhao’s popularity has been so high recently, why not seize the opportunity to promote more?"
 

 
"What about endorsements? Get them lined up! Do we need to teach you?"
 

 
"I urge you to be kind; don’t ignore her treatment just because Sister is low-key and doesn’t fight for herself. We are her support; we will fight for her!"
 

 
Passionate fans attacking fellow allies, delivering a crushing blow with a critical hit of 999.
 

 
The company was both amused and helpless, quickly explaining that Tong Zhao would soon have a secondary line of luxury brand perfume endorsements. However, because Han Zhi’s unexpected rise in popularity, the brand hoped to incorporate Han Zhi's image into the endorsement promotion, which delayed the progress.
 

 
This explanation met the fans' needs perfectly.
 

 
The comments that had just viciously criticized the company suddenly turned into a spring breeze, causing the PR team to breathe a sigh of relief and marvel at how realistic things were.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, while other actresses with similar positioning to hers could not find the humor in it.
 

 
Except for those who could avoid the spotlight with a sweet and soft loli persona, other actresses in the same period were urging their managers to schedule their slots before Tong Zhao finished filming her variety show, to avoid competing with her—something they couldn’t win. Some young male stars’ managers were even inquiring with Sister Chu to find out if Tong Zhao had any intention of cross-dressing in roles meant for male stars.
 

 
Sigh, women have to be wary, and men have to be wary of her too.
 

 
This woman, why is she so annoying?
 

 
Disliking a peer is useless; it’s the fans and the audience who watch her.
 

 
Even so, before "Sea King Killer" even premiered, the number of viewers was poised to break new records, maintaining its momentum at the platinum level. Moreover, 70% of the audience was drawn to Tong Zhao, turning what was supposed to be a multi-person variety show into something like a solo performance.
 

 
Fortunately, most of the guests were ordinary people. If it relied on fellow stars who thrive on popularity, they would have laughed until they cried.
 

 
There were even idle netizens suggesting that Tong Zhao’s “true self” is so varied that perhaps a show could be made to explore how many facets of her subconscious could be revealed.
 

 
This suggestion was immediately drowned out by the spittle of fans and conscientious netizens.
 

 
[Got it, Tong Zhao is the Voldemort of the film industry, arrange for seven Horcruxes.]
 

 
[Impossible, the consciousness would be confused, and just performing alongside Han Zhi already drains Zhao Zhao’s energy. Drag out those who make such ridiculous suggestions and lock them up.]
 

 
Fans were quite worried.
 

 
To them, Tong Zhao was too challenging.
 

 
In the variety show, where she played two roles, the director had no hope that she would agree. Yet, not only did she agree, but she did so enthusiastically. While her fans were proud of her, they were also worried that she might not take care of her health. A netizen who was being attacked was anxious and said, [Tong Zhao's unique subconscious type is a gold mine. Protecting her is useless; the company won’t leave a gold mine untapped.]
 

 
Her manager, Sister Chu, was quite speechless and specifically advised her, “Don’t take what netizens say seriously. The company seeks profit, not harm. We’re not digging for gold; we’re taking care of the artist’s well-being.”
 

 
“Thank you, Sister Chu.”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave a sweet smile.
 

 
She then turned to discuss with others, “I think this idea is good. Once we have the funds, let’s invest in it ourselves. It could be like an offline meeting. I’ve even thought of a name for the show: ‘A Loving Family.’”
 

 
Concubine Shen: [Help, that sounds so tacky.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [Tacky 1]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I think it’s okay? Whatever, how about ‘Psychotic Thinking World,’ and Kai can go next door to ‘Happy Idiot Children’] She had a particular fondness for the foolish and adorable Wei Zekai.
 

 
Han Zhi also thought it sounded tacky.
 

 
However, his principle was not to criticize women unless necessary, so he listened quietly as they discussed.
 

 
Amid the laughter and the ever-increasing wave of audience, Tong Zhao lay down in the holographic shooting chamber, trying to clear her mind and make way for Han Zhi and Concubine Chen.
 

 
Probably accustomed to the dull and boring life in the palace, Concubine Chen particularly enjoyed being in the spotlight.
 

 
For such performance opportunities, she was more proactive than the other personalities.
 

 
As the machinery began to force her into a deep sleep, Concubine Chen raised her eyebrows and looked over.
 

 
In the memory palace, each personality maintained the image they cherished most in life. She was dressed in the concubine's imperial robe, the red gown with gold threads shimmering in waves as she took graceful steps, bold and dazzling. In the palace, one must first honor the clothes before honoring the person. Regardless of what others thought, everyone who saw Concubine Chen had to kneel first.
 

 
“So…” she slowly opened the topic, “our task later is to flirt with each other?”
 

 
“Our memories have all been restored,” Han Zhi reminded her.
 

 
That’s right, all the personalities remembered how passionately they had kissed.
 

 
Her question was essentially pointless.
 

 
“You should be careful; I can be very unscrupulous to win a man's heart.”
 

 
Concubine Chen snorted, her face lifting into a charming smile.
 

 
As her body gradually fell into a deep sleep under the influence of the machinery, the lights in the memory palace began to dim, casting Han Zhi’s gentle and handsome face into deep shadows, like a dangerous creature lurking in the dark depths of the sea.
 

 
“Fair point, I’ll be cautious.”
 

 
He accepted the reminder with a kind-hearted demeanor, gently holding Concubine Chen’s cool and soft hand.
 

 
The entire hall fell silently into darkness…
 

 
*
 

 
The program was already being broadcast live.
 

 
The director was adept at teasing the audience's emotions, first focusing the camera on several ordinary audience members, with an unusually long stay on Wei Zekai. Han Zhi was excluded from the "Sea King" category by Wei Zekai, making He Shun a prime suspect for that role, so the camera lingered on He Shun.
 

 
[Alert dog.jpg]
 

 
[Wei Zekai has ruled out one correct answer!]
 

 
[Want to see Brother Zhi, show him more on camera, please!]
 

 
As they spoke, many of Han Zhi's fans eagerly spent money, donning golden name tags in support of him in the live stream chat.
 

 
...
 

 
Just like in "The Truman Show," the guests were unaware that every move they made was being observed.
 

 
Han Zhi remained very composed.
 

 
Despite having a "bad boy" backstory in his character setting, he didn’t seem in a rush to pursue the girls, keeping a relaxed distance from them.
 

 
He sat on a sofa in the corner, stretching his long legs. The sunlight highlighted his profile with a golden edge, making him appear almost unreal. Fans naturally took a flurry of screenshots; unable to see their idol in real life on a schedule, they had to preserve these moments as best as they could.
 

 
Not only was Han Zhi calm, but Tong Zhao also appeared disinterested in him.
 

 
It was as if the previously passionate kissing scenes were merely the audience's one-sided imagination.
 

 
[I don’t know why, but even if they do nothing, just being in the same frame makes me feel a certain way.]
 

 
[Damn, fellow traveler.]
 

 
[Does this count as "bone science"?]
 

 
[Same person, guess it's "narcissus," self-inflicted, I flirt with myself!]
 

 
The barrage of comments was lively, though nothing much happened.
 

 
After the director emphasized the underlying tension, the focus shifted to the actual events of the day. Filming was like dreaming, with the duration determined by the brain's ebb and flow. In ordinary dreams, people often find themselves sitting at a table eating a fried egg, only to wake up and realize seven hours have passed, and it's time to go to work or school.
 

 
After He Shun, holding a teacher’s ID card, tutored Tong Zhao for two sessions, she stretched her back.
 

 
“So tired.”
 

 
The director expertly focused the camera on her.
 

 
As the young girl's slender, white arms stretched out, her waist, barely more than a handful, was also revealed on camera.
 

 
At that moment, the audience was immersed in He Shun's perspective.
 

 
Even female viewers could completely understand why this man would be captivated.
 

 
Who could resist such a stunning visual?
 

 
He Shun, overwhelmed by the breathtaking sight, was no exception.
 

 
He took the cue and said, “We've been studying all afternoon; it’s better to combine work with relaxation. How about going for a walk together?”
 

 
Due to Tong Zhao's request, their tutoring didn’t take place in the study room but rather in the living room where everyone could see them, and they spoke in low tones. From He Shun’s inner thoughts, the audience knew he had been trying to find ways to be alone with her, yet he was afraid of appearing too obvious and scaring the timid girl.
 

 
Of course, from the god’s eye view, the audience also knew...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I'm getting a bit tired of the lessons. When should I make my move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Let’s do it today. Give him a chance to seize it.]
 

 
In her inner thoughts, Tong Zhao was always lazy, her voice charmingly aloof.
 

 
The Empress Dowager was very proactive.
 

 
But her proactiveness meant graciously giving men the chance to pursue her.
 

 
She was the gatekeeper, the one who set the rules of the game.
 

 
The only reason one could win in this game named "Empress Dowager" was that she was willing to.
 

 
Watching the Empress Dowager flirt on livestream was thrilling.
 

 
Many people lamented that it would be entertaining if "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor" also broadcast Tong Zhao's psychological activities in high intensity, with one fan writing a heartfelt plea for Tong Zhao to star in a palace drama!
 

 
Seeing He Shun respond, Tong Zhao nodded with pleasure, "Sure."
 

 
She looked up at him, her eyes moist and full of reliance and a touch of admiration for the man.
 

 
Admiration with eyes full of starlight was one thing.
 

 
What was crucial was that she even pretended to work hard to hide her admiration, directly hitting the man’s soft spot.
 

 
Originally struck by the revelation that their goddess had a man in her mind, Tong Zhao's male fans were reignited with hope at this glance.
 

 
[If my wife looks at me like this, I won't be able to control myself.]
 

 
[Those who can't accept Han Zhi's male fans have no right to call her 'wife'! Zhao Bao, I'm bisexual—consider me?]
 

 
[I envy this ordinary guest so much. Any ordinary man would consider a lifetime worthwhile just to be flirted with by such a stunning beauty.]
 

 
[Exactly, being flirted with by her really leaves a lasting impression…]
 

 
This melancholic comment immediately attracted ridicule from others, mocking the commenter as if he had truly been flirted with by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Feeling his conscience, does he even deserve it?
 

 
Song Wanzhuo, who was being questioned, felt a bit suffocated.
 

 
This time, he was quite smart about pursuing his star, no longer mentioning it much on Weibo. Otherwise, his handsome and charming image would soon be reduced to that of a dog emperor. Dogs weren’t the problem; it actually proved that he played the role of Ming Emperor well, as the audience remembered him.
 

 
How many roles in an actor's lifetime can leave such a deep impression on the audience?
 

 
The issue was that ever since Tong Zhao’s various provocative actions, his "dog emperor" title now had an additional prefix—
 

 
Wearing a green hat.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was furious!
 

 
While fuming, he took two close-up shots of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Oh, Zhao Zhao, my wife is truly beautiful.
 

 
He Shun thought the same.
 

 
In addition to the large duplex villa, the estate also had a garden with small bridges and flowing water, providing plenty of private space for the guests. With such an excessively large garden, it was really hard for these six people to run into each other.
 

 
The backstage narrator timely reminded that He Shun had actually sneaked in to scout the place before.
 

 
[Damn, what does he want to do to my wife!]
 

 
[Don’t worry, any inappropriate thoughts will be detected by the intelligent AI, and the scenes you gents are hoping for won’t appear.]
 

 
He Shun really didn’t have any such intentions.
 

 
He just wanted to maintain his omnipotent, authoritative image in Tong Zhao’s eyes.
 

 
“I remember you’re very interested in biology,” He Shun said lightly, following Tong Zhao’s gaze and offering a brief lesson: “Here we have koi from the royal three families. Look at this one; its red markings on the head are particularly large, and the small round red spots on its mouth are like lipstick. This one is a golden and silver-scaled red and white koi…”
 

 
When He Shun mentioned lipstick, his gaze inevitably fell on Tong Zhao's full, slightly pouting lips.
 

 
He thought, [Even though she isn’t wearing lipstick, her lips are still so rosy. She’s just too beautiful.]
 

 
The bullet comments were merciless:
 

 
[She’s wearing lipstick, straight men need to get their eyes checked.]
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts were even more ruthless:
 

 
[Hmm, listening to him ramble on, he must have done his homework beforehand. He really wants to show off in front of me.]
 

 
[Alright, alright, he’s quite diligent. I’ll indulge him a bit.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice remained lazily indifferent.
 

 
It was as if she was playing a cliché game she had already mastered countless times, with the boss and attack patterns so familiar that she felt a bit disinterested.
 

 
With that in mind, Tong Zhao looked up at him with a smile, her eyes sparkling like a little dog: “Mr. He, you know so much.”
# Chapter42
A gentle breeze rippled across the pond.
 

 
When He Shun lowered his head, he met Tong Zhao’s gaze, which sparkled like stars.
 

 
This unprecedentedly inflated his confidence.
 

 
When a man is attracted to a woman, the most obvious behavior isn’t necessarily being nice to her, as some men tend to hold back a bit. The clearest signal is when he deliberately shows off his strengths to catch her attention. It could be his work abilities, his talent and thoughtfulness, his willingness to spend time with her, or even more, revealing his past romantic experiences. It’s like saying, “Look! I’m such a devoted, kind-hearted guy. Now, aren’t you going to get in bed with me?”
 

 
"It’s just something I happen to know," He Shun restrained himself with the last bit of rationality he had left, avoiding further showing off. "You don’t have to call me ‘teacher.’ You can just use my name. After all, I didn’t call you ‘Student Tong,’ did I?"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice: 【...Ugh, this is so cheesy.】
 

 
Contrary to her dismissive inner thoughts, she smiled gently, her white dress swaying in the wind, creating soft, layered ripples—fulfilling every man’s fantasy of the sweet childhood crush.
 

 
When the audience thought she would follow through with the sweet tactic and call him “Brother He” in a soft voice, she instead let her smile fade slightly: "Since you’re tutoring me, calling you by your full name feels a bit disrespectful."
 

 
He Shun, Brother He, Ah Shun...
 

 
No matter how she addressed him, as long as it came from Tong Zhao’s lips, He Shun wanted to hear it. Yet at this moment, Tong Zhao seemed completely oblivious to his hint.
 

 
He Shun immediately became a bit anxious: "I’ve never felt disrespected by you."
 

 
As he rushed to express his loyalty, the composed demeanor he had earlier crumbled like sand blown away by the wind.
 

 
[You want me to change how I address you without showing any sincerity? You're too greedy, Little He.] Tong Zhao's haughty inner voice revealed to the audience what was really going on.
 

 
So, the noble consort was displeased!
 

 
The live chat marveled at her skill, acknowledging that a true expert was at work.
 

 
He Shun was the typical successful, elite man—used to taking charge in relationships, often finding fault with others. However, in front of Tong Zhao, his psychological shifts were entirely under her control. Every advance and retreat was dictated by her.
 

 
A VIP viewer posted a meme from *Tom and Jerry*, capturing a melancholic Tom with the caption: "[Poor Tom, being played in the palm of her hand.jpg]". It was instantly upvoted to 999 by the live-stream audience.
 

 
It was spot on!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond verbally, only giving him a slightly puzzled look.
 

 
【This is baiting.】
 

 
【Men are natural hunters. He Shun has already invested so much time and emotional energy in me, and I'm clearly the best "stock" among the three options. He needs to see a little hope of growth—the current stagnation is just because he hasn't invested enough yet...】
 

 
【I need to make him believe that if he invests a bit more and performs better, he’ll get a return with interest on everything he's put in.】
 

 
Tong Zhao’s cold and calculating inner thoughts stood in stark contrast to her gentle and sweet exterior.
 

 
In her mind, emotions were reduced to stocks, and He Shun was merely an investor.
 

 
It seemed like the one making the choices was the investor, but in reality, there’s always someone behind the scenes—the operator.
 

 
Some of the comments, clearly from male viewers, had already started criticizing her, calling her a bad woman.
 

 
But many more found her intriguing.
 

 
“I don’t just want to be your teacher.” Picking up on her signals, He Shun immediately raised the stakes.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
He Shun softened his tone: “As a teacher, the relationship ends once the lessons are over, right? I don’t want that to happen.”
 

 
The audience was stunned.
 

 
[That’s it? That’s it? That’s it?]
 

 
[You chickened out right at the finish line?]
 

 
[We gave you the chance, and you blew it, Little He!]
 

 
Some viewers had already forgotten about He Shun's impressive credentials and high social status, which placed him in the top 80% of men in real life, and they began mimicking Tong Zhao’s tone, calling him "Little He."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile faded, becoming almost nonexistent.
 

 
She had a face that held up under scrutiny, a real beauty.
 

 
This was quite different from the sweet, girl-next-door type. When she smiled, it was pure and soft, but when she didn’t, there was a noticeable distance. It felt as though—
 

 
If he didn’t raise the stakes and show more sincerity, he was about to miss his chance to invest in her.
 

 
“Tong Zhao…” he called her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao curled her lips slightly, her tone sounding annoyed: "I don't need more friends."
 

 
The two of them stood by the pond, leaning against the bridge railing, as the wind blew through the girl’s long, curly hair, momentarily blinding He Shun.
 

 
He Shun desperately analyzed the information hidden in her words.
 

 
Tong Zhao lightly bit the inside of her cheek, using the pain to stifle her laughter, making her look even more irritated.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao didn’t explicitly say it, her signals were clear. He Shun had a sudden realization: “Of course, Tong Zhao admires me so much. She must be feeling insecure inside and really needs my reassurance and protection... I’m a grown man—should I really wait for a young girl to take the initiative? That wouldn’t be right. Ah, I just can’t help but spoil her.”
 

 
This delusional inner monologue from He Shun, full of affectionate indulgence, immediately struck the audience, who had a godlike perspective, as hilarious.
 

 
[This is the charm of a regular person—unintentionally funny?]
 

 
[I bet this is exactly what Emperor Ming thought back then—‘Oh, my poor concubine! She can only rely on my brilliant and mighty self. Look at how much she adores me. I must protect this sweet, innocent girl.’]
 

 
[...]
 

 
No need to wonder, that last comment was sent by Song Wanzhuo, whose pride had taken another hit.
 

 
“Stop roasting me already! If this keeps up, I’ll be a fool,” Song Wanzhuo thought.
 

 
Unconvinced, Song Wanzhuo decided to turn off the holographic viewing mode and switch to a traditional viewing perspective. At the same time, he opened a document, intending to write an essay reflecting on Emperor Ming’s inner thoughts. He was convinced that he and that fool He Shun were nothing alike. He had to set the record straight, refusing to let the goofy netizens continue twisting the narrative.
 

 
He Shun was an outsider to the entertainment industry, so no matter how much people compared him to Song Wanzhuo, it wouldn’t affect Song’s popularity. Because of this, Song's fans found such comments amusing and didn’t bother to stop them, even enjoying the opportunity to create an image of Song’s fanbase as well-mannered and respectful, not harassing others.
 

 
His model friend, Ling Zisheng, lit a cigarette, glancing at him: “Why are you even writing this? There's no need to clarify anything. No matter how much this outsider tries to ride your coattails, it won’t affect you.”
 

 
“I know,”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, typing away without looking up: “But what if *Baobei* sees it and mistakes me for being like that idiot?”
 

 
“Who’s *Baobei*? Do you have a girlfriend and you’re not telling your bro?”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, puzzled, lowered his head to light his cigarette.
 

 
“Zhaobao, of course.”
 

 
As he spoke, Song Wanzhuo quickly captured two close-up shots of Tong Zhao's beautiful face.
 

 
“...”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, known for his calm and cool persona, shuddered at the response, nearly burning his fingers with the lighter.
 

 
Ling Zisheng started thinking maybe their agent had a point. The biggest threat to Song Wanzhuo’s public image wasn’t having a girlfriend—it was this childhood friend of his.
 

 
At that moment, in *King of the Sea*, He Shun finally summoned the courage to say the key words: "So, do you need a boyfriend?”
 

 
Under the camera, his attempt to act relaxed was seen through clearly by the audience.
 

 
At this moment, his previous "straight man syndrome" and macho attitude didn’t seem as off-putting, and the viewers began lighting metaphorical candles for him.
 

 
["Poor He Shun, getting played like a puppet in her hands."]
 

 
["I love Sister Zhao's bad girl energy so much, please crank it up!"]
 

 
The "bad woman" Tong Zhao stepped back upon hearing this, her face flushed.
 

 
What the heck!
 

 
How was this possible? How could this woman blush on command?
 

 
The audience was utterly confused, but somehow, she just had that skill.
 

 
Tong Zhao also bruised easily, though the marks faded quickly.
 

 
"Are you confessing to me?" At this moment, Tong Zhao's earlier calm and aloof demeanor was nowhere to be found. Her sweet voice trembled slightly, and she awkwardly averted her gaze with a shy, embarrassed look: "You're older than me, more mature, you know so much, and I've never been in a relationship before. If you're just looking to play around..."
 

 
Tong Zhao's inner voice was lively: *"Then you’ve definitely found the right person!"*
 

 
Of course, she didn’t say that out loud.
 

 
Her eyes were welling up with tears, holding back her laughter.
 

 
She had to stifle her laughter as she pushed He Shun to the edge of a cliff with her flattery.
 

 
All the guests knew the rules of the game in *King of the Seas*. You could talk however you liked, but most wouldn’t register their "crush" on the app. Just like in real life, very few people would hand over their paycheck or add someone to the house deed while still dating.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were the one to bring it up first, it might trigger He Shun's suspicion or wariness.
 

 
The essence of romantic relationships is an exchange of benefits. These benefits could be appearance, companionship, money, loyalty, or even the promise of marriage.
 

 
To leverage something small into something bigger, you must use psychological tactics to create an illusion for the other party.
 

 
Why are so many women willing to act as free housekeepers before marriage? It’s because these men often give out a "promise of marriage" in exchange for actual domestic labor, claiming, "I’m working hard for *our* future happiness." But if you think about it, a promise of marriage before actually tying the knot is just empty talk. Would a man stop working hard if he didn’t have a girlfriend? Of course not—it’s nonsense, pure deception, with bad intentions.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao was exactly that kind of bad woman with bad intentions.
 

 
So, she had to keep pressing forward, step by step.
 

 
Step by step, He Shun unconsciously added more to the pot.
 

 
While pushing him to make a statement, Tong Zhao used compliments to make him believe he was the one holding all the cards, the one in control.
 

 
[--This was a trap carefully crafted after understanding He Shun's personality weaknesses.]
 

 
With Tong Zhao's calm inner voice, He Shun interrupted her self-deprecating remarks: "I’m serious. You don’t need to give me an answer right now, but I can show you my sincerity."
 

 
Saying that, He Shun took out his phone.
 

 
Under the watchful eyes of millions of viewers, he opened the official app for signaling romantic interest. After a brief loading screen, he selected Tong Zhao without a moment's hesitation and firmly pressed confirm.
 

 
As soon as He Shun pressed the button, the screen changed: “Congratulations, player! You've found your match!”
 

 
The cheesy fireworks and clapping sound effects added a bit of humor to the historic moment.
 

 
He Shun felt he was embodying the responsibility and grace of a mature man.
 

 
The chat was stunned.
 

 
[Did he really just give in that easily?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao didn’t really seem to do much, yet it feels like she did everything…]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, it's time to back off. We can't keep up with her. Isn't just being a pure looks fan or career fan enough?]
 

 
Some fans of Han Zhi jokingly commented in the livestream:
 

 
"[Oh no, oh no, Zhao Zhao scores the first point, Zhi Ge is falling behind!]"
 
"[I’m willing to fill Zhi Ge's fish pond.]"
 
"[Go for it, Zhi Ge!]"
 

 
While banter flew outside the show, real emotions of love and jealousy were unfolding within.
 

 
[...Ah, level cleared.]
 

 
The audience could easily sense the boredom in Tong Zhao’s inner voice.
 

 
However, on her face, she graciously displayed a touched expression. She played her part well, acting as if she was deeply moved by being chosen so decisively for the first time, almost as if He Shun were her savior. But, since it was her first experience, she couldn’t quickly give him an answer...
 

 
Then she added a shy smile.
 

 
To a man, it looked like the bashfulness of a girl experiencing her first love, and naturally, he wouldn’t push her for a response.
 

 
This is the advantage of showing weakness in relationships.
 

 
Outwardly weak, but inwardly strong.
 

 
It leaves the other person with no choice but to feel morally obligated!
 

 
[I wonder when he’ll realize I never actually accepted his pursuit?]
 

 
[Oh well, it doesn’t matter.]
 

 
[Let’s see who I’ll play with next.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao thought this, she and He Shun strolled around the garden for a while.
 

 
What neither they nor the audience noticed was that a fluffy little dog was hiding behind the bushes, observing them in secret...
 

 
When the director switched the camera, the audience realized that Wei Zekai was dutifully performing his role as a judge, keeping an eye on the "bad guy"! Although the distance was quite far, Wei Zekai, now a dog, had excellent hearing and could clearly hear their conversation.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Hmm, I can hear their conversation very clearly.]
 

 
The audience was alarmed—Tong Zhao was in danger!
 

 
It's normal for He Shun to be swayed by novelty and have reduced judgment due to infatuation. This can be understood.
 

 
In love, the observers are always clearer.
 

 
With a bit of romantic experience, one can step back and observe the two of them to see that there were details about Tong Zhao that seemed off.
 

 
Wei Ke: [Tong Zhao really is a...]
 

 
[Femme fatale! Femme fatale! Femme fatale!]
 

 
[Sea King! Sea King! Sea King!]
 

 
[There’s only one truth—]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s doggy eyes looked admiringly at her departing figure: [...a girl who takes relationships seriously and is pure!]
 

 
......
 

 
.........
 

 
[It’s hopeless, both Wei Zekai and I who had expectations for him are doomed.]
 

 
[For the sake of the show, why not set up a bet on how long it will take for the princess to win him over?]
 

 
[I'm reasonably suspicious that Wei Zekai is still a virgin.]
 

 
[Virgin 1]
 

 
[I want to keep following this pair!]
 

 
Wei Zekai clenched its pink paw pads and wagged its little tail.
 

 
※
 

 
The events in the garden were known to no one other than Wei Zekai.
 

 
He was aware that he didn’t get along well with the other two girls, and Wei Zekai seemed too aloof and immature, so when he was bored, he mostly chatted with Han Zhi. Interestingly, although he initially looked down on Han Zhi for being too good-looking, he found him to be quite pleasant and a good company.
 

 
However, from the audience's god's-eye view, Han Zhi showed no interest in chatting with men.
 

 
[So boring, can you not corner me into talking?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s thoughts were very cold, lacking the gentle patience he had when speaking with girls.
 

 
He felt he could converse well with Han Zhi...
 

 
Only because of the emotional intelligence gap, he was under the illusion that they had a lot in common, but it was really just that Han Zhi was playing along.
 

 
Without much thought, He Shun asked, “It looks like you must get confessed to by girls often.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback, not expecting such a personal question, and replied with a smile, “Not really, saying ‘often’ is an exaggeration.”
 

 
He Shun looked at him with a somewhat envious and dismissive gaze.
 

 
Who doesn’t want to be a popular man?
 

 
However, he already had the best one, and thinking about Tong Zhao's appearance, he spoke with a hint of superiority: "Anyway, it's definitely more than I have."
 

 
Han Zhi responded with a simple “Hmm?” and let him continue performing on stage.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This guy’s desire to perform is overflowing the screen... Should I start charging for this chat?]
 

 
The audience couldn't help but laugh.
 

 
Since learning that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, they began to see their common traits.
 

 
One of those traits was a somewhat harsh sense of humor.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t hide his amusement in his voice: “I prefer to take the initiative. Women are shy and like to play hard to get; there's nothing we can do about them, so we men have to be more proactive.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and deflected the conversation, thinking to himself: [He seems excited; he must have been won over by Tong Zhao.]
 

 
The roles in their interactions were quite clear; he understood them well.
 

 
[That seemingly perfect girl, could she actually be interested in He Shun?]
 

 
Han Zhi subtly glanced at the open door on the second floor.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t often come to public spaces and maintained a vague distance from everyone, adding to her air of mystery.
 

 
[It seems we've tacitly put each other at the bottom of the list.]
 

 
The audience sighed as they listened.
 

 
It seems we won’t be seeing any high-level matches for now!
 

 
We’ll have to settle for watching the low-level games and how they maintain their daily routines.
 

 
For the daily surprise tasks, it seemed that the production team intentionally mixed up the players' teams to create more excitement. Zhong Muxi drew He Shun, Chang Xiaonian ended up with the very cautious and handsome Han Zhi, leaving Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a pair.
 

 
The male side decides on the activities to build friendship, with restrictions against anything explicit or offensive.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a good impression of the innocent girl in his mind and took off his game headset: “Do you play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...What games?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Honor of Kings.”
 

 
……
 

 
Wearing a white dress with an ethereal, otherworldly beauty, Tong Zhao gave him a very tolerant smile and told herself: [The task content is here, there’s money to be made, cater to their interests, cater to their interests...]
 

 
So, they went to the gaming room to play ranked matches.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was actually good at Honor of Kings (in reality, she was introduced to it by Wei Zekai), the production team had set up an account for her that was exactly like the one she remembered. Wei Zekai was surprised: “You’re also a king-tier player? What role do you play?”
 

 
He doubted her ability, suspecting she was carried by a high-level player.
 

 
The word “surprisingly” sounded a bit off-putting, but Wei Zekai himself meant no harm.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a glance and tentatively showed weakness: “If you’re really good, I could play support for you.”
 

 
As soon as he agreed, Tong Zhao could stage a scenario of "The Wild King and His Supportive Little Wife."
 

 
Unexpectedly, Wei Zekai raised his eyebrows. The self-reminder to be gentle with girls evaporated instantly, and his proud and youthful demeanor emerged sharply:
 

 
“Are you trying to leech off my points?”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of anger, her feelings hurt.
 

 
From her psychological activity, the live audience could see that although she often showed weakness to men, she was actually very ambitious and had a high sense of pride. This time, she flashed a delicate smile, her aura suddenly turning sharp: “Then I’ll take the support role.”
 

 
In the first game, she played as the side lane hero, Orange Jing.
 

 
In the second game, she chose the mid-lane hero, Shangguan Wan’er.
 

 
For the third game, she picked the marksman, Gongsun Li.
 

 
Finally, before the activity time limit ended, Tong Zhao chose the support position she had mentioned at the start. With her strong performance as Ghost Valley, she roamed the entire map, controlling the rhythm of the game. Under her influence, the opponents dared not show themselves. After winning four consecutive games and earning MVP in all, Tong Zhao let out a sigh of relief, feeling her mood improve a bit.
 

 
After calming down a little, Tong Zhao suddenly realized something.
 

 
She had forgotten that this was a perfect opportunity to strategize against Wei Zekai.
 

 
She should have let him take the stage instead...
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at Wei Zekai, and as if fate had its way, he also turned towards her at that moment.
 

 
“Wow…”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at her with stars in his eyes, shining brightly: “Impressive, girl!”
 

 
…?
 

 
“Very few people can keep up with me. Your awareness and control are top-notch.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was generous with his praise.
 

 
The audience also noticed that Wei Zekai’s liking for Tong Zhao had indeed increased significantly.
 

 
[The way to marry into a wealthy family has been mastered: first, play as top-tier national server support.]
 

 
[Help, he’s not going to start seeing her as a brother, is he?]
 

 
[That look, it seems like he’s looking at a comrade.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit speechless.
 

 
She was a quick learner, young with fast reactions, and excelled in MOBA and strategy games. After the four games, she had already figured out Wei Zekai’s general personality. With that in mind, duo queue turned out to be a good dating activity, a good way to understand each other's character. At the very least, it helps to exclude boys who frequently go AFK and curse in the game.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a bit of a personal heroism streak; he wanted to win the game by carrying it himself.
 

 
At the same time, he wouldn’t abandon his teammates and had a sense of loyalty.
 

 
However, he lacked a broad perspective and was prone to focusing too much on one point, potentially losing a good game.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to do something, if Tong Zhao had more kills than he did, he would obediently follow her instructions. In a similar situation, Tong Zhao felt that He Shun would not follow orders and could only be guided through coaxing.
 

 
[Much cuter than that guy named He.]
 

 
[But he keeps secretly leeching off my lanes while jungling, which is a bit annoying.]
 

 
In contrast to Wei Zekai’s increased affection, Tong Zhao’s feelings for him slightly declined.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s evaluation of her was genuinely high.
 

 
He thought the girl was excellent, serious about relationships, and skilled at gaming.
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced at her with a bit of arrogance, thinking:
 

 
[I must protect her love.]
 

 
When the event ended, Tong Zhao closed the game:
 

 
[When should I start tricking him into taking the bait?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the other side, Han Zhi was at the villa’s bar, mixing drinks for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Wearing a long black trench coat, Han Zhi looked like he stepped out of a Korean drama, making Chang Xiaonian hesitant to look him in the face.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian appeared somewhat reserved: “You might not realize this, but I can really drink a lot. No need to make cocktails; just a bottle of white wine will do.”
 

 
Her tone was slightly lifted, deliberately rough.
 

 
This was at odds with her usual sweet persona.
 

 
She had no choice.
 

 
Despite her constant chatter with her friends about how all handsome guys are jerks, in the presence of a genuinely handsome man like Han Zhi, she felt awkward and uneasy, unable to speak freely. She was somewhat insecure. Therefore, she tried hard to appear casual and carefree in front of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no ambition to be a queen of hearts.
 

 
She subconsciously felt she couldn’t handle someone of Han Zhi’s caliber.
 

 
Regardless of any friendly signals he might give, they only served to heighten her wariness.
 

 
Han Zhi categorized this as one of the troubles of being a handsome man.
 

 
[Using "I'm not interested in you" as a subtext to protect oneself,]
 

 
Han Zhi took out the liquor he was about to mix: [Girls… are really all quite charming.]
# Chapter43
Vodka, Cointreau, lemon juice, cranberry juice...
 

 
Ice cubes clinked crisply as they tumbled into the shaker, followed by colorful liquids swirling through the air, tracing vibrant patterns.
 

 
Han Zhi's cocktail-making was effortless and relaxed, exuding a calm and skilled aura. He didn’t seem like a bartender but more like someone showcasing a personal hobby after work, displaying it only to close friends. His posture and gaze were relaxed.
 

 
Generally, when spending time alone together, one person’s nervousness can affect the other.
 

 
But with Han Zhi, that wasn’t the case.
 

 
He remained completely relaxed.
 

 
He was also patient, willing to wait slowly for his partner to drop her guard, exuding an effortless composure—If you’re nervous, go at your own pace. If you have no ideas, no experience, or no rhythm, that’s fine too. We’ll take it slow, as long as you’re happy.
 

 
Given the distance across the bar, Chang Xiaonian thought she could resist the allure of a handsome man.
 

 
It was definitely better than being alone in a private screening room.
 

 
Whenever she thought about how her slightly flattened nose affected her profile, or how her skin started to oil up after just half an hour indoors, she felt a strong urge to flee. She understood why Zhong Muxi said after watching a movie with Han Zhi—
 

 
[“He’s a really great man, but the better he is, the more I feel inadequate.”]
 

 
At the time, Chang Xiaonian had been fed a lot of the usual "girls are angels" and "you’re a perfect match" motivational talk.
 

 
But when faced with Han Zhi...
 

 
Under different influences, girls are often unable to learn the kind of “beautiful people thinking that any glance from them means interest” confidence.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian gathered her courage and took a furtive glance at him.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Han Zhi was also looking at her.
 

 
His originally indifferent and focused expression softened into a smile as their eyes met, his previously aloof and melancholic face seemed to light up with a smile because of her.
 

 
...
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned, and her heart nearly skipped a beat.
 

 
Help, where did this enchanting man come from?
 

 
The production team expertly captured this moment with a close-up shot.
 

 
Fans who had been waiting for their favorite scenes from the older brother’s segment covered their hearts and cried out:
 

 
[Although I don’t like Chang Xiaonian, I totally understand her reaction...]
 

 
[Brother Zhi’s solo performance, oh my god, it’s so sour I’m in tears.]
 

 
[Ah, I should have signed up for this variety show too! I’m willing to embarrass myself on the show!]
 

 
[Fans, give up. Your subconscious is automatically drawn to variety shows; without needing Han Zhi to charm you, you’ve already given in.]
 

 
...
 

 
"Cosmopolitan, a timeless classic."
 

 
Han Zhi pushed the prepared cocktail towards Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The lights in the bar were somewhat hazy, casting a dreamy hue over the deep red cocktail in the martini glass. It wasn’t overly bright, which would have made it look cheap; instead, it had a subtle elegance. A freshly cut lime wedge perched on the rim of the glass. This cocktail was as common as Chanel No. 5, but being commonplace meant it was very palatable, withstanding the impact of new trends, and it was also suitable for women who were not very familiar with cocktails.
 

 
Besides...
 

 
Most girls cannot resist beautifully colored drinks.
 

 
"Ah, thank you."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thanked him softly and took the glass—
 

 
Before mixing the drinks, Han Zhi had soaked the martini glass in ice water and then wiped it dry, ensuring that the cocktail would present the best flavor when served to her. The glass was pleasantly cold to the touch, and the drink was cool and smooth, with rich, silky liquor and a sweet and tangy fruit aroma.
 

 
While she sipped the cocktail, Han Zhi prepared himself a glass of gin and tonic.
 

 
A gin and tonic is quick to make, with ingredients varying from simple to complex, making it hard to mess up. It can be both very good and very bad, with a high lower limit and a high upper limit, fresh and slightly bitter. After taking a few sips, Han Zhi noticed Chang Xiaonian looking at him and pushed his glass forward with a smile. "Would you like to try this one?"
 

 
This was the glass he had used.
 

 
The ice and liquor in the glass were crystal clear, and through the bar counter, the man’s handsome face appeared to shimmer dreamily.
 

 
Under the mood of the moment, Chang Xiaonian, without much hesitation, took the glass and took a big sip.
 

 
The liquor was refreshing and slightly sweet on the palate. The unique aroma of the gin first washed over her, and as she swallowed quickly, only a hint of tonic water's bitterness remained on her tongue. Strangely, Han Zhi had somehow managed to create a gin and tonic that achieved a level of bitterness without any harshness. Han Zhi, who had prepared the drink, was watching her with a gentle and bright expression...
 

 
The two drinks he made, besides the sweet one for her, were particularly refreshing.
 

 
It seemed like he was just there to enjoy the drinks with her, rather than showing off any elaborate cocktail skills or knowledge.
 

 
Han Zhi knew exactly how she perceived him.
 

 
A handsome, aggressive playboy, a walking heart trap.
 

 
[Action is always the most compelling evidence.]
 

 
[When a woman doubts you, don’t explain. Let her interpret you herself; she will only believe what she has discovered on her own.]
 

 
Unlike Tong Zhao’s proud sarcasm, Han Zhi’s feelings about women conveyed an almost compassionate gentleness.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian propped her chin on her hands and asked, "How many girls have you made drinks for?"
 

 
She regretted asking as soon as the words were out.
 

 
"I haven’t kept count. Guests are guests. Friends often bring their friends to my place for drinks. Some might ask for cocktails they’ve seen on TikTok, like whisky with water. The technique isn’t difficult, but it’s not special—it’s just a lot of work."
 

 
Watering down whisky is a method invented by the Japanese for tasting whisky.
 

 
In summary, it involves adding ice to whisky and stirring it until the ice melts and forms a thin, even layer of frost on the surface, giving it a particularly hazy and beautiful appearance. Achieving this effect requires the bartender to stir constantly for ten to twenty minutes, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It’s annoying enough in a bar, let alone when visiting someone’s home.
 

 
"Have you made any of those?" Chang Xiaonian asked curiously.
 

 
"Mojito, Martini, and Gin and Tonic—pick one," Han Zhi replied with a hint of coolness, which amused her. "I thought you were the type to cater to every request."
 

 
"Not at all. I'm no saint."
 

 
Han Zhi lifted his glass.
 

 
As he tilted it back and drank, his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian found herself swallowing as well.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [So this is how attractive a man looks while drinking?]
 

 
The comments quickly disagreed:
 

 
[No, sister, it’s only him.]
 

 
[Our brother Zhi is a walking X medicine!]
 

 
[For close-up gifs of Zhi drinking, please click on my profile~]
 

 
……
 

 
The bar counter is a clever design.
 

 
Sitting next to each other, they can’t see each other’s facial expressions all the time, allowing for more space for imagination. When speaking softly, their shoulders might lightly touch as they whisper, a small gesture that is warm and flirtatious, like striking a match in the middle of the night.
 

 
Without needing to see Han Zhi’s face directly, Chang Xiaonian felt much more at ease. She joked, "The whisky that takes fifteen minutes to make must be really something."
 

 
"They say whisky made with the water dilution method has the best taste, but I think it’s just a gimmick."
 

 
Han Zhi continued to chat with her in a relaxed manner.
 

 
They chatted about everything under the sun.
 

 
Even without seeing his face, just hearing his deep and captivating voice coming from the left made Chang Xiaonian feel her left cheek tingle and flush. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him. This segment of the conversation was fast-forwarded by the AI during playback, causing a huge backlash from fans. It wasn’t until the special effects commentary explained that a personal cut version would be released that the outrage subsided.
 

 
Alright then.
 

 
Maybe the atmosphere was too good; Chang Xiaonian found herself completely relaxed around him, without the previous discomfort.
 

 
She even understood why Zhong Muxi, who claimed not to like men anymore, had such a high opinion of Han Zhi.
 

 
"Among the three of us, you seem most interested in Wei Zekai," Han Zhi suddenly said.
 

 
"Mm," Chang Xiaonian surprisingly admitted, "He matches my fantasy of love... I've been in relationships, but they never felt right, didn’t meet my expectations, and were different from what’s written in novels. I guess I might not have found the right person."
 

 
The comments were mixed.
 

 
[She never said this much to her girlfriends!]
 

 
[It's a waste of talent that Brother Zhi doesn’t do MLM; he easily gets people to speak their true feelings.]
 

 
[True high-level heartthrob…]
 

 
The production team was anxious as well.
 

 
The director was worried Chang Xiaonian might end up like He Shun and be an easy win.
 

 
It seemed that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were of a similar type—using subtle hints and face-to-face interactions to win people over. This could make the show less interesting. The screenwriter, seeing the director's anxiety, couldn’t help but comment, “This is a common issue with reality TV romance shows featuring celebrities and ordinary people. In real life, how could a stunning beauty like Tong Zhao fail to get a confession? A single flirtatious glance and a man would obediently walk over.”
 

 
The director shot him a sharp look: "This is your script."
 

 
The screenwriter pretended to be deaf and focused on the distant view: "Look at the messy beauty of the tangled wires in the server room."
 

 
“……”
 

 
Back to the variety show.
 

 
"The right person is very important. I believe that love, like any other skill in the world, requires practice," Han Zhi said as he stirred the drink with a long spoon. The sound of ice-clinking became the background music for his words.
 

 
He was skilled at listening, but his speaking was also charming. Even if he recited *Capital* by Marx, it would likely have the romantic poetry of sonnets and *The Flight of the Bird*: "Loving someone and accepting their affection requires repeated learning. A single instance is a rare miracle, but such miracles are often continuously depicted in literary works."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian responded with a bitter smile: "I do long for that kind of love, you know, not a rationally chosen fit, but something that makes my heart race and feel like it might burst at any moment. But when I see the other person, it feels like it's worth even dying for…"
 

 
At this moment, she almost regarded Han Zhi as a good friend to vent to.
 

 
This was the moment when Han Zhi, the handsome man, was the most indistinct in her mind as a "love interest," with the least amount of suspicion.
 

 
[If we keep this conversational pace, she might really have no feelings for me the next day.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed calmly.
 

 
Before Chang Xiaonian could finish speaking, she felt a weight on her shoulder.
 

 
Han Zhi leaned in, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and gently pulling her toward him, maintaining a slight distance without real physical contact. Chang Xiaonian looked up, her gaze fixed on the man’s handsome, alluring face, the sharp lines of his jaw, and the half-smiling curve of his lips, which were imprinted deeply on her retina.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was momentarily stunned and didn’t push him away.
 

 
She swallowed hard.
 

 
"Do you feel this way about me?"
 

 
Han Zhi’s demeanor shifted from his previous gentleness to a cold and distant gaze, yet his slightly shallow eyes were filled with an unspoken, lingering affection.
 

 
How could this kind of emotion be acted out?
 

 
Under the close-up shot, the director couldn't understand at all.
 

 
This scumbag’s acting was just too damn good.
 

 
But it wasn’t acted out.
 

 
Han Zhi’s character was shaped by the experience of Chang Xiaonian’s initial transformation into a man. Seeing women from a male perspective, he understood how much harder it was for them, which fostered a kind of affectionate empathy towards women. Thus, he could easily fall in love with someone; this feeling wasn’t fake or acted.
 

 
He hoped every girl could find happiness.
 

 
“Uh…”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned.
 

 
Her immunity to handsome men vanished in an instant.
 

 
Her senses were numbed, only able to hear the sound of her racing heart and Han Zhi’s previous words playing back in her mind with Dolby surround sound, making her almost forget to breathe.
 

 
“Don’t lie.”
 

 
Han Zhi lowered his gaze, his tone slightly stern.
 

 
Was the earlier gentleness all just an act? Under the close-up of his handsome face, Chang Xiaonian lost her ability to think normally, responding instinctively, “Yes…”
 

 
“Heart racing fast?” Han Zhi’s thin lips curled into a faint smile.
 

 
After a moment, Chang Xiaonian regained a bit of her composure, turning her face away awkwardly and taking deep breaths, “Help, this is too much. Don’t scare me like this, I can hardly breathe…”
 

 
“Have a sip of something cold to calm down.”
 

 
Han Zhi released her and pushed a glass of whiskey towards her.
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
After catching her breath, Chang Xiaonian straightened up, blushing as she stared at the glass.
 

 
She focused on the drink, as if it were engraved with a thousand words, enough to make her escape reality for half an hour.
 

 
Panicked, extremely panicked.
 

 
She hadn’t felt this way even when alone with Wei Zekai!
 

 
The last time they cooked together, she had been so annoyed by Wei Zekai’s two flirtatious moves that she wanted to scold him. Rich second-generation types were so clueless and pretentious, how arrogant!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stared at the glass for a while, suddenly noticing something different about the whiskey.
 

 
The thin layer of frost on the inside of the glass made the pure golden liquor appear to be wearing a dreamy veil, obscuring its structure. In a flash, she remembered that during their conversation, she had avoided looking directly at Han Zhi out of evasion toward handsome men. In the pauses between their words, she could also hear the sound of the long spoon stirring the drink.
 

 
This was the water-cut whiskey Han Zhi had prepared for the guest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian held the cold glass with both hands, feeling the warmth of her palms and her heart.
 

 
She asked hesitantly, “Didn’t you say this was troublesome and you didn’t want to make it?”
 

 
“Were you not curious about how a drink that takes fifteen minutes to make would look?” Han Zhi reached out and touched her ear, as if the polite gentleman before was just a facade. With millions of viewers witnessing Chang Xiaonian’s rising affection for him, he sighed and said, “And the feeling of your heart racing with excitement... Since you want to know, I’ll satisfy your curiosity.”
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was low and husky, and the spot where his large hand touched her tingled.
 

 
Fortunately, she was sitting; otherwise, Chang Xiaonian felt her legs might give out.
 

 
She took a sip of the whiskey.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [Damn, why does this whiskey taste sweet?]
 

 
Whiskey, of course, should not be sweet.
 

 
Even if it could show you images of the Virgin Mary and the Himalayas with a single sip in "The Drops of God," whiskey is fundamentally spicy and bitter. Even though it becomes smoother after water-cutting, the only reason for a sweet taste would be if her taste buds were malfunctioning.
 

 
The brain controls all the nerves.
 

 
So, it must be a problem with the brain.
 

 
When you feel moved by someone else, your brain is already beginning to malfunction.
 

 
The comments:
 

 
[Woman, something’s wrong with you.]
 

 
[The drink stirred for 15 minutes by my brother, even if it were just plain water, would still taste sweet.]
 

 
[How much money do I need to spend to get a VIP experience and see things from this female guest’s perspective?????]
 

 
Female viewers vented their excitement through comments, while male viewers took notes on these techniques that would never be used in real life.
 

 
Han Zhi cast a lazy glance over.
 

 
“Do you want to try that heart-racing feeling again?”
 

 
He didn’t give the young lady strong liquor, but the other drinks he made were strong. With his slightly tipsy eyes now even more poetic, he poured tons of hormones onto Chang Xiaonian’s heart. The audience behind the screen could hardly handle it, and she, facing this human-like walking aphrodisiac, couldn’t hold out either.
 

 
[Should I refuse him?]
 

 
[This is ridiculous; he’s actually a jerk, isn’t he?]
 

 
[Maybe he’s extremely dangerous...]
 

 
These were Chang Xiaonian’s thoughts.
 

 
What she said out loud was:
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Without hesitation, Han Zhi pulled her into his embrace.
 

 
This time, there was no polite distance; she fell solidly into his arms. She could smell a faint hint of incense on him... There was no tobacco scent as described in novels; he might not smoke at all, but she couldn’t help but inhale deeply against his chest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian wanted to listen to his heartbeat to see if it was speeding up for her.
 

 
Unfortunately, her own heartbeat was pounding so hard that she couldn’t hear anything else.
 

 
“Do you feel like a heroine in a romance novel now?” Han Zhi asked with a smile, more like teasing her.
 

 
If he had acted like this from the beginning, no matter how handsome he was, he would have received a slap.
 

 
The problem was that he was too good at setting the atmosphere, gradually breaking down her defenses.
 

 
Han Zhi had pinpointed the young woman’s vulnerabilities.
 

 
She wanted an unreal romantic adventure like in a novel, a domineering man who would lead her by the nose—an experience that Wei Zekai couldn’t provide. [That young master is barely capable of handling Tong Zhao, let alone this...] Han Zhi thought with indifference as the girl in his arms asked earnestly:
 

 
“Han Zhi, are you using a Casanova card?”
 

 
Caught out!
 

 
It turned out Chang Xiaonian wasn’t completely clueless!
 

 
The audience suddenly tensed, and the production team was delighted; finally, something was developing in the direction they had hoped for.
 

 
“Jerk, your day has come!” The assistant director rubbed his hands in anticipation.
 

 
The most interesting part of reality shows is when the seemingly unbeatable side falters.
 

 
The screenwriter coolly poured cold water on the situation: “Don’t get your hopes up too high. Hearing Han Zhi’s low voice, he could easily explain anything. Even if he said the sun rises in the west, some women might believe him.”
 

 
The stagehand raised her hand in support: “I would!”
 

 
Everyone agreed.
 

 
Given Han Zhi’s level, it was easy to charm a young girl.
 

 
…
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi pinched her chin, lifting it to force her to meet his gaze. His lips curled slightly: “Are you going to expose me?”
 

 
[???]
 

 
[Self-destruct card? Why self-destruct?]
 

 
Rarely, the production team backstage was just as stunned as the audience.
 

 
He could have easily completed the task with a lie.
 

 
From the increasing affection, it was clear Chang Xiaonian was thoroughly smitten. If Han Zhi guided her a bit more intentionally, she might fall even more for him than she did for He Shun.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian’s cheeks and eyes reddened: “Were you deliberately flirting with me?”
 

 
She was both embarrassed and annoyed.
 

 
Indeed, if it weren’t for the Casanova card, how could a handsome guy like Han Zhi be so nice and gentle to her? It was just about the reward…
 

 
Before she could escape his embrace, Han Zhi caught her hand and placed it on his chest.
 

 
Han Zhi whispered, “After seeing you, I really enjoyed the mission it gave me.”
 

 
What she felt in his palm was a heartbeat much faster than usual.
 

 
It turned out Han Zhi was just like her…!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian quickly pulled her hand away, tears on the brink of falling, but her lips curved into a smile, clearly pacified.
 

 
So, did the Casanova really fall for her?
 

 
[Alcohol is truly a great thing.]
 

 
[Low-tier Casanova gets girls drunk, whereas I just need to get myself drunk.]
 

 
Han Zhi curled his lips.
 

 
A line of special effects text slowly appeared on the screen, accompanied by the sound of keyboard typing:
 

 
“Ethanol in alcohol stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which may increase the heart rate.”
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……Impressive, Casanova!]
 

 
[Please, go line up with Tong Zhao already; stop torturing the low-tier level!]
 

 
[Only I can seduce myself/dog head!]
 

 
Han Zhi still held her, his internal monologue coldly mocking the production team’s naivety: [People always misunderstand what lovers truly want. Her question about whether I’m using a Casanova card wasn’t about being deceived, but about feeling that I don’t actually love her and that I’m only flirting with her reluctantly to complete a mission. This realization has hurt her pride, making her feel embarrassed and angry…]
 

 
[Well, as long as she knows that I do have feelings for her, that’s enough.]
 

 
[Love has no right or wrong; the more emotional a person is, the simpler their desires.]
 

 
[If you don’t delve into your lover's true needs, you’ll end up in a miserable state of endless arguments and conflicts.]
 

 
[The most important thing is, I don’t like to deceive women.]
 

 
[Here, there is no sadness, only love.]
 

 
The Casanova’s inner monologue shattered countless audience hearts.
 

 
The dating reality show had officially turned into an emotional drama.
 

 
Under the shocked gaze of millions of viewers, Chang Xiaonian became even more attached to Han Zhi upon learning his true identity.
 

 
Why is this happening?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian herself didn’t understand why she felt this way.
 

 
But Han Zhi understood—
 

 
[Once I know that I have clear points of attraction for her, she relaxes a lot, which is a good sign.]
 

 
What’s most frightening is that Casanova understands women better than women do.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian hesitated and filled in his name on the heart-throb app.
 

 
As a reward, Han Zhi lifted her face and gave her a light kiss on the forehead.
 

 
In short, he could fulfill every cliché of a romance drama.
 

 
“Alright, you win. You don’t need to pay any more attention to me from now on, okay?” Chang Xiaonian turned her face away and joked.
 

 
But the camera captured her eyes welling up with tears.
 

 
“You seem to misunderstand me,”
 

 
Han Zhi, both amused and exasperated, turned her face back to look at him and said, “I won’t let go until you learn to confidently accept someone’s affection.”
 

 
The audience was overwhelmed by how much this line sounded like a romance novel.
 

 
What kind of man can even say something like that?
 

 
“So how are you going to teach me?” Chang Xiaonian was quite taken by this approach.
 

 
“Let’s start by getting you used to looking directly at me.”
 

 
[... I just want to know what her reaction will be when she finds out that her idol and the girl she dislikes are the same person after leaving the holographic chamber.]
 

 
[Upvote 1]
 

 
[Also, Han Zhi, please start a class for us male fans!]
 

 
[Don’t teach anymore, it’s embarrassing.]
 

 
Meanwhile, in the corridor on the other side...
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was about to go downstairs to make a late-night snack, crossed paths with a dog wagging its little tail.
# Chapter44
What to do, what to do, what to do!
 

 
Since it had shrunk, everything seemed like a game from the perspective of Wei Zekai. It could almost feel a huge flashing red "Danger" character above its head... Right in front of it, Tong Zhao was towering over, staring at it. The little tail that had been wagging so happily froze, slowly drooped, and tucked itself between its legs.
 

 
Nervous.
 

 
Maybe it should turn around and run. How could a mere human catch it!
 

 
Unfortunately, by the time Wei Zekai thought of this, it was too late.
 

 
Tong Zhao had already walked up to it, bent down, and grabbed the loose skin on the back of its neck: "Why is there a dog here?"
 

 
She had been living here for quite some time and had seen plenty of koi fish in the garden, but not a single small animal. Even the guard dog was nowhere to be seen. Chang Xiaonian had sighed in relief about that, saying she was terrified of dogs and was on edge when they entered—after all, in movies, estates like this are typically guarded by a whole pack of black German Shepherds.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook the little dog in her hand: "This one doesn’t look like it could guard anything."
 

 
...
 

 
"Woof!"
 

 
What do you mean? Feeling underestimated, Wei Zekai burst into a rage and barked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
He couldn't stand being looked down upon.
 

 
Just like when he's playing games—if the opponent dares to taunt him, he’ll dive into the tower and rush to the enemy's base to trade one-for-one, no matter the risk. He always felt this was a basic move for a man of honor, a principle he sticks to, and becoming a little dog wouldn't change that.
 

 
How about that, super fierce, right?
 

 
In that small body was hidden big energy, and Wei Zekai bared his canine teeth to scare her.
 

 
This was Wei Zekai’s point of view.
 

 
He thought he was terrifying.
 

 
However, from the audience's third-person perspective…
 

 
[Hahaha, where did this little puppy trying to be fierce come from? Too cute!]
 

 
[Never thought the show’s mascot would be a rich kid, so adorably soft! Come home with me, little one.]
 

 
[Does he really think he’s intimidating?]
 

 
Quick-fingered netizens had already hit replay, captured GIFs, and added captions like [Roaring Tiger.gif].
 

 
Tong Zhao, of course, wasn’t scared.
 

 
But she did sense that the dog was trying to act tough towards her.
 

 
How coincidental, she’s not someone who can handle provocation well either.
 

 
Tong Zhao's soft lips curved into a faint smile: "So fierce, huh? Are you daring enough to bite me?"
 

 
As she spoke, she extended her hand toward the dog’s mouth.
 

 
In an instinctive reaction, even pet dogs will bite.
 

 
Tong Zhao had raised dogs before, and from the way it barked, she could tell it was all bark and no bite—a harmless pet dog.
 

 
When that soft, white hand reached the dog’s mouth, Wei Zekai froze—
 

 
What are you doing!
 

 
He’s not really a dog after all; he’s still quite conscious of gender, so he quickly turned his head to the side.
 

 
“Heh.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, holding him by the scruff of his neck with one hand and supporting his little Dog bottom with the other, walking toward her room: "No need for a midnight snack; let's play something else."
 

 
Naturally, Wei Zekai wasn’t willing to be taken to the room.
 

 
It kicked its legs, struggling to break free, but didn't dare show its claws. As a result, Tong Zhao pressed it into her arms, forcibly subduing it.
 

 
And then it quieted down.
 

 
Because where she pressed it... was soft and fragrant —
 

 
Its little tail wagged, and the entire dog gave up.
 

 
Wei Zekai swore, he never intended to use his ability to transform into a dog to take advantage of girls. And because of his integrity, the intelligent AI didn’t detect any inappropriate thoughts, so it didn’t issue any warnings... This proved that, even though the little dog’s face was pressed into an indescribable place, his thoughts were completely innocent.
 

 
But the audience wasn't so pure.
 

 
[Let go of that dog, let me take its place!!!!]
 

 
[I can't wait to see how awkward he'll feel when he gets his memory back after this.]
 

 
[Wei Corgi can't breathe / dog emoji]
 

 
["A Blessing in Disguise"]
 

 
"You're quite obedient."
 

 
Tong Zhao originally thought it would struggle for a while, but unexpectedly, it quieted down as soon as she pressed it into her arms. After entering her room, she quickly shut the door, cutting off Wei Corgi's escape route. When she finally released her hold on it, it immediately slumped against her shoulder, gasping for fresh air.
 

 
‘Phew… almost suffocated me to death.’
 

 
‘Good thing it didn’t last long, or I’d have lost my dog's life.’
 

 
Wei Zekai’s inner thoughts, still filled with lingering fear, sparked outrage from the audience.
 

 
Unbelievable, this guy doesn't know how good he has it!
 

 
Tong Zhao patted its back: "It's boring being alone. From now on, I’m your owner."
 

 
Dog Wei: Huh?
 

 
Dog Wei: You think you're worthy of being my owner? Really think I’m just a dog? You’re nothing.
 

 
As he spoke, Dog Wei barked twice at her, trying to act fierce again.
 

 
For the moment, he didn’t think about jumping down, but then he saw Tong Zhao carrying him toward the bathroom.
 

 
[!!! Is she going to bathe with the dog?]
 

 
[So exciting! Is this really content they can air? Not treating us like outsiders at all, huh?]
 

 
[GKDGKDGKDGKDGKD!]
 

 
When the bathroom door closed, Dog Wei really started to panic. He jumped to the floor, frantically scratching at the door and barking loudly, clearly signaling Tong Zhao to let him out. Unfortunately, she ignored him and began filling the bathtub halfway with water. After testing the temperature and making sure it was right, she turned back to the supposedly fierce little puppy with a gentle smile.
 

 
Sensing something, Dog Wei turned around too.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao taking a bath wouldn’t be aired.
 

 
But bathing a little dog? No problem.
 

 
“Woof? Woof! Woof woof woof!”
 

 
Wei Zekai froze, half his body being pressed into the warm water.
 

 
He kicked and splashed wildly in the tub for a while, and when he realized that the splashing water was getting Tong Zhao’s clothes wet, he didn’t even dare to resist anymore.
 

 
The viewers weren't happy about this.
 

 
[Come on, move a little, doggi! Just move a bit!]
 

 
[We don't need the extra traffic, turn it up a notch, please.]
 

 
[Give it a rest. Even if her clothes do get wet, the AI would blur it with extreme pixelation before anyone can screenshot it. Don’t underestimate how well this show protects the guests’ privacy.]
 

 
With a stunned expression that could shake an entire family, Dog Wei was thoroughly scrubbed all over. It wasn’t until Tong Zhao dried his fur with a blow dryer that he snapped out of his shock, though his inner thoughts were still filled with doubts about his dog life—
 

 
Did I just get bathed by someone?
 

 
What do I do!?
 

 
...It felt kinda nice though...
 

 
As Wei Zekai's rationality returned, he remembered that he only had one hour in this transformed state. He had to escape before the hour was up, or his identity would be exposed! But no matter how much he struggled, Tong Zhao held him tightly, leaving him utterly hopeless—
 

 
Damn it, why did he have to turn into a Dog?
 

 
If only he were a large dog, he wouldn't be so powerless right now!
 

 
"Struggling so much... is it because you don’t want to be my dog?" Tong Zhao asked, looking down at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sensing a glimmer of hope, nodded frantically.
 

 
Yes, he remembered that Tong Zhao was supposed to be a gentle, sweet girl who wouldn’t make things difficult for a dog.
 

 
Just as he thought this, he saw Tong Zhao’s elegant and sweet face curl into a smirk.
 

 
Gentle and sweet?
 

 
Her usually clear, light-colored eyes were now swirling with arrogance and mischief. The malice in her gaze pierced Dog Wei's confidence like tangible tendrils. With his keen dog hearing, he clearly caught her next two sentences:
 

 
"I like dogs that don't like me."
 

 
"From now on, you're my dog."
 

 
...
 

 
Dog Wei was baffled.
 

 
Gentle and sweet? That doesn’t exist—she was just playing with them.
 

 
Behave now, it's time to kneel and call her master.
 

 
Tong Zhao patted his head.
 

 
In her mind, however, she thought, ‘This dog is too smart; it must belong to someone.’
 

 
She decided to keep an eye out for any missing dog posters over the next couple of days, but for now, she'd play with him before returning him to his owner.
 

 
Dog Wei kicked his back legs against her shoulder, hoping to bring back the gentle and kind girl he thought she was. However, his defiant legs were quickly caught in her hand. "You're all clean now, time for bed," she said as she carried the little dog toward the bed.
 

 
The audience collectively let out a sharp "hiss."
 

 
Dog Wei began to struggle.
 

 
By this time, only five minutes remained before his transformation would wear off.
 

 
On-screen, the poor little dog was shown with its limbs restrained. Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, grabbed his tail, saying, "I’ve got your little tail, behave."
 

 
Dogs aren't naturally tailless. Originally, tails were docked for cattle herding purposes, but later it became a cosmetic trend for pets.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s dog, who still had his tail, now had his weakness held in Tong Zhao's hands.
 

 
‘Crap! Let me go, let me go, let me go!’
 

 
Dog Wei’s inner thoughts were a complete mess.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew exactly how to handle small dogs. Although she had him firmly under control, it didn’t hurt him. His mind was completely blank.
 

 
Finally, with three minutes left, Wei Zekai managed to brush against a ticklish spot on Tong Zhao’s waist. As she loosened her grip from the tickling, he rolled off the bed, sprang up, and used his front paws to press down on the door handle, slipping out through the gap in the door. By the time Tong Zhao rushed out after him, she saw the little corgi scrambling and rolling in a series of tactical maneuvers, running straight into Wei Zekai’s room.
 

 
Moments later, the door closed behind him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Huh? So this dog belongs to Wei Zekai?’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Come to think of it, they do seem alike.’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘But I’ve never seen him walk a dog... And after all that noise just now, he didn’t come looking for it, which is kind of weird. Though I was the second-to-last one to arrive at the manor, so maybe he settled in earlier. Hmph, if he owns a dog, Chang Xiaonian's dream of marrying into a rich family might be shattered, since she’s afraid of dogs.’
 

 
Without a dog to cuddle anymore, and feeling a bit tired after all the commotion, Tong Zhao regretfully got ready for bed.
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai, now back in human form, swore he would never turn into a dog again!
 

 
That was way too terrifying!
 

 
He locked the door from the inside and threw himself onto the soft bed, his heart pounding wildly.
 

 
“Damn it, stop thinking about it, just pull up the blanket and sleep!”
 

 
According to the Polar Bear Law, the more you try not to think about something, the more vividly it comes to mind. The brain, it seems, is everyone’s biggest traitor. Wei Zekai was now facing this very dilemma—
 

 
He hadn’t realized it when he was barking, but just now... where had his face been buried on Tong Zhao?
 

 
Crap?
 

 
That night, some slept soundly, while one “dog” struggled to sleep at all.
 

 
※
 

 
The next day at noon, while out for a group activity, Wei Zekai was approached by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Casually, she asked, “Do you have a dog? Last night I saw one running into your room.”
 

 
“No!” Wei Zekai denied it in an instant. “You must’ve seen wrong.”
 

 
“...”
 

 
Tong Zhao had only asked offhandedly.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reaction was way too strong—so strong that it was suspicious. She was sure she hadn’t seen wrong. The dog had definitely run into his room, and the door had only closed after the dog went inside, which meant someone had been in there. She lowered her eyes and didn’t press further. “Hmm, I guess I must have been mistaken.”
 

 
She was so easygoing, it was like she wasn’t the same mischievous girl from last night.
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t help himself and kept sneaking glances at her face.
 

 
Her side profile was just as flawless as her full face, with her nose and lips shaped perfectly. When she looked at someone, she often smiled before speaking, which made her seem especially sweet.
 

 
So why was she so unfriendly to dogs?
 

 
Recalling last night’s ordeal, Wei Zekai still felt lingering fear.
 

 
It was the first time he had been grabbed by the scruff of his neck, had his tail pulled, and then been dunked into a bathtub like that.
 

 
His intense reaction caught Tong Zhao’s attention—
 

 
Wei Zekai had already been her second target to pursue, so she had been watching his every move closely.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: There’s definitely something strange about that dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao's thoughts:
 

 
“The door was only ajar and got pushed open by that little corgi. When a dog is panicking, why didn’t it run down the stairs? Obviously, Wei Zekai’s room made it feel safer. Wei Zekai is lying... With his personality, if he didn’t want me near his dog, he would’ve said so directly instead of lying.”
 

 
One suspicious point after another surfaced.
 

 
Viewers sighed:
 

 
[Give it up, Young Master Wei, you can't outsmart her.]
 

 
Though the idea of someone turning into a dog seemed too far-fetched, Tong Zhao was still heading in the right direction.
 

 
After all, anyone with the "Judge" identity card would have special abilities.
 

 
Maybe the official gave him a well-trained dog to spy on other players’ moves, which would explain why he lied to cover it up. Otherwise, why would he hide the dog? If Wei Zekai was the Judge, she would need to be extra cautious. At the very least...
 

 
She couldn’t let him suspect that she was the "Sea King."
 

 
She needed a convincing reason to get closer to Wei Zekai.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Even though I don’t really want to use this method...”
 

 
From her tone, the viewers could tell she was genuinely reluctant.
 

 
But what method was she thinking of?
 

 
[Seduction! Seduction! Seduction!]
 

 
[Wake up, those of you chanting for seduction! Do you really think that’s going to work on the last clean soul in our rich kids' circle? No way.]
 

 
The director aptly cued in a heavy, suspenseful beat as background music.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned in slightly and extended a very crucial invitation:
 

 
"Wanna duo later?"
 

 
For someone of her caliber, using gaming skills to lure a guy was a bit of a downfall.
 

 
But this was exactly the bait Wei Zekai would fall for.
 

 
Playing with a skilled partner who could work well with him was too much fun, and a look of hesitation immediately appeared on his handsome face. After a brief struggle, he nodded reluctantly:
 

 
"Alright!"
 

 
Damn it, he couldn’t resist the temptation of a duo match!
 

 
Not far away, He Shun, noticing the two of them chatting animatedly, started to feel uneasy. However, when he saw that they were just playing a popular mobile game, he felt relieved:
 

 
He Shun: "Oh, they’re just gaming."
 

 
He Shun didn’t realize that playing games together, especially in a duo, was an excellent way to strengthen emotional bonds.
 

 
Viewers who were into pure love found it amusing.
 

 
After seeing a lot of flirting, a dose of wholesome interaction wasn’t bad for a change.
 

 
However...
 

 
These two really were *just* playing the game.
 

 
Tong Zhao, multitasking, tried to steer the conversation toward relationships, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not:
 

 
"You're pretty good at this game. Do you often carry girls?"
 

 
"Women only slow down my sword speed!"
 

 
[......]
 

 
"So, you’ve never dated anyone?"
 

 
"Never dated, doesn’t matter," Wei Zekai said with a smile after securing the first kill in the game. "Love isn’t a necessity. If I had to say, I’m more interested in protecting other people’s love right now."
 

 
Even though he didn’t want to turn into a dog again, Wei Zekai still remembered his duties as the Judge.
 

 
And that night, the scene of Zhong Muxi self-harming in the kitchen...
 

 
That was someone unrelated to him, but he really didn’t want to see another tragedy.
 

 
[Alright, that's quite pure.]
 

 
[If it weren't for the fact that instinctive variety shows can’t fake things, I'd suspect this is a rich kid playing a character.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, the cold and ruthless swordsman just wants to protect others' love. Is this setting making you ship him?]
 

 
The director zoomed in on Tong Zhao.
 

 
You could see her lips twitch slightly after hearing that, on the verge of smiling but also a bit shocked.
 

 
Clearly, she was unimpressed by such idealistic talk about “protecting others' love.”
 

 
As viewers watched, they realized that the down-to-earth Tong Zhao was a bit mischievous.
 

 
Somewhat unkind but not over the top.
 

 
Far more interesting than the flat, clichéd characters in traditional variety shows.
 

 
After an afternoon of gaming, the two of them had become an unbeatable team and collected many stars. However, Tong Zhao felt that advancing her strategy with Wei Zekai was still a long way off. The director appropriately revealed the affection ratings between them:
 

 
Wei Zekai’s affection for Tong Zhao was at 70%, with the note: “He already considers you a reliable ally!”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s affection for Wei Zekai had dropped to 30%, with the note: “An incomprehensible single-celled organism, should stay single forever.”
 

 
The viewers were in stitches.
 

 
It seemed even the "Sea King" had hit a snag!
 

 
[The feelings are there, but if you ask what kind of feelings, I’d say it’s a friendship bond.]
 

 
[Hahaha, poor Tong Zhao, I want to see how the strategy with Han Zhi is progressing.]
 

 
There wasn't much eye-catching progress on Han Zhi's side.
 

 
However, his solo cut had the highest purchase rate among the six guests, even surpassing Tong Zhao.
 

 
The reason was simple: he was accompanying Chang Xiaonian in playing a romance game.
 

 
As long as fans paid to become premium members and got Chang Xiaonian's first-person perspective, it was practically like dating Han Zhi. No female fan could resist this kind of temptation! Except for kissing, everything else was included—hand-holding, hugging, and Han Zhi always found new ways to make her happy, fulfilling all her romantic fantasies from romance novels.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t require her to keep their relationship a secret, but she still kept quiet about it.
 

 
She didn’t want him to dislike her or cause him any trouble.
 

 
But there was one thing...
 

 
“Han Zhi, your remaining tasks should be pursuing Xiao Xi and Tong Zhao, right?” Chang Xiaonian asked out of the blue while playing board games in the game room. She actually knew the answer but still wanted to ask.
 

 
Perhaps immersed in the sweet and happy atmosphere, Chang Xiaonian no longer referred to Tong Zhao as “that woman.”
 

 
She seemed to have lost her previous resentment towards others.
 

 
Even though she knew that her relationship with Han Zhi was temporary and had a time limit, she didn’t grow to love him more. Instead, she felt better about herself. Han Zhi looked at her with admiration—if such a handsome guy thought she was great, why should anyone else think otherwise? She believed she would meet the right person and deserved all the tenderness.
 

 
In the past, Chang Xiaonian’s view of others was very black and white, like in those face-slapping novels.
 

 
Showing various favors to men was seen as being a green tea bitch.
 

 
He Shun was a typical straight man.
 

 
Wei Zekai was an arrogant, overbearing rich second-generation.
 

 
Han Zhi? He must be the kind of guy who knows how to play the game well and is a scumbag everyone should avoid.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian first spent time alone with Han Zhi, she had placed herself in a very low position...
 

 
But now things were different.
 

 
"Hmm," Han Zhi said, grabbing her hand as she was shuffling the cards. "Since you keep bringing up other girls, I'll punish you by holding my hand for a minute."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian smiled brightly, intertwining her fingers with his, and said with a tone of concern, "If you keep talking about other girls, you could increase the punishment. How about holding hands for half an hour? I don’t know Tong Zhao well, so I’m not worried about her. As for Xiao Xi, she was dumped by a scumbag before, and... I saw an old scar on her wrist, which might indicate she has a tendency for self-harm. I’m not good at comforting people, and we only see each other occasionally at events. If you’re interested in pursuing her, could you be a bit nicer to her? I think you could make her happy."
 

 
She was very clear that a man like Han Zhi was beyond her control.
 

 
Having a period of time with good memories was already a blessing.
 

 
Moreover, she did indeed hope for a genuine romantic relationship.
 

 
"Let’s end our relationship here. I can’t wait to use the methods you taught me to love someone else," Chang Xiaonian said frankly, treating him as a tool.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t annoyed. In fact, he was quite pleased that she was speaking openly to him.
 

 
However...
 

 
The dynamics of dominance and submission still needed to be managed carefully.
 

 
He gently lifted their clasped hands, placed a kiss on her wrist, and glanced at her, his perfectly sculpted nose brushing against the back of her hand. “Don’t you want me anymore?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
The young woman was immediately flustered and overwhelmed.
 

 
After her face reddened and she calmed down a bit, it was half an hour later.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, having made her decision, left with a big smile, making Han Zhi feel even more like junk food—something not to be overindulged in but which brings a smile when consumed. As he thought this, he began to clean up the remnants of their game.
 

 
Just as he was tidying up the board game toys, he heard the sound of the door opening behind him.
 

 
“How surprising,”
 

 
came Tong Zhao’s lazy voice. “She didn’t cry and run away?”
 

 
“I don’t like making girls cry.”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t turn around, knowing she would approach.
 

 
Sure enough, he heard the footsteps getting closer.
 

 
“Wow, a scumbag who doesn’t like making girls cry, sounds like you have some principles,” Tong Zhao sneered and walked up behind him, seeing the board game "Operation Code" on the table, revealing a bored expression. “Is this what you bring girls on dates to play?”
 

 
“There are other games. Do you want to try? There’s a queue.” Han Zhi still didn’t turn around, his tone a bit indifferent.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pair of slightly cool, soft hands wrapped around his neck from behind, lifting his chin to make him face her directly.
 

 
“I have things I dislike doing and things I enjoy doing,”
 

 
She said, her charming face holding up under this hellish angle. Han Zhi saw her eyes crescent-shaped with mischievousness, clearly a bad woman. His expression remained neutral, but his usually warm face turned unusually cold and distant, indicating that Tong Zhao’s mention of other girls had touched a sensitive spot.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t care at all.
 

 
Not only did she want to step on his sensitive spot, but she also wanted to dance on it with unrestrained joy.
 

 
“First, I hate waiting in line, so I’m going to cut the queue.”
 

 
“Second, unlike you, I actually enjoy making men cry.”
# Chapter45
In East Asian cultural environments, male tears are often suppressed.
 

 
Men's tears are rarely shed, and men are expected to bleed without crying…
 

 
It all sounds quite tragic for men, but it also creates a certain appeal— the more they resist showing vulnerability, the more one wants to peel away their strong facade, to see their genuine emotions. In the moment of their collapse, to kiss their tears, accept their sharp edges, and embrace their weakness.
 

 
With her delicate hand, Tong Zhao gently caressed Han Zhi's chin, her mind filled with an unspoken dark amusement.
 

 
In the close-up, her fingertips lightly traced over his Adam's apple.
 

 
[Ugh, Tong Zhao really has the face of an Omega with the demeanor of an Alpha.]
 

 
[Male viewers might be confused—what is an Alpha?]
 

 
[For the male viewers up front, don’t leave. I’ve got a file on the topic to discuss with you…]
 

 
Han Zhi grasped her wrist and lifted his eyelids, looking at her with an expressionless face.
 

 
His eyes, hidden behind his lashes, were deep and intense, as if they might pull someone in, never to return.
 

 
“Want to make me cry? That’s a bit of a challenge.”
 

 
She touched his cervical vertebra.
 

 
The bone, connected to the muscles, held a latent explosive strength like a leopard. Her cool fingertips traced over his muscle lines, which were all describable parts, yet the atmosphere between them was rapidly approaching an unbroadcastable red line: “What about your gentlemanly conduct towards women? Come on, cry for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled with a provocative and unruly attitude.
 

 
Han Zhi found himself somewhat at a loss with this type of behavior, feeling as if he had missed a step. It was a mix of reluctance and anger—why was she so domineering with him? However, his tolerance for women was particularly high. He took the opportunity to pull her into his lap and kissed her ear: “Stop messing around… If I cried, it wouldn’t be anything special. ‘Pear blossoms bring rain’ is used to describe women, right? You’d definitely look better crying than I would.”
 

 
“That’s true.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She herself had used fake crying to achieve her goals before.
 

 
Once she was seated in his lap, the audience began anticipating more risqué scenes.
 

 
However, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, they exchanged information.
 

 
“I know you won’t reveal other girls’ private matters, but it seems you’ve taken care of Chang Xiaonian,” Tong Zhao said confidently, leaving him no room to refute. Han Zhi silently looked at her, knowing that explaining wouldn’t help, and indeed, her statement was true: “So, you’ll need to win me over.”
 

 
Although it wasn’t explicitly stated, both were aware of each other's Sea King cards.
 

 
Similar to games like "Werewolf" and "Blackout", recognizing identities wasn’t the end of the game. Their interests didn’t conflict but instead had the potential for a win-win situation. He needed Tong Zhao’s decisive choice, and she equally needed his.
 

 
The most likely outcome was that they would exchange contact details, with mutual selection leading to the successful completion of their tasks.
 

 
Han Zhi could have pushed back at this moment.
 

 
But he smiled, his expression gentle as he let her lead, appearing as if he was at her mercy: “My Queen?”
 

 
“...Ah, so tacky,” Tong Zhao pinched his perfectly straight nose. “Are you deliberately hitting my sore spots? Scumbag.”
 

 
“Wronged, Master.”
 

 
The more he called her names, the more excessive it became. Han Zhi couldn’t help but laugh, rubbing against her neck like a big dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew him too well. He wasn’t even remotely like a canine. While wolves understand the need to obey the alpha, this man, under his obedient facade, had a heart as restless and wandering as a stray. If he were to be described, he’d be like a wild leopard that’s hard to tame—comes around for food and then runs off quickly when uninterested. Infuriatingly so, yet he had such a stunning coat and an endearing voice.
 

 
At that moment, she heard unusual noises coming from the game room door.
 

 
But her attention was quickly drawn back by Han Zhi.
 

 
“Let’s talk about your situation,”
 

 
Han Zhi noticed a small, particularly cute mole on her neck: “How are things with that young master? He doesn’t seem to be a match for you.”
 

 
...
 

 
It was exactly the wrong topic to bring up. Tong Zhao wanted to roll her eyes at him.
 

 
But she held it in.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most stereotypical straight man she’d ever met, as if he hadn’t fully awakened to his secondary sexual characteristics. Under his handsome face was only a straightforward life of enjoyment—no romance involved. But she didn’t want to lose face in front of her peers, so she took the opportunity, while he was focused on her neck and couldn’t see her expression, to sigh deliberately: “What’s he playing at? He’s such an innocent kid who can’t handle the game. He’s quite cute. I plan to have a serious talk with him.”
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been examining the mole on her neck, was stunned by her words: “...A serious talk?”
 

 
It was as if he had heard some urban legend.
 

 
“Yeah, I like him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said openly, and when she saw him trying to lift his head to look at her, she quickly rubbed her face against his cheek: “It’s the first time I’ve met this type, and I really like him. I have to treat him well.”
 

 
This statement couldn’t be called half-truth; it was pure nonsense.
 

 
However, with someone like Han Zhi, it’s hard to discern the truth from lies when he can’t see someone’s face. Tong Zhao’s voice was sweet and enchanting, making it difficult for him to make a correct judgment. Moreover, he had to admit... Wei Zekai did have a pretty impressive appearance.
 

 
He couldn’t help but ask: “You really like that type?”
 

 
“Never tried it before.”
 

 
This answer was highly credible to the King of Sea, immediately convincing Han Zhi.
 

 
He bit her neck as if in frustration: “Have you tried my type?”
 

 
[He’s getting anxious!]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s accidental advantage turned out to be superior; she’s ahead this time!]
 

 
[I’d call Wei Zekai the ultimate tool man!]
 

 
The audience felt it, and Tong Zhao naturally picked up on the subtle details in Han Zhi’s tone.
 

 
Although he quickly masked his displeasure in the subsequent conversation, as if nothing had happened, Tong Zhao knew very well. In high-stakes situations, even the tiniest flaw can lead to a total loss. She had only intended to cover up her inability to handle Wei Zekai, but it unexpectedly stirred up Han Zhi’s jealousy.
 

 
So, he can be jealous too?
 

 
It was a bit cute, and the speed at which he suppressed that emotion was quite amusing.
 

 
After catching his little slip, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but smile with a touch of schadenfreude.
 

 
Is jealousy a sign of affection?
 

 
Not necessarily, but at least it indicates a bit of interest. Tong Zhao completely believed in his self-control, but it was like taking a kill from a strong opponent—it was worth celebrating. She felt a great sense of accomplishment, almost wanting to flip this big leopard over and play with its snowy white belly.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him sideways: “Caught red-handed, huh? Do you really like me that much?”
 

 
“You…”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at her mischievous smile and knew exactly what she was thinking.
 

 
It was impossible to make her stop, so he could only helplessly laugh and hug her: “What’s the next development supposed to be? Director Tong, give me some guidance. Are we heading to the 'chasing wife cremation ground'? I haven’t chased anyone before. Teach me, and cut me some slack.”
 

 
“‘Chasing wife cremation ground,’ seriously.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed heartily.
 

 
She couldn’t understand why this guy had so many words that hit her sore spots!
 

 
Han Zhi, defending himself after listening to her complaints, said with justification: “Because I’m a writer.”
 

 
“Well, the Chinese literary world is fortunate to have you. It’ll be doomed sooner or later.”
 

 
Tong Zhao issued a dismal missive to the literary world.
 

 
Han Zhi thought this woman was great in every way except for her foul mouth. Deciding to take action, he lowered his head and kissed her lips. The kiss was intense and hard to part from, but at that moment, the director switched the camera.
 

 
[……Director, no more chicken legs for you tonight!]
 

 
[Where’s the director’s Weibo? Everyone, flood it with complaints!]
 

 
[Reasonably suspecting this is a scam to get VIP members to buy the cut version viewing rights. You think we’ll fall for it? Others might not know, but I’ve been duped. Crying while recharging for this King of Sea couple/Smile/Smile]
 

 
The camera cut to just outside the game room, where they encountered He Shun.
 

 
“Tong Zhao, are you avoiding me?”
 

 
He quickly stepped forward, grabbing Tong Zhao's hand with a voice full of confusion and anxiety.
 

 
The audience, who had been angrily cursing the director, instantly had their attention diverted—
 

 
This was definitely a chaotic scene!
 

 
Had things gone off the rails?
 

 
How would Tong Zhao handle it?
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her captured wrist. Although she didn’t struggle to provoke him, her inner voice was already cursing him out: [Crazy. Why not just talk if you want to? Why grab me?]
 

 
The production team remained unmoved and even found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
With Han Zhi’s previous example, the crew had already realized that ordinary people couldn’t handle these two sea kings. A few words were enough to appease them, almost at a level of brainwashing worthy of a multi-level marketing leader. If their views weren’t so warped, developing a harem might not be out of the question.
 

 
Assistant director: “The highlight should be the sea kings teaching how to establish a harem, right?”
 

 
“He Shun is no match for Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“It’s hard to say. He Shun is obviously a very possessive man. Chang Xiao Nian has gained confidence and self-awareness under Han Zhi’s influence, and her infatuation with him has faded. This allows her to remain calm about his pursuit of other female players,” the screenwriter analyzed, convincing others.
 

 
Just as everyone behind the scenes and the audience were convinced that Tong Zhao could easily handle He Shun, she did not resort to her usual tactics of softening, acting cute, or feigning distress. Instead, she narrowed her eyes coldly and said, “Avoid you?”
 

 
He Shun did not notice her unusual expression and questioned her with a sense of righteous indignation: “You haven’t talked to me since the end of the class. I wanted to find you, but you were always with that rich young man. I didn’t have a chance to talk to you. If it weren’t for following you... never mind, that’s not the point. You owe me an explanation. Also, what were you doing in the game room with him?”
 

 
Before their relationship was defined, He Shun had already shown a strong sense of control over his “little girlfriend.”
 

 
Having tidied up the board game toys and preparing to leave, Han Zhi was called out just as he was about to step out the door. His handsome face showed an awkward expression, like he’d stepped on his tail, which was quite amusing.
 

 
The camera pulled back, capturing all three of them in the frame, creating a scene reminiscent of an idol drama’s chaotic moment.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Ah, this...]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Let's observe for now. If there’s any violent behavior, I’ll need to protect the queen.]
 

 
[So good at acting, Brother Zhi!]
 

 
[I think he just wants to annoy Sister Zhao. Clearly, she doesn’t like being called 'queen' by him, haha...]
 

 
[These two are hilarious, jumping from a restricted scene straight into a comedy.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Sigh, I hope Tong Zhao performs normally and I don’t have to step in.]
 

 
Immediately, Tong Zhao took action to show him that not only was she performing well, but she was also exceeding expectations.
 

 
She looked at He Shun with a calm demeanor, a mix of novelty and pity.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly.
 

 
"Do you think you’re worthy to boss me around?"
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao’s thoughts and spoken words matched in their cold and arrogant tone.
 

 
He Shun clearly didn’t expect this side of his delicate and fragile goddess, and he was left stunned by her previously obsequious and now contemptuous attitude. Tong Zhao observed his expression for a moment—
 

 
She and Han Zhi were clearly not on the same path. Han Zhi would never treat his suitors like this, and as for the imperial concubine? Apart from being the supreme ruler, everyone else was only fit to kneel and serve her: "Alright, for humanitarian reasons, I’ll let you die understanding the truth. I’m already fed up with your self-praise while tutoring students and your visible disdain for women. Every time you criticize those two women, I almost throw up."
 

 
"But," He Shun struggled to accept, "I was just speaking the truth."
 

 
"Ah, consider this a free lesson from me. Listening to you is like putting money in your pocket. Criticizing other women in front of your beloved? Do you think I’d be pleased? No, I’d just think you’re of low class."
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t have much liking for the other two female players either.
 

 
The "true self" of Concubine Chen had always been forged in the palace’s fierce struggles, with competitors of the same sex deeply ingrained in her subconscious. This was her extreme and one-sided part. But for someone like He Shun…
 

 
What to say?
 

 
It was like a eunuch pointing fingers at the concubines—no matter if the target was just an occasional attendant, the concubine still wanted to give him a good kick, sending him to the torture chamber; it was a matter of principle.
 

 
Taking advantage of He Shun’s shock, Tong Zhao freed her wrist from his grip and rubbed her delicate white wrist.
 

 
She had basically concluded that Wei Zekai was the judge, and at worst, someone with the last name Chang or Zhong, though it was unlikely. If it were Chang Xiaonian’s doing, she probably would have reported her name in the app by now. Based on her observations over the past few days, He Shun’s behavior didn’t seem like that of someone holding a special identity card.
 

 
“Do you remember what you said to me? Chang Xiaonian’s desire to marry into a rich family is too obvious; no man would like such a materialistic woman. Zhong Muxi’s looks are average and too gloomy, and at her age, she should be doing more housework to show herself, otherwise, she’ll waste her whole life.”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao paused: [Does saying this make it seem like I’m venting on their behalf?]
 

 
This thought hit her sore spot, causing goosebumps to rise on her arm.
 

 
[Imagining Concubine Chen defending her sisters in the harem hahahaha]
 

 
[ Let me touch her face!]
 

 
[Director: The character setting has collapsed!]
 

 
Never mind how others interpret it. Seeing the men’s worldviews crumbling, she couldn’t help but mock him with a delighted expression: “Do you think you can control everything and have already handled me? Let me give you a piece of advice: treating all women as fools will only make you look like a bigger fool.”
 

 
The offensive language was toned down.
 

 
But from Tong Zhao’s tone and expression, the audience perfectly received the message she intended to convey.
 

 
He Shun, realizing he had been fooled, was enraged: “You… you deliberately approached me to mislead me! I treated you so well, and now I will expose you to others. As long as the judge knows your true colors, you’re out of the game!”
 

 
“Yes, indeed,”
 

 
After laying it all out, Tong Zhao’s smile didn’t fade. She took a step forward and asked softly, “So, who do you think will believe you? Is it Wei Zekai, who has climbed to twenty stars with me in duo mode, or those two girls you look down on? Do you really think they haven’t noticed your disdain for them? Fool, playing this kind of game without building good relationships and exchanging information with others, it’s quite laughable.”
 

 
He Shun’s expression stiffened.
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
He looked down on those two women, and their relationship with him was also weak.
 

 
They politely addressed him as ‘Teacher He’ on the surface. During their last event, they almost had a fight. He kindly advised Chang Xiaonian to be more practical and not live in her own world, but she was ungrateful and said it was her own business.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In love, isolating yourself is the worst mistake.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In tactics, belittle the enemy, but in strategy, respect them... Sigh, though I can’t really criticize him for this. In the realm of same-sex relationships, my connections are either cold or antagonistic.]
 

 
She pouted.
 

 
The comments flooded with female fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Ah, they really like Sister Zhao!
 

 
He Shun, unable to tolerate it any longer, swung his arm to give her a piece of his mind. Observing from behind, Han Zhi couldn’t stay still and quickly stepped in to block He Shun’s raised hand. Tong Zhao, completely expecting this, sarcastically addressed Han Zhi from behind him: “So you’re getting all worked up just because I hit a nerve? Do you want to fight? I’m sending Han Zhi to handle you!”
 

 
She was almost about to say, “Pikachu, I choose you!”…
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips twitched.
 

 
This woman’s genuinely unpleasant personality always made him unable to suppress a smile.
 

 
Upon seeing Han Zhi, He Shun’s assumptions and suspicions quickly connected.
 

 
His pride and self-esteem wavered as he cursed, “...What a pair of dog-men and women!”
 

 
With that, He Shun shook off Han Zhi’s restraint and stormed out.
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been scolded, turned to the cause of the trouble: “Isn’t it easy to smooth things over with him? Why bother?”
 

 
“Difficult, extremely difficult,” Tong Zhao shook his hand playfully, acting spoiled: “It’s nearly impossible for me to hold back from giving him a scolding. Oh my god, did you see how he came to question me—why should I put up with it? He’s not even my boyfriend and thinks he has any authority over me.”
 

 
Han Zhi nodded in understanding: “Sounds very infuriating.”
 

 
When it comes to infuriating people, Tong Zhao is truly a master at provoking hatred.
 

 
However, Han Zhi strangely had little empathy for men. It was as if he was born to think from a woman’s perspective, only wanting to protect the girls' interests.
 

 
Tong Zhao noticed his skepticism and raised her right hand for him to see: “Look, my wrist is red from where he grabbed me.”
 

 
Indeed, there were red marks on her fair wrist from where He Shun had grabbed her. Her pale skin made the bruises even more conspicuous.
 

 
The Empress had never been subjected to such grievances and immediately showed her displeasure.
 

 
Seeing the girl’s wrist injured, Han Zhi’s already limited sympathy turned into genuine concern for Tong Zhao. He sighed, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to get some medicine.”
 

 
“But you have to cooperate with me in the act,” Tong Zhao pressed on.
 

 
Han Zhi knew she was likely to bruise easily but also recognized she was genuinely upset, so he indulged her: “Alright, as a seasoned actor, I’ll play along with whatever you need.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, pleased with the response.
 

 
At the time, no one expected that this would turn out to be a prophetic statement.
 

 
Returning to the current situation:
 

 
He Shun was furious, his anger making him stomp heavily with each step.
 

 
He had feelings for Tong Zhao, an elevated admiration, slightly pleased by this little beauty’s admiration of him. He enjoyed making her dance around him and was thrilled with even the smallest favors. He had never expected that she was actually deceiving him the entire time!
 

 
He was confident that he would not become prey to the “sea king.”
 

 
It was just a woman’s trick.
 

 
In the presence of an experienced and successful man like him, he could see through such things at a glance.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so well-behaved, unable to hide anything from him, her face easily reddening.
 

 
It was probably that ambitious woman who got the female Sea King card! Unfortunately, he was a man she could never control. The young and impulsive Wei Zekai might have a chance, but He Shun had little regard for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
However, however...
 

 
He Shun’s mind was in complete disarray.
 

 
Viewers of variety shows instinctively love moments of genuine emotion, whether it involves someone’s misfortune or not. It feels authentic and engaging. It’s like some old American reality shows, which often staged dramatic confrontations and outbursts in front of the camera, airing crass lines that would make educated and respectable people cringe, yet still managed high ratings.
 

 
No matter how civilized the times become, the public’s appetite for drama remains unchanged.
 

 
He Shun walked into the public area of the lounge.
 

 
Wei Zekai was nowhere to be found, and the two girls were watching TV.
 

 
He was somewhat displeased, assuming that Wei Zekai was hiding away to play games again, missing in crucial moments. However, on second thought, having only the two girls was not so bad. They seemed to have always disliked Tong Zhao. He once overheard Chang Xiaonian call Tong Zhao a "green tea."
 

 
He Shun approached them and, with a serious demeanor and a determined tone, made a shocking revelation:
 

 
“Tong Zhao is the sea king among us. She deceived my feelings!”
 

 
……
 

 
………
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi, sitting closely on a small sofa, looked up at He Shun.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not talkative, but Chang Xiaonian couldn’t hide her confusion and curiosity: “Huh?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Are we even that close?]
 

 
Tong Zhao was right; their relationship was not good at all.
 

 
The identity of the female sea king did not threaten the interests of the two girls.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought it was rather foolish for a man like He Shun to seek their help to seek justice after being emotionally hurt.
 

 
Not only did she not sympathize, but she also found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
[Doesn’t he look down on women a lot? How can he be deceived by a woman and then seek help from another woman?] Chang Xiaonian’s inner thoughts voiced a portion of the audience’s sentiment: [What does it have to do with me? Help, every time he speaks, it just makes Brother Zhi look even better. I hope my future boyfriend isn’t like this guy, please.]
 

 
If He Shun had arrived a bit earlier, Chang Xiaonian might have shared his antagonism.
 

 
After all, in many black-and-white online novels and short videos, green tea bitches and white lotus flowers are universally condemned.
 

 
However, after receiving Brother Zhi’s care, she had become more forgiving towards flowers and plants. She felt a bit embarrassed about her previous behavior of gossiping behind Tong Zhao’s back. Although she couldn’t apologize directly, at least she didn’t feel the impulse to join in the bashing when others tried to slander Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Don’t you understand this at all?”
 

 
Although He Shun was already aware that women typically react slower than men, he was still a bit impatient: “She intentionally seduced me and then revealed her true colors after I confessed to her…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked with curiosity: “What exactly are these true colors?”
 

 
He Shun, enraged, replied: “She rejected me!”
# Chapter46
Chang Xiaonian mumbled, "... Oh."
 

 
He Shun sighed in relief, "Do you understand now?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian didn't really understand.
 

 
If it were one of her close friends, even if the confession was rejected by a man and she knew everyone had the right to refuse, she would still help her friend by cursing out the guy to let off steam, and only after she calmed down would she offer advice.
 

 
But He Shun...
 

 
He's someone she has no real connection with!
 

 
Moreover, didn't He Shun seem quite confident last time? He told her to be clear-headed, saying that if a girl wants to find a partner, she needs to learn to actively do housework, otherwise, no one would want her, and then he eagerly went to be a tool for Tong Zhao. And now he got rejected? Serves him right for being so narrow-minded!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no intention of defending him.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn't catch on as quickly; she seemed a bit slow and continued to be puzzled, "Why is getting rejected a sign of being a sea king? Maybe she just doesn't like you?"
 

 
"She was leading me on and misleading me!"
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked, "What specific actions misled you?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian suddenly remembered that this friend of hers was a science prodigy and also a bit rigid.
 

 
He Shun argued indignantly, "Whatever I did, she praised me and would blush when talking to me."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Blushing, what a sophisticated fishing tactic!]
 

 
"Teacher He," Zhong Muxi asked with even more confusion, "I remember you were tutoring her. Isn’t it normal for a student to praise the teacher? As for blushing, that’s just blushing. Is there any more convincing evidence? With the way you spoke just now, I thought she at least mentioned liking you or something similar.”
 

 
[Don’t ask anymore, He Shun is getting anxious.]
 

 
[Is this the power of a straight woman?]
 

 
[I’m already starting to feel embarrassed for He Shun. I hope his business partners don’t see this episode.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi sighed, "If there's no verbal evidence, do you have any actual progress in your relationship? Have you hugged, held hands, or kissed?"
 

 
"No, but..."
 

 
He Shun opened his mouth to argue.
 

 
However, under the barrage of questioning, he not only stuttered but also suddenly realized deep down—
 

 
Yes, Tong Zhao had never made any promises to him.
 

 
Why had he always been so sure that she was interested in him? Moreover, with his experience, he knew that attraction between men and women before establishing a relationship is unreliable; you might be into each other one day and indifferent the next.
 

 
[The empress knows how to see through people’s intentions.]
 

 
[Her previous analysis of He Shun was spot on.]
 

 
Noticing the shift in the comments, the special effects team timely inserted a previous psychological analysis by Tong Zhao regarding He Shun:
 

 
[He Shun is a man overflowing with confidence who looks down on women, believing that women are naturally inferior to him in terms of physiology, psychology, and intelligence. It’s easy to handle someone with this mindset. People who treat others as fools in interpersonal relationships are the most likely to end up with a big fall.]
 

 
[He’s arrogant, so he magnified the feelings I showed.]
 

 
[He looks down on women, so he thinks I can't escape his grasp.]
 

 
[It would be best if he develops a complex about women and stops putting on a show in front of them.]
 

 
The last comment had the audience in stitches.
 

 
At this moment, Han Zhi hurriedly walked into the living room and asked, "Where’s the first aid kit?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stood up, "I’ll get it for you. What happened?"
 

 
He Shun’s irritation flared up.
 

 
Just now, when he was talking to Chang Xiaonian, she was cold and indifferent.
 

 
He Shun thought Chang Xiaonian was just pretending to be aloof, as she acted the same way with all men. But then she was so attentive to Han Zhi...
 

 
Recalling how Tong Zhao had shown off behind Han Zhi, He Shun was consumed with jealousy: “Now you’re just her lapdog? I’m telling you, that woman isn’t so simple. Don’t let yourself be used without even realizing it.”
 

 
[Although you’re confident when pointing fingers at girls, your powerless rage looks really pathetic.]
 

 
[I love the literary genius of the comments.]
 

 
[Handsome men and beautiful women are a match made in heaven, and it’s ridiculous for you to oppose it!]
 

 
After finding the first aid kit, Han Zhi finally looked at He Shun, his eyes cold and frosty:
 

 
"Just because she rejected your confession, you want to resort to violence? If helping her find medicine is exploitation, then I’m willing to do it."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just finished playing a game and came out to watch, heard this and asked, "Who got hurt?"
 

 
"I saw He Shun confessing to Tong Zhao in the hallway. After she rejected him, he wouldn’t let her leave, and her wrist ended up with a large bruise."
 

 
Han Zhi spoke clearly and logically. He generally got along well with everyone, and even Zhong Muxi, who was most resistant to men, thought he was a good man. When he spoke, the scales of reason naturally tipped in his favor.
 

 
"I didn’t lay a hand on her!"
 

 
He Shun denied it.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pale-faced Tong Zhao walked out from the hallway leading to the game room.
 

 
It was unclear how she managed to make her face look so pale.
 

 
Earlier, when she had been mocking He Shun, her complexion was rosy and healthy, as if she had had a little to drink.
 

 
Han Zhi ignored his explanation. After Tong Zhao sat down on the sofa farthest from He Shun, he took out some ointment and applied it to her. Everyone could clearly see that there was a red mark on Tong Zhao’s wrist, evidently caused by someone grabbing her too hard.
 

 
He Shun’s face instantly turned dark.
 

 
He had indeed held her hand for a while...
 

 
But was it really that hard?
 

 
He wasn’t sure.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who looked delicate and used to pretending to be pitiful, now sat quietly on the sofa with her long lashes casting shadows over her bright eyes. She lowered her head, exposing a slender, pale neck that, like her arms and legs, seemed fragile and easy to break. Honestly, when she was quiet, she fit the straight male fantasy of pure and weak, easily controllable.
 

 
She was so beautiful and delicate, like a porcelain doll, that it evoked a flood of sympathy from the audience who were fans of attractive people.
 

 
Even Chang Xiaonian, who generally had a neutral opinion of Tong Zhao, couldn’t hold back: “Acting out after a failed confession, you’re the one revealing your true colors!”
 

 
He Shun’s lack of communication skills was glaringly exposed.
 

 
The director displayed the approval panel; He Shun’s approval rating had dropped to only 10.
 

 
It was roughly at the level of “if something bad happened to him, people might still send flowers in sympathy, but they don’t want to interact with him any further and find him annoying.”
 

 
He Shun’s disdain for others didn’t mean he wanted to be a public figure.
 

 
Feeling the strange looks from everyone, he anxiously explained, “I was just so angry at the time, and I didn’t hit her. I was just afraid she would run away and not listen to me properly. It wasn’t that serious! Right, it must be fake, like with blush or lipstick…”
 

 
[Next, He Shun will perform a segment of “The More You Explain, The Worse It Gets.”]
 

 
[Will he really find a girlfriend after this show airs? Just asking.]
 

 
[Maybe. I’ve heard he’s quite wealthy and not bad-looking among rich people.]
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, poured more ointment, and applied it to the wound.
 

 
There was no sign of the bruise spreading.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [His understanding of women is shockingly shallow and stereotypical.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi: [I need to stay away from him in the future.]
 

 
“Did you hurt your hand? Is it serious?” Wei Zekai ran down the stairs from the second floor, squatted beside Tong Zhao, and examined her injury with concern. This action surprised the audience, especially the two playboys and added weight to the notion that “Tong Zhao genuinely likes him,” which annoyed Han Zhi a bit.
 

 
[Wei Zekai is awakening? The Wei-Zhao faction is ecstatic!]
 

 
[Not bad, the younger brother is making progress.]
 

 
However, the AI's analysis quickly shattered the audience’s illusions:
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Injured your hand? Will it affect your performance? Damn, He’s caused a lot of harm.]
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……………]
 

 
The comments were filled with ellipses.
 

 
Wei Zekai, a man who silenced the comments!
 

 
Seeing his malicious assumptions crumble on their own, He Shun became increasingly flustered in his defense: “Why are you all looking at me like that? I didn’t do it on purpose. How was I supposed to know she was so fragile? I swear I really didn’t mean to hurt her. If I had intended to, it wouldn’t just be a bruise on her wrist. Can I just apologize? I’m sorry!”
 

 
As he spoke, He Shun became more agitated.
 

 
He genuinely believed he was in the right.
 

 
The mistake was misjudging Tong Zhao; he didn’t expect her to be such a malicious woman.
 

 
He merely held someone’s hand while talking for a moment, and now it’s his fault that her wrist is bruised? He feels incredibly unlucky.
 

 
He was innocent but fell victim to a bad woman. It’s truly unfortunate.
 

 
People who are arrogant can’t hide their emotions, and his insincere apology only further diminished any goodwill.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s injury was not serious; if He Shun had apologized with a good attitude, people would have calmed down and understood it objectively. But instead, he made things worse by exposing his problematic mindset while trying to explain.
 

 
He genuinely believed that injuring a wrist didn’t count as hitting someone.
 

 
Tong Zhao should be thankful that he didn’t actually intend to hit her.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was fuming.
 

 
But she felt that her relationship with Tong Zhao wasn’t close enough to defend her.
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, couldn’t listen any longer.
 

 
“Are you done yet? Why should Tong Zhao listen to you? If she doesn’t want to hear what you have to say, maybe you should reflect on whether you’re just talking nonsense. Ok, if you want an answer, she rejected you! It’s straightforward and clear. Or do you not understand human language? Do we need to send you a dream to explain it? Fine, if that’s what it takes, people from the underworld can handle such things.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was a young master known for his prowess in various online games.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t have the face to scold him, but Wei Zekai did so without hesitation.
 

 
If it weren’t for the invisible force (the system tries to prevent guests from saying restricted lines) holding him back, He Shun’s family tree might have already started facing trouble.
 

 
After being berated by someone he viewed as just a pampered kid from a wealthy family, He Shun angrily retorted, “What’s it to you!”
 

 
“You injured her hand, so of course it concerns me!”
 

 
He Shun yelled, but Wei Zekai yelled even louder.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao already suspected about 50% of the reason behind Wei Zekai’s fury, but to keep up the act, she still showed Han Zhi a somewhat smug smile, resembling a pampered little princess.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mind was as quick as his speech: [Damn it, Tong Zhao’s hand shouldn’t be hurt. That’s the hand used to coordinate with me to take down the opponents!]
 

 
“What did I say wrong? Are you angry because your confession failed? Didn’t you injure her hand?”
 

 
He Shun thought about it and realized that the young master was probably right.
 

 
“I’m not angry because of embarrassment; I’ve seen through her true nature. I didn’t expect all of you to be deceived by her,” He Shun said with deep disappointment, looking at the two girls. The two men had become nothing more than Tong Zhao’s lapdogs in his eyes. He added another gem of wisdom: “If you want to maintain your dignity, you shouldn’t be on her side. Good girls should draw a clear line from that kind of person!”
 

 
This was clearly stirring up trouble.
 

 
But it was also He Shun’s honest opinion.
 

 
He wasn’t a woman-hater; in fact, he liked and needed women very much.
 

 
But what he liked were good women.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously been seen by He Shun as the ideal obedient girl, while Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were too lacking in femininity and didn’t satisfy a man’s sense of self-esteem. However, it now seemed that Tong Zhao was the most unforgivable bad woman!
 

 
He hoped the two girls would wake up and realize that they shouldn’t blindly support their own gender.
 

 
Just like those women who say, “Although I’m a woman too, I think blabla…”—that’s the kind of clear-headed and sensible girl in his eyes.
 

 
Such a classic idea that can provoke gender conflicts was fully displayed to the audience.
 

 
Reality shows are just this authentic.
 

 
The more controversial the topic, the fewer celebrities are willing to appear on the show.
 

 
The same goes for ordinary people.
 

 
Fortunately, there are many people in China, so with such a large pool, it’s always possible to find suitable guests.
 

 
He Shun thought his subconscious must be as mature and wise as he is, full of male charm.
 

 
He didn’t think he would cause any public relations crisis—
 

 
After all, his views and thoughts are in line with mainstream society.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was a bit overwhelmed by being yelled at by a man and moved closer to her friend.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian glanced at him disdainfully: “Crazy.”
 

 
After saying that, she dragged her friend upstairs, clearly unwilling to get involved.
 

 
With Young Master Wei Zekai protecting her, there was no need for them to rush to defend Tong Zhao. However, He Shun’s irritating nature was fully displayed. They decided to avoid him in the future to prevent him from “accidentally” bruising someone’s hand because he wanted them to stop and listen to him.
 

 
After He Shun threw his tantrum and was ignored, he left in a huff.
 

 
Han Zhi finished applying the ointment, confirmed that Tong Zhao didn’t need anything else, and then left.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt sorry for his teammate and sat down next to her to comfort her: “Does your hand still hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes and spoke softly: “A little.”
 

 
“I see,” Wei Zekai said with great concern, “Does that mean you can’t play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
She had guessed correctly.
 

 
So the guy’s anger earlier was because his duo queue partner was out of commission.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were a guy, she’d be fine now, but his heart would be aching.
 

 
Who wouldn’t have a tough time trying to win over Wei Zekai’s heart?
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Retreating in the face of difficulty doesn’t fit my aesthetics. Go for it, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
Tong Zhao pouted: “You only care about the game, and I’m not important at all?”
 

 
“How could that be?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t stand being misunderstood.
 

 
He suddenly placed his hands on her shoulders, looked intently into her eyes, and said:
 

 
“You’re an important teammate to me!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [……]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can’t keep this up. Just let it be destroyed!]
 

 
Tong Zhao steadied herself and gathered her thoughts.
 

 
Wei Zekai, being a young guy, needed a gradual approach. She couldn’t be too hasty: “You can play games. It doesn’t affect anything. Do you want to play now? We can go to your room.”
 

 
“My room?” Wei Zekai was puzzled.
 

 
“I’m afraid of seeing him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her head, looking like an adorable, aggrieved little thing.
 

 
Wei Zekai understood and accepted the suggestion to go to his room, and he patted his chest, reassuring her: “Don’t worry, with me around, that old man wouldn’t dare lay a finger on you!”
 

 
Tong Zhao realized he wasn’t impressed by being admired, so she skipped the grateful look.
 

 
This fool, it’s already good enough that she didn’t give him a disdainful glance.
 

 
※
 

 
When they arrived at the estate, Wei Zekai, the super-rich second-generation who had criticized the shabby estate, had no qualms about choosing the best suite. Although Tong Zhao didn’t look around, she had quietly observed with her peripheral vision and indeed noticed some clues.
 

 
The dog hair left on the floor was clearly from that little dog.
 

 
“Your room seems bigger than mine. Is the bedroom the same?”
 

 
“Why don’t you go check?”
 

 
Each suite had its own small living room, bathroom, and bedroom.
 

 
With the owner’s permission, Tong Zhao glanced into the bedroom and indeed found noticeable golden-brown dog hair on the white bed sheets.
 

 
“I’ll go wash my face and clear my head,” Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sprawling out on the living room sofa, nodded to show he heard her.
 

 
The bathroom also had traces of dog hair.
 

 
Not having a dog was indeed a lie from Wei Zekai.
 

 
But there were no sounds of dogs in the room—
 

 
Unless specially trained, it’s rare for dogs not to bark when a stranger enters the room. At least for small dogs, their tolerance in this aspect… maybe it’s Tong Zhao’s prejudice, but having been barked at by Pomeranians and Chihuahuas before, she thought corgis couldn’t control themselves.
 

 
An immature idea gradually took shape in Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
As usual, she played games with Kai Wei, but her frequency of speaking was much higher than before.
 

 
“Where is their jungler?”
 

 
“He should be taking his own red buff.”
 

 
“What skills did the enemy use in the last team fight?”
 

 
“The ADC used Cleanse.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao’s questions weren’t complicated, some were simple enough to answer without much thought.
 

 
With the continuous high frequency of questions, Wei Zekai gradually developed a reflexive response.
 

 
Finally, when the timing seemed right, Tong Zhao asked, “What about that little dog?”
 
“It’s playing the game with you.”
 
……
 

 
[Psychology Master, I bow to your wisdom!]
 

 
[Seriously? This works? Is Wei Zekai’s IQ all used up for playing games?]
 

 
[Impressed by the devotion, haha]
 

 
Tong Zhao subconsciously felt that this tactic was effective on him.
 

 
It definitely wouldn’t work on Han Zhi.
 

 
After hearing the answer, Tong Zhao fell silent.
 

 
Realizing what he had said, Wei Zekai's hand shook, not only did he misfire his ultimate, but he also inadvertently punished the ADC’s cannon, receiving a frustrated question mark from the ADC: “Damn, I didn’t hear clearly just now. What dog? I don’t know… Hey, can you control the enemy mid-laner? They keep messing around in my jungle!”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t press the issue any further.
 

 
She had a premonition that, given Wei Zekai’s thought process, the real reason behind things might be much stranger than she imagined.
 

 
For this private gathering, Tong Zhao's progress: She reached six stars in the game.
 

 
Meanwhile, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were discussing the afternoon’s incident with a sigh.
 

 
“Even if Tong Zhao really is a sea king… I suspect she has a lot to do with it. After all, Xiao Xi, you’re not, and I’m not, so it must be her!” Chang Xiaonian analyzed confidently, “Anyway, it’s not our business. That guy He Shun’s behavior is just too ugly. He deserves to be played around with; hitting a woman is simply unforgivable!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi, hugging a pillow, softly agreed: “I don’t like He Shun.”
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi defend Tong Zhao made Chang Xiaonian feel a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
But then she realized it was just part of the official task.
 

 
Zhong Muxi worriedly asked her: “By the way, are you okay? It seems like Wei Zekai has a good relationship with Tong Zhao…”
 

 
She knew her close friend had always been fond of Wei Zekai.
 

 
Whether it was for money or if she was materialistic was not something she considered.
 

 
She was concerned about her friend's feelings.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was taken aback but then waved her hand: “I’ve long stopped liking him! This time I’m not getting involved in the activity, but I’m quite happy.”
 

 
Even though she hadn’t found a suitable partner, she had experienced a sweet and dreamy romance.
 

 
She was very satisfied!
 

 
“That’s good.” Zhong Muxi felt relieved.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian looked at her friend intently.
 

 
In theory, she should remind her that Han Zhi is that sea king.
 

 
But considering Zhong Muxi’s many old injuries…
 

 
Recently, she had been keeping a close eye on her, eating and sleeping together. When Xiao Xi lost control of her emotions, she would cry on her shoulder, which helped control her self-harming urges. But she couldn’t be with her forever… Maybe Han Zhi could do what she couldn’t.
 

 
Forget it, let’s observe for now.
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi were like parallel lines; aside from being forced together during a game of Truth or Dare, they had no intersecting points.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was quite curious about how he would make his move.
 

 
But he seemed unaffected.
 

 
And in this estate, there was someone else who was also concerned about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It wasn’t Han Zhi, it was Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had vowed to stop being a lapdog, but he continued to pay attention to the crying, self-harming girl. He thought if something similar happened again, he’d swoop in and take away her fruit knife—he had practiced jumping many times in his room for this, truly an elite among dogs.
 

 
After He Shun was isolated, the atmosphere in the estate became a bit strange.
 

 
People with sensitive and fragile mental states are most easily affected. Although it wasn’t Zhong Muxi’s fault, her condition continued to deteriorate day by day. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t do much about it and had to leave it to Han Zhi to figure out a solution.
 

 
Han Zhi was surprised: “You’re creating opportunities for me to pursue your friend?”
 

 
“To make her happy,” Chang Xiaonian corrected him, “I’m involved too, so don’t mess things up.”
 

 
Han Zhi was a bit surprised, then touched her head: “Why does it seem like you’re doing better and better after leaving me?”
 

 
“It’s always been this way; it’s too late to regret now.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian accepted his praise calmly and hummed a happy tune.
 

 
Under her matchmaking, the three of them frequently spent time together.
 

 
He Shun saw this and felt he had once again misjudged— not only was Tong Zhao a schemer, but even Han Zhi, who he had thought well of before, was just another pretty boy spinning around women. And those two girls were even more foolish.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was surprised that Han Zhi didn’t enjoy having two women accompany him as much as He Shun imagined.
 

 
He came up with some entertainment activities but invited Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao to join.
 

 
Under the condition of “mutual support,” Tong Zhao reluctantly attended.
 

 
Han Zhi’s strategy was effective; Zhong Muxi’s smile gradually increased.
 

 
One time, after swimming in the pool and feeling tired, the three girls sat by the poolside, sipping on the frozen juice Han Zhi had prepared in advance, and chatted idly. Zhong Muxi said enviously, “Han Zhi is amazing, he has everything prepared. I’m almost embarrassed.”
 

 
“What’s there to be embarrassed about?”
 

 
The favored concubine, who saw all men as tools, looked at her in confusion.
 

 
Since distancing herself from He Shun’s male chauvinism, Tong Zhao had increasingly revealed her true nature in front of everyone. Her hand, which would never heal, was taken care of by Wei Zekai, who accepted that girls were more delicate and helped her with tea and water, after all, she was an injured comrade, and it was right to take care of her!
 

 
After several gatherings, Chang Xiaonian had a good understanding of what Tong Zhao was like.
 

 
She was basically a princess with a disorder.
 

 
The green tea act was fake, and she didn’t like to speak ill of other girls.
 

 
She looked at Tong Zhao with considerable patience.
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao belatedly remembered her mission as a supporting role and reluctantly added, “If you’re embarrassed, next time you can prepare things together with him.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian questioned, “What about you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied very calmly, “I have a hand injury.”
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao flashed a delicate smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile was beautiful, but Chang Xiaonian read the underlying message from it—
 

 
"Expect me to do the work? Not gonna happen."
 

 
How could someone use such a beautiful face to maintain this "I’m too delicate to handle hard work" attitude!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned by her shamelessness.
 

 
For a moment, she was speechless, losing her ability to talk.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t notice the underlying tension in their conversation; she thought Tong Zhao had a point.
 

 
Although she didn’t want to be a caretaker for men, she was willing to join in on the preparations. She vaguely sensed that these gatherings were arranged for her, and she felt grateful but also wanted to contribute something for everyone.
 

 
[Oh no, Xiao Xi is such a good girl, Brother Zhi, go save her!]
 

 
[So obedient...]
 

 
[To spoil the mood, this kind of thinking can easily lead to the favored concubine bossing her around…]
 

 
The audience before the live broadcast fell silent for a moment.
 

 
Everyone has a dark side; even saints acknowledge actions over intentions.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows are all about intentions, so the public is generally more forgiving of guests’ performances as long as they are interesting and engaging! Even in instinctive films, Xu Zhu was criticized not for her selfish nature but for her inability to secure a role and almost derailing the plot by causing a key character's death. She wasn’t condemned to leave the entertainment industry just because of her inherent flaws.
 

 
Tong Zhao's princess syndrome was similarly accepted.
 

 
Of course, some people disliked it, but others found it endearing.
 

 
Anyway, the audience wasn’t the ones being used as tools!
 

 
There were also male viewers willing to be the tool for the beautiful sister.
 

 
And some people even felt vicariously pleased.
 

 
The variety of opinions played out on the screen.
 

 
Before the next gathering, Zhong Muxi indeed proposed joining in on the preparation work, and Han Zhi gladly agreed.
 

 
He also slowly built rapport with Zhong Muxi in his own way—
 

 
Zhong Muxi was like a shy little hedgehog, even more so than Chang Xiaonian, requiring patience.
 

 
He had to take it slow, being a patient hunter.
# Chapter47
The afternoon sunlight gently bathed the grass.
 

 
The well-trimmed lawn was gilded with a layer of gold, beautiful like an oil painting. And Tong Zhao, wearing a straw hat and well-applied sunscreen, was the main character of this oil painting. She was also very aware of her role, and after tasting each of the hot dishes, salads, and desserts her friend had prepared, she began to give her feedback:
 

 
“This sweet and sour spareribs and potato-braised beef brisket are quite good, though the spareribs could be a bit sweeter.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian coolly remarked, “If you want it sweeter, you can make it yourself.”
 

 
“But mine doesn’t taste as good as Muxi’s,” Tong Zhao said, speaking very kindly to the well-trained butler number two, Zhong Muxi. With a soft voice and clasped hands, she pleaded, “Muxi’s cooking is the best. My hands hurt, so I can't hold the pot, and I’ve never learned to cook. Thankfully, you’re here. I wouldn’t know what to do without you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Your hands hurting my foot!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian felt sick just looking at her.
 

 
But with such a pleasant attitude and flattery in every sentence, Zhong Muxi, who had a thin skin, blushed with embarrassment and looked quite pleased. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t say anything more and had to console herself – at least Tong Zhao knew not to be pushy about getting a free ride.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was still naïve.
 

 
When the relationship became truly familiar, the imperial consort could show off with an air of authority.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The training of a butler is subtle and imperceptible, like a silent influence.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [At first, they just prepared my portion and received compliments. Then, they were asked to make dishes according to my preferences, and now they know my tastes without me saying anything... Not bad!]
 

 
[I suddenly understand how my cat pua-ed me.]
 

 
[This litter-scooping officer is crying.]
 

 
[Congratulations to Miss Muxi for getting a cat master!]
 

 
[The only sane and normal person on the scene might be Miss Chang…]
 

 
Blushing from the compliments, Zhong Muxi hurriedly lowered her head and said quietly, “If you like it, I’ll add more sugar next time.”
 

 
Humans are social animals.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not a cold and solitary type. After being abandoned by a man and resisting male company, she craved a sense of security in friendships more than most girls. The pain of being dumped largely comes from being rejected and betrayed by those closest to you, with original hopes and plans torn up and thrown away, leaving the abandoned party helplessly facing memories.
 

 
Tong Zhao provided her with generous and affirming recognition.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian watched her and felt silently sick.
 

 
“Ah, I’m done drinking.” After finishing the last sip of mango juice, Tong Zhao looked dejected.
 

 
“Would you like more mango juice, or should we try something else?”
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi had made many freshly squeezed fruit juices and put them in the fridge.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m getting a bit tired of mango juice; I want watermelon juice.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took the empty cup to the kitchen to rinse it and set it aside to dry. Then, she took out the watermelon juice from the fridge and, the moment she placed it in front of Tong Zhao, it felt like a jolt in her brain — [Oh no, what am I doing!!!]
 

 
[I can’t be complicit in this!!]
 

 
[Why am I listening to her??? Does she have no hands or feet???]
 

 
“Thank you.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the watermelon juice with both hands and smiled sweetly at her.
 

 
……
 

 
To be honest, Chang Xiaonian was straightforward and only liked men.
 

 
She liked reading romance novels and watching idol dramas.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was cold towards them, Chang Xiaonian had a negative impression of her.
 

 
However, when Tong Zhao used her tactics for dealing with men to charm and act cute with her —
 

 
The inner voice couldn’t lie: [It’s so annoying. Why does someone have to be so cute when they smile?]
 

 
[……I retract my statement about Miss Chang being the only sane person.]
 

 
[Why hate on "green tea"? It's because the "green tea" isn’t aimed at you. /doge]
 

 
Chang Xiaonian sat down with a wooden expression, struggling to accept her own behavior of switching sides.
 

 
It must have just been a momentary lapse; it doesn’t mean anything…!
 

 
※
 

 
It seemed Zhong Muxi's emotional state had been improving day by day.
 

 
The injuries on her hands had decreased but left varying shades of scars, so she only wore long-sleeved clothes to hide them, even wearing a dark-colored coat when swimming. When alone, she often stared at the wounds on her hands and regretted self-harm.
 

 
Some comments criticized her for not taking care of herself.
 

 
Others showed understanding.
 

 
As an amateur, Zhong Muxi’s solo clips had very few views.
 

 
After all, her life wasn’t very interesting; the only highlight was her interactions with Han Zhi. Han Zhi's fans might as well watch his solo clips instead.
 

 
However, the popular comments under Zhong Muxi’s solo clips received a lot of approval:
 

 
[This is what heartbreak is like. You come to terms with it yesterday, but today you can’t handle it. When you’ve accepted it, you’re as regretful and angry with yourself as you are now. But when overwhelmed by emotions, even breathing feels like a luxury. Even if you no longer love that man, you can’t face the fact that you weren’t chosen.]
 

 
NetEase Cloud has been mocked as "Net Depression Cloud," marking the onset of depression.
 

 
Yet, the large amount of breakup literature and melancholic captions on Douyin proves that there is a corresponding market demand.
 

 
The production team of "Sea King Killer" noticed this and edited some segments of Zhong Muxi with sad background music, promoting them on many marketing accounts and Douyin influencers. This helped the variety show gain more fans. Since other guests continued to show kindness towards her, it healed many viewers, and this positive sentiment also extended to the other guests.
 

 
Except for He Shun, everyone benefited.
 

 
"Romantic Reality Show with Both Drama and Warmth: 'Sea King Killer'"
 

 
"If I had these friends during my breakup, I wouldn’t have collapsed every night."
 

 
"Collapse later; first, make Tong Zhao a plate of sweet and sour ribs.”
 

 
The last post is from a short video:
 

 
Zhong Muxi had insomnia and subconsciously went to the kitchen to harm herself, but she ran into Tong Zhao, who was out for a walk. Tong Zhao ordered her to make a late-night snack — cooking in the middle of the night, with oil smoke everywhere, who would want to do that? However, her attitude was so casual, and Zhong Muxi was in a particularly vulnerable state, so she really put down the fruit knife and made the snack…
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t finish it alone, so she pulled Zhong Muxi to sit down and ate a big bowl of rice with sweet and sour ribs.
 

 
The carbs were overwhelming.
 

 
Zhong Muxi ended up with a full belly, dazedly being escorted back to her room.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian was awakened by the noise, she was still half-asleep. Tong Zhao's meaningful comment, “Take care of your friend,” startled her awake. She quickly pulled Zhong Muxi to wash her face, brush her teeth, and get into bed, making sure to tuck in the corners of the blanket securely before feeling at ease.
 

 
Only the omniscient viewers knew that Tong Zhao was truly a light sleeper.
 

 
Since the little dog incident, she had even moved the sofa to behind the door, sleeping directly behind the door to not miss any noise, determined to catch that dog. The audience was charmed by her relentless spirit, crowning her as the 999th generation leader of the Beggar’s Sect, mastering the art of dog-beating.
 

 
Unfortunately, the little dog never appeared.
 

 
Tong Zhao was increasingly frustrated and more determined.
 

 
In the manor with six people, the five who were grouped together made the one left out feel even worse.
 

 
Previously, He Shun was distant from others, believing he was above them and unable to relate to women and children. It was his choice. But now, others ignored him; even when their eyes met in passing, they would immediately look away. This feeling…
 

 
Was utterly terrible!
 

 
He had exposed Tong Zhao’s true nature under the public eye.
 

 
He didn’t expect that not only was she not ostracized, but her relationships with others also improved — Tong Zhao had previously relied only on him. Observing silently, his mentality began to collapse. He Shun couldn’t accept that he was a failure, a loser in this game. He had not only lost in love but also lost the respect of others.
 

 
And all of this was thanks to Tong Zhao.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t understand more and more, and he really wanted to find someone to voice his grievances.
 

 
Men wouldn’t understand; they were all Tong Zhao’s sycophants.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was too blunt to empathize with a man’s difficulties.
 

 
That left Zhong Muxi, who was weak and easy to talk to.
 

 
His thoughts were laid bare under the AI scan, and they deeply disgusted the audience.
 

 
[Picking on the weak and fearing the strong, what a real man / like/like]
 

 
[Get lost. What kind of ability is it to target the soft Zhong Muxi? If you have guts, go after Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s sarcasm is at MAX level. If he gets another round, he might never recover / doge]
 

 
Unfortunately, the audience couldn’t influence the development of the show and could only vent their frustration through comments and bullet screens. What’s worse, this episode ended with He Shun’s dark and irritable inner thoughts —
 

 
[I’m an adult; I don’t need you to prevent me from getting obsessed. I want to be obsessed!]
 

 
But it was useless. No matter how anxious he was, he had to wait for the next episode to air.
 

 
Zhong Muxi rarely had moments alone, but He Shun had too much free time. Plus, the production team deliberately arranged for them to meet — this dirty scheme was definitely kept confidential and would also increase monitoring on He Shun. If any signs of violent behavior were detected, he would be forcibly awakened before his brain could issue commands to his hands, and expelled from the holographic space.
 

 
While the variety show encouraged conflict for gimmicks, there were strict personal safety regulations to avoid leaving psychological scars on the actors and guests.
 

 
Anyway, on this morning when Zhong Muxi got up particularly early to make porridge for her friend, He Shun cornered her in the kitchen.
 

 
"Miss Zhong, I want to talk to you."
 

 
He Shun walked up to her.
 

 
Mr. He, who usually paid great attention to his personal image and dressed immaculately, now appeared tired. Underneath his typically resolute and refined face, there was a faint bluish tint, a sign of unkempt stubble. Zhong Muxi flinched slightly: "Is there something wrong? I'm cooking..."
 

 
"Listen to me first."
 

 
He Shun interrupted her, ignoring her fearful body language: "I remember that when you first arrived at the manor, you said you didn’t know how to cook. Why did you lie to me?"
 

 
He knew exactly how to bully people.
 

 
By pointing out the other party’s moral flaws, he made Zhong Muxi, who was prone to self-blame, feel disadvantaged in the conversation.
 

 
"At that time... I didn’t want to cook." Zhong Muxi clenched her fingers tightly.
 

 
"Fine, I won’t hold you accountable for lying," He Shun pretended to be magnanimous, “But isn’t it excessive how you all exclude me from everything? I was clearly deceived and hurt... I heard you’ve been through a breakup too. Why can’t you understand my feelings? By siding with Tong Zhao, you’re an accomplice."
 

 
Caught off guard by the reopened wound, Zhong Muxi looked at him in shock.
 

 
She shook her head, tears welling up in her throat.
 

 
The audience was on the verge of a brain hemorrhage, with some irate ones calling her a pushover, but more were anxiously calling for the show’s director.
 

 
From her reaction, He Shun regained his confidence.
 

 
Although his appearance was plain, this woman did have some merits.
 

 
At least she didn’t ridicule him mercilessly like the other two women.
 

 
He continued his reasoning: "Don’t deny it, and don’t say it’s Tong Zhao who doesn’t welcome me. Half a month has passed, have you ever thought about suggesting to them to invite me along? No, in the face of passive aggression, silence and watching are complicity. I really... didn’t expect you to be this kind of person. Or did you simply not realize it? Men care about details too. My breakup was due to malicious deceit, maybe you’re just too cold and numb."
 

 
Mr. He was particularly resentful.
 

 
Already feeling wronged, he was further ostracized.
 

 
"I didn’t, I didn’t know. Don’t talk to me about this. I don’t want to talk to you…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi usually had strong logical reasoning, but being abandoned was her sore spot. The moment the pain point was touched, her eyes welled up with tears, and she could only shake her head and deny it while trying to hold back the tears. She turned to escape, but he, being perceptive, stopped her in time. This time, he wasn’t angry at all and managed to control himself to avoid any physical contact—Mr. He disliked violence, considering it a barbaric and uncivilized act. The last time was purely a misunderstanding, and Tong Zhao was just too infuriating.
 

 
“Stop avoiding this—”
 

 
Before He Shun could finish his stern speech, he received a kick to his side.
 

 
The kick was swift and fierce, causing his body to tilt sideways and stumble several steps before he managed to steady himself.
 

 
It was technically an act of violence, but the production team deemed it self-defense as long as the kicker didn’t continue to assault him, it wouldn’t cross the line.
 

 
Clearly, Tong Zhao had no interest in continuing to beat him.
 

 
Her strength was limited, and she might even risk injuring herself without making a tough-skinned man feel much pain.
 

 
Tong Zhao was delicate—she could mock and insult, or incite others to fight, but personally taking action? A dog like him didn’t deserve it.
 

 
With a raised chin, Tong Zhao locked eyes with the astonished He Shun. She curled her lips into a smirk, her tone slow and firm, carrying an air of pride and condescension: “Bullying a woman you can’t defeat, so you go after weaker women? Very well, you’ve learned something.”
 

 
“You—”
 

 
“Shut up, did I give you permission to speak?!”
 

 
With the smile gone, Tong Zhao’s expression turned cold. Still dressed in her immaculate white dress, her imposing aura left He Shun speechless.
 

 
“You don’t need to ask her. I just dislike you. You annoy me. You’re not allowed at any gatherings, and if you have any objections, come to me directly. Don’t whine to others…”
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly tilted her chin towards Zhong Muxi, indicating for her to stay behind her.
 

 
She followed Tong Zhao closely like a dog that had found its owner.
 

 
“First, it shows you’re picking on the weak and fearing the strong.”
 

 
“Second, it’s useless to confront them. I’m the one with the decision-making power. Understand? They don’t matter.”
 

 
Deserving of both praise and criticism, Empress Chen never liked using her subordinates as shields.
 

 
However, she didn’t consider this as protection.
 

 
She only believed in evaluating dogs based on their owners.
 

 
He Shun’s action of bypassing her to cause trouble for Zhong Muxi completely crossed her boundaries, making her feel deeply embarrassed. She had to regain her dignity and vent her frustration with a harsh rebuke.
 

 
“And also, you were criticizing the reason for their breakup? According to your logic, the one who dumps can evaluate the one who’s dumped. Fine, listen carefully,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, with Zhong Muxi tightly holding her arm, briefly frowned but tolerated the action as if it were a gift. She channeled her slight irritation onto Mr. He, scrutinizing him from head to toe with her bright apricot eyes, and then shook her head.
 

 
While Zhong Muxi’s head shake made him feel powerful, Tong Zhao’s shake of the head made him feel defeated and humiliated, as if he were being treated like a fool:
 

 
“I rejected your confession because I look down on you, loathe you from head to toe, and find you annoying. If anyone can kneel and perform a kiss-hand gesture for me, you’re not even worthy to lick my shoes while lying on the ground.”
 

 
She was both arrogant and delighted, genuinely happy to demean her enemy.
 

 
He Shun was stunned by the insult.
 

 
The audience was also impressed by Tong Zhao’s spontaneous, flowing arrogance.
 

 
[One person desperately asks Tong Zhao to start a teaching class!!!]
 

 
[Tears, why can’t I insult people as effectively as she does?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is not just green tea; she’s a fighter jet in the red tea realm, maybe Keemun black tea... People who argue with such confidence are unbeatable. It’s a skill you can’t learn.]
 

 
There were also some off-topic comments.
 

 
Curious passersby wondered how Tong Zhao's fans must be, given how effectively she could curse. Her fans shook their heads and waved their hands, clarifying that it wasn't true. Since her debut, she had always been friendly and had never caused conflicts with others. In fact, there was almost a confrontation with Han Zhi’s fans, but as it turned out, they were all one big family, so it ended up being resolved.
 

 
Tong Zhao had no intention of staying to argue with him.
 

 
Did he deserve it?
 

 
She said everything she wanted to say and felt relieved. She didn't care how others felt; she was a woman who took arrogance to the extreme. Turning off the stove, she led Zhong Muxi out of the kitchen and upstairs. Zhong Muxi hesitated and said, “You mentioned last night that you wanted to have conpoy porridge…”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[……So it was your doing, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
[No wonder she appeared so timely; she was here to supervise, hahaha……]
 

 
“Wait, I’ll let Han Zhi make it. The kitchen is too unlucky right now, and living people shouldn’t enter.” Recently, she had picked up some jargon from playing with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Zhong Muxi whispered, “Is Brother Zhi a ghost?”
 

 
“Hmm, he’s quite ghostly.”
 

 
Han Zhi's reputation suffered.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t stand it any longer and applied to leave the event early.
 

 
After receiving approval from the production team and a vote from VIP viewers, He Shun was removed from the holographic space.
 

 
What awaited him was the sympathetic gaze of the production staff…
 

 
He Shun smiled politely, “Thank you for your hard work. I have a bit of a headache, so I’ll go rest for a while.” He decided to wait until his memory recovered to see the show’s replay and understand why others looked at him strangely.
 

 
And now, back to the reality show.
 

 
Upon arriving on the second floor, Zhong Muxi thanked Tong Zhao, her voice full of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao wondered, ‘Should I be comforting her right now?’
 

 
‘I can’t do that. I only know how to curse, mock…… and act spoiled……’
 

 
The noble lady was troubled.
 

 
Soon, her tiny bit of conscience and sympathy was depleted by her thinking, and she accepted Zhong Muxi’s thanks with composure, saying, “If you’re grateful, I want tea-marinated chicken wings and squirrel-shaped mandarin fish for dinner.”
 

 
“Okay, I’ll make them all for you.”
 

 
Preparing the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish is quite troublesome in home cooking—it requires deboning the fish, scoring it, and deep-frying it.
 

 
Viewers were excited to witness the birth of the first tool.
 

 
[Comforting people? Tong Zhao doesn’t know how. Just order some food for the cleaning staff.]
 

 
[Learned the art of ordering food as comfort.]
 

 
[I also want to be protected by a little kitty, sob sob sob……]
 

 
Tong Zhao was satisfied.
 

 
After Zhong Muxi calmed down, she couldn’t hold back her tears and quietly cried while holding onto Tong Zhao’s sleeve, making her a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
So, leading the crying and indecisive Zhong Muxi, Tong Zhao knocked on Han Zhi’s door. When he came out in slippers, she pushed her inside and briefly explained the situation: “I’m going to take a nap. I hope to have conpoy porridge by eleven.”
 

 
[It’s time for my favorite segment where Tong Zhao orders food!]
 

 
This comment was highlighted and bolded by other users.
 

 
After saying this, Tong Zhao simply left.
 

 
She believed that Han Zhi wouldn’t do something as low as taking advantage of a vulnerable girl; it was beneath his standards. Even if pressured, he likely wouldn’t act that way. When she woke up right on time at eleven, Zhong Muxi was already at the door with steaming conpoy porridge.
 

 
The viewers on the barrage had reached a level of frustration so high that they lost the will to express it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, how many caretakers' lives have you ruined!
 

 
By evening, everyone received an official notice—player He Shun had decided to withdraw from the game due to personal reasons. His previous selections would be retained, but other players could no longer choose him as their object of affection.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian spat, “Even if he were the only man left in the world, I wouldn’t choose him.”
 

 
“Well said.”
 

 
Tong Zhao happily enjoyed the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish made specially for her.
 

 
Seeing her savoring it, Chang Xiaonian also tried a bit: “It’s so sweet. How did you make it so sweet?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi quickly looked away after glancing at Tong Zhao with embarrassment.
 

 
Tong Zhao loved sweets and preferred a sweeter approach even for hot dishes.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian immediately understood: “...Xiao Xi, you just indulge her!”
 

 
The laughter and chatter around the dinner table temporarily lifted the gloom from her heart.
 

 
However, as night fell and everything grew silent, Zhong Muxi still couldn’t sleep, thinking about what Mr. He had said to her. She couldn’t control herself from recalling that failed relationship; someone she genuinely liked didn’t even give her a proper closure and left her impatiently.
 

 
She didn’t cry or make a fuss during the breakup; letting go wasn’t difficult.
 

 
What was difficult was the endless questioning of why he wasn’t willing to stay.
 

 
Each time, she felt that she was inadequate—otherwise, why couldn’t she keep the person closest to her? Reflecting on every painful detail, she wondered if noticing and doing better at that moment might have salvaged the relationship.
 

 
...
 

 
Unconsciously, Zhong Muxi found herself moving like a zombie, getting out of bed and stepping into the hallway.
 

 
She stood there, crying for a while, overwhelmed by negative emotions again.
 

 
Tonight, there are two people unable to rest peacefully.
 

 
One is Han Zhi.
 

 
The other is Wei Zekai.
 

 
When Han Zhi opened his door and didn’t see anyone in the hallway, he went downstairs. Wei Zekai, moving even more slowly, hesitated repeatedly, thinking about that tearful face, which then turned into the image of a small dog.
 

 
Another person who stays up particularly late and has light sleep is Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t worried about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
She was here to catch the dog.
 

 
Feeling burdened with the responsibility of being a righteous avenger, Wei Zekai, the dog, encountered Tong Zhao, who was holding a blanket and acting as the dog-catching team leader, once again in the hallway.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [......]
# Chapter48
When two paths cross, the brave win.
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai the corgi had many thoughts running through his mind—
 

 
For instance, he imagined a distinctive "danger" character from *Sekiro* appearing above his head.
 

 
For instance, wasn’t this his comrade?
 

 
For instance, why was Tong Zhao coming out at this time?
 

 
His view of Tong Zhao was mixed, combining two perspectives, and was quite complicated.
 

 
Tong Zhao's view of him, however, was much simpler.
 

 
She was determined to catch this dog!
 

 
After removing the bedding, she had only a thin sheet left. She threw the blanket, which fell over the small dog, enveloping him. Catching a dog by hand was too difficult and might give the dog a chance to escape. Tong Zhao never overestimated her physical abilities. Once the blanket covered the little dog, she quickly gathered it up and packed it to bring back to her room.
 

 
[Caught!]
 

 
[Lol, this combination is so offbeat.]
 

 
[The heartbreaker turned dog-catching team leader, Wei Zekai gets the first prize, add a chicken leg!]
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog really wasn’t interested in any damn chicken legs.
 

 
The blanket was making him a bit uncomfortable. Normally, a regular dog would use its claws to get out, but he was afraid of hurting Tong Zhao. So, he kept his claws sheathed and gave some symbolic angry kicks. After a couple of kicks, he found the spot where his paws were stepping felt a bit soft... Damn it!
 

 
Wei Zekai became somewhat guilty and quieted down.
 

 
[It's not like I did it on purpose, why should I feel guilty about it!]
 

 
[Forget it, I’m just afraid of hurting her if I push too hard.]
 

 
[By the way, wasn’t her right hand injured? How come she’s grabbing me so forcefully? Damn it!]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s furious barking was heard clearly by the audience with the God’s-eye view.
 

 
Usually, cursing on a variety show would lead to losing fans.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s ineffectual, furious barking actually hit the audience’s cute and funny points, making them think the little master was so adorable he should debut directly, more likable than many celebrities' true selves.
 

 
One comment that was highlighted and praised even expressed the audience’s shared sentiment:
 

 
[So, among the six people, only Wei Zekai truly believes Tong Zhao’s hand is still injured? /candle/ candle]
 

 
The general audience found him cute, but for the Wei family and those who knew both of them in real life...
 

 
Sigh, it's painful to watch.
 

 
When Wei Zekai finally escaped from the blanket trap, he first saw an enlarged female face.
 

 
Tong Zhao only had a bedside lamp on.
 

 
The warm yellow light from the side illuminated her already beautiful face, making it appear even more gentle. The director’s casual close-up shots were of cinematic quality, and screenshots of her holding the little dog were even used by netizens for promotions—so beautifully shot that the unauthorized use of this image frequently appeared on pet bloggers' and animal protection public accounts, becoming an unexpected viral sensation.
 

 
Everyone noticed Tong Zhao’s beauty.
 

 
Except the dog.
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog: [...Caught by her again!]
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog: [What’s her problem? Why is she so fixated on me? I’m supposed to be judging sea kings and saving true love!]
 

 
The little dog barked fiercely at her, warning her to let him go.
 

 
Tong Zhao remained unfazed.
 

 
She thought that Wei Zekai would definitely panic when he realized the dog was missing. If she confronted him with the dog tomorrow, maybe she could extract some information and use the opportunity to close the emotional gap. There was no other way; this little master was too difficult to crack, so she had to use unconventional methods.
 

 
As for the dog...
 

 
Tong Zhao really didn’t plan to do anything to it; she would just take good care of it for the night.
 

 
However, after it barked at her, she narrowed her eyes slightly.
 

 
Even without being familiar with “A Hundred Ways to Gaze in Romance Novels,” one could sense the danger from her slightly narrowed eyes.
 

 
The Empress Dowager loathed being provoked.
 

 
She only let the dog’s head stick out from the blanket, leaving the rest of the short dog body still wrapped up like a spring roll, ensuring the dog couldn’t run around.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can’t just take out my anger on the dog.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, the barking dog’s blame will be placed on Wei Zekai. I’ll settle it with him sooner or later.]
 

 
Having exercised some energy while catching the dog, Tong Zhao found herself unable to sleep. Feeling bored, she started playing with the dog. She had always suspected that Wei Zekai might be the judge, so perhaps this official-spy dog might have some hidden mechanisms?
 

 
With this thought in mind, Tong Zhao slipped her hand into the spring roll-like blanket, trying to search the little dog for possible cameras, recorders, or GPS devices.
 

 
At first, the dog didn’t understand what she was trying to do.
 

 
Until its sensitive, snow-white belly was rubbed by her hand.
 

 
[What... the hell!]
 

 
Tong Zhao had a basic affection for small animals. Her touch was firm yet gentle, careful not to hurt it. But this gentle petting was so ticklish that the corgi started yelping loudly. Afraid of attracting others to witness its embarrassed state, the originally robust barking turned into a soft, plaintive protest.
 

 
It sounded a lot like whining.
 

 
The audience was also stunned.
 

 
[Is this content allowed? It actually seems like it is.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai seems to have started enjoying it after barking a couple of times, hahahaha…]
 

 
[If the goddess pets me like that, I could also become a dog. Woof woof!]
 

 
The mainstream sentiment on the screen became a flood of woofs.
 

 
Everyone wanted to become a little pet of their idol.
 

 
Not finding what she had imagined on the little corgi, Tong Zhao reluctantly withdrew her hand.
 

 
And Wei Zekai had already turned into a useless dog that couldn’t even wag its tiny tail, with a blank mind: [Huff… Huff… Damn woman, why am I so ticklish? It’s driving me crazy!]
 

 
Those who are ticklish know that after being thoroughly tickled, their mental defenses are at their weakest.
 

 
It’s akin to a sage’s time.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao slowly threw out a question: “Little puppy… or should I call you Wei Zekai?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: [……]
 

 
Her tone was very certain.
 

 
Her inner thoughts were casual:
 

 
[Not finding anything, and now can’t sleep, let’s play with the dog for a bit and then sleep.]
 

 
This headless question was a byproduct of her insomnia and playing with the dog.
 

 
But Wei Zekai didn’t know she was such a bored person and was stunned.
 

 
The dog, originally looking angry, now seemed a bit cute as it stared blankly at itself. Tong Zhao, while patting its chin, continued with a smile: “Do you think you’re doing a good job acting? Actually, I saw through it long ago. Some of your small movements are common in dogs.”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao, whose interest came and went quickly, soon lost interest.
 

 
She unwrapped the blanket and planned to drive the little corgi to the bathroom, so it could make do with sleeping there for the night and avoid messing up the room: “I’m going to uncover the blanket for you now. You’d better turn back and explain things to me…”
 

 
Just as her words ended, a puff of unknown smoke with cartoon sound effects erupted on the bed.
 

 
Moments later, the smoke cleared.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “……”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “……I can explain.”
 

 
Underneath the brown-gold highlighted hair was a face of shock and embarrassment.
 

 
Suddenly appearing face-to-face, Tong Zhao’s internal thoughts raced at a speed that even advanced AI couldn't keep up with. After a rapid, almost unbelievable internal monologue, she quickly accepted this supernatural scenario and identified the most advantageous course for herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao reached out, grabbed his collar, and pulled him towards her.
 

 
Compared to Tong Zhao’s rapid internal dialogue, Wei Zekai's brain was blank. Caught off guard by her sudden pull, he stumbled forward. Fortunately, his physical reaction speed was good enough to single-handedly catch the blanket just in time…
 

 
At this moment, his and Tong Zhao’s lips were only a fingertip apart.
 

 
In the next moment, Wei Zekai scrambled to the foot of the bed, his back hitting the wall without him realizing it.
 

 
[What a waste, what a waste!]
 

 
[Wei Zekai probably thinks his reaction speed is amazing right now!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, still shaken: [Damn, I managed to avoid kissing even in that situation. I’m so awesome.]
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Laughing so hard, what’s the benefit for you? Hahaha!]
 

 
Tong Zhao clearly hadn’t expected this outcome either.
 

 
She wasn’t planning to force a kiss; she just wanted to close the distance to talk.
 

 
Even if he hadn’t managed to catch the mattress in time, she would have simply stopped his shoulder. But she never imagined he would perform such an evasive maneuver.
 

 
The two of them stared at each other in astonishment for a moment.
 

 
The romantic fantasies from love movies had vanished entirely.
 

 
The top-notch love movie heroine, the Empress, had been unexpectedly turned into a comedian.
 

 
Even Tong Zhao was momentarily at a loss for what to do.
 

 
While she was considering which tactic to switch to, Wei Zekai reacted first. His handsome face turned bright red in an instant: “W-Why did you pull me like that? You almost caused a big problem!”
 

 
The child was so frightened that he could barely articulate his words.
 

 
Wei Zekai had never been so close to a girl in his life.
 

 
Back in school, he liked to perm his hair, dye it, and get tattoos. To his classmates, he was seen as a wealthy, high-class troublemaker, and female classmates didn’t dare to talk to him. The young ladies of similar social status thought he was eccentric. Only Tong Zhao could handle his nonsensical and sharp-tongued remarks... even then, their interactions never crossed boundaries.
 

 
In the reality show, Tong Zhao was a girl he had only known for a little over half a month.
 

 
Initially, he didn’t take her seriously, and later, it was just a pure and steadfast friendship.
 

 
In the moment when he almost kissed her, Wei Zekai’s gender awareness, which had been misplaced in his brain somewhere, finally returned to its correct position. He realized that his battle comrade was a soft girl... indeed very soft... if her whole body is that soft, her lips must be soft too...
 

 
[Stop!]
 

 
[No more reminiscing!]
 

 
Wei Zekai was startled by his own thoughts.
 

 
His shyness and diminished confidence only added to his discomfort: “I didn’t choose to become a dog, and I didn’t intend to be caught...”
 

 
From an observer’s perspective, Wei Zekai was in the right.
 

 
He had turned into a dog, but he wasn’t chasing Tong Zhao; he was just innocently passing by in the hallway.
 

 
However, what kind of person is Tong Zhao? Even if Wei Zekai explained things clearly, her quick wit could come up with twisted reasoning to confuse him—she was like a keen predator, never missing any flaw.
 

 
The more he retreated, the more she pressed on.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow slightly and leaned forward. This time, Wei Zekai had nowhere left to retreat:
 

 
"Because I'm very interested in you, little doggy."
 

 
Her usually cheerful and somewhat arrogant voice was now subdued and heavy. The light from the bedside lamp cast a halo around her, outlining her graceful figure under her nightwear. In this moment of gender reversal, the scene stirred the audience's hearts with excitement, yet retained a subtle purity. The more they knew that nothing serious would happen, the more they looked forward to the development.
 

 
"Inter-interested!?"
 

 
Wei Zekai stuttered.
 

 
……
 

 
The production team was also quite intrigued at this moment.
 

 
A mischievous writer then suggested, "Why not let Wei Zekai keep his biggest appeal point?"
 

 
"What appeal point?" The director scratched his face.
 

 
"The dog ears and tail. Don’t people always want to pet him?"
 

 
Everyone agreed that this was a good idea.
 

 
The director glanced at the modeler, who confirmed that adding these features was a simple task and could be done immediately if approved. The director nodded enthusiastically, "Add them. Let the audience see this particularly honest tail."
 

 
As the audience was engrossed, an official announcement with a white background and black text popped up from above:
 

 
"Staff have decided to return some of the dog features to the Judge.”
 

 
"Hope the Judge can turn the tables with the cheats we've given him!"
 

 
Just as the comment flew by, there was a *Duang* sound, and stuttering Wei Zekai's head and rear each sprouted dog ears and a little tail.
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted this supernatural development with composure.
 

 
Her focus was solely on the prize money; as long as he didn’t turn into a cockroach, she could accept anything!
 

 
"Yes, I'm very interested in you,"
 

 
Tong Zhao pushed him against the wall. Wei Zekai, irritated, desperately pressed his ears and tail, wanting to either push them back or rip them off. However, when he tried to pull them with force, it hurt so much that his eyes turned red. His anxious and pitiful appearance stirred a hidden sadistic side in Tong Zhao. She firmly grabbed his wrist, "Stop pulling, doesn't it hurt?"
 

 
"It hurts!" Wei Zekai was furious: "This is the ability given by the officials. It was supposed to be just turning into a dog for an hour, with the option to change back at any time. Damn it, what’s with these dog ears and tail? What the hell..."
 

 
His panic even made his dialect accent pop out.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but smile and gently stroked his dog ears.
 

 
The moment she touched them, the dog ears perked up.
 

 
Wei Zekai, panicked, slapped her hand away: "Don’t touch!"
 

 
He hadn’t felt it when he was pulling them himself, but when someone else touched them—especially Tong Zhao’s cool, soft little hand—it made his nerves tingle and his whole body felt off. He had slapped a bit too hard and, realizing his mistake, his eyes showed a large amount of regret as he held her hand: "I didn’t notice earlier. Damn it, your hand was already injured… I’m sorry, my mistake."
 

 
His face was visibly remorseful.
 

 
[Poor Wei Zekai, fooled completely by the wicked woman.]
 

 
[To this day, he still believes Tong Zhao's hand is injured! Wake up!]
 

 
[He might be the type who still believes in Santa Claus as an adult.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was as stunned as the audience.
 

 
However, after hearing his self-explosion, she was even more certain of his role as the Judge and knew she needed to be more careful in her approach…
 

 
【Wei Zekai's personality is a bit off-track; you can’t use typical strategies to deal with him.】
 

 
【Playing subtlety with him either means he understands it as 'we’re really close' or, by the end of the month, he still won’t grasp my subtext. It’s useless; the subtext needs to be submerged so deep it’s at the bottom of the ocean.】
 

 
Tong Zhao's inner thoughts precisely analyzed Wei Zekai's personality.
 

 
So, she decided to go for a direct approach.
 

 
“By 'interested,' I mean I like you,”
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out her phone, turning her back to Wei Zekai as she clicked through to open the photo album.
 

 
In the album were three screenshots of the "Heartfelt" app’s interface, edited for effect.
 

 
The only difference between the three screenshots was the name selected on the app:
 

 
“You are my Heartfelt Choice.”
 

 
After a pause, amidst the audience's barrage of question marks and exclamation points and the anxious silence from Wei Zekai holding his breath, she spoke the crucial line in a firm, gentle, and earnest tone, flipping her phone to show him the screen—her carefully prepared ace!
 

 
The "Sea King Kill" battle tested emotional intelligence and, even more, intellectual prowess.
 

 
……
 

 
[Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, who can compete with her?]
 

 
[Is there a cut of this scene in Tong Zhao’s individual segment? How did Sherlock Holmes miss this clue?]
 

 
[I’m crying; my baby is being deceived by the wicked woman.]
 

 
At this moment, the audience was ecstatic over the "wicked woman."
 

 
This was precisely the kind of intellectual and courageous showdown they had hoped to see in "Sea King Kill." Tong Zhao, who remained clear-headed until the final moment, was indeed incredibly impressive… Of course, she was also very cool and fierce in "Countdown 72 Hours," with action scenes that made hearts race and legs go weak.
 

 
However, the literary scenes in "Sea King Kill" delighted the brainy audience, like taking a big bite of cake only to find it filled with fresh, surprising fruit.
 

 
This woman was a master strategist.
 

 
With "Sea King Kill" still ongoing, various variety shows and film invitations, like snowflakes, were flying into the hands of her manager, Sister Chu.
 

 
Who wouldn’t want the subconscious effects of such a show?
 

 
The one that intrigued Sister Chu the most was an invitation to a fantasy martial arts film.
 

 
"Ruthless Tribulation”
 

 
She checked the information and found that it was a long-standing major production, fully prepared and ready to start, but they were struggling with choosing the lead actress. The scriptwriter had given the heroine so many challenges that there was no suitable actress to take on the role. Moreover, the scriptwriter was a prominent figure with a powerful background who refused to make changes, leaving no solution but to delay the project.
 

 
The industry had nearly forgotten about it.
 

 
“... Let’s have Tong Zhao decide.”
 

 
Back to the scene.
 

 
Wei Zekai hesitated and asked, “You like me? How is that possible?”
 

 
Once Tong Zhao confirmed that Wei Zekai had seen the content, she pressed the lock screen button and set her phone aside.
 

 
“How is it not possible?” she asked, curious about his reasoning.
 

 
He nodded solemnly:
 

 
“Well, liking me is quite reasonable. After all, I have so many advantages. I always found it strange that no one confessed their feelings to me before. It seems the world has finally returned to normal.” Wei Zekai sighed in relief, as he had indeed been puzzled by the lack of confessions in the past! The world had been out of order.
 

 
“...”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I really want to hit him.]
 

 
However, his smugly wagging little tail was somewhat endearing.
 

 
Tong Zhao graciously forgave him and continued the scene: “So, do you have any feelings for me?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had two thoughts: [1. To seduce Wei Zekai and actually make him like her.] [2. If that doesn’t work, Plan B is to let him say he doesn’t like her, and she’ll just leave him alone, but at least she wants to pair up on the Heartfelt app. Given his personality, the chances of him agreeing are quite high.]
 

 
The ruthless and merciless woman had only one goal in mind: to complete this game.
 

 
“Huh? Feelings?”
 

 
Wei Zekai’s brain was overheating.
 

 
He was originally holding Tong Zhao’s hand to check for injuries, but she took the opportunity to interlock their fingers and put on an expression of focused anticipation: “I played so many games with you, and you don’t have any feelings for me?”
 

 
Realizing that Tong Zhao was a girl, Wei Zekai could no longer view her as he had before.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Wow, she’s kind of pretty.]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[If given another chance, would you still say it’s just a little?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, such a beautiful woman, has such a hard time being pursued. I’m starting to wonder what kind of girlfriend the real Mr. Wei would end up with.]
 

 
“I think you’re quite good,” Wei Zekai said, each word coming out slowly as if he was searching for the right expression. “Wang Er’s Diao Chan is very skilled, Orange’s Guan Yu self-destructs all the way, playing an ADC in the bottom lane against two opponents, and the support is also great at engaging…”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her temples throb.
 

 
[Forget it, I didn’t expect that even Tong Zhao would resort to moral blackmail. Sigh.]
 

 
The bullet screen exploded with comments.
 

 
“... You’re also very beautiful and a good person.”
 

 
By this point, Tong Zhao was so embarrassed she almost wished she could die.
 

 
Fortunately, it was just the two of them in the room. If a third person knew she had been rejected, she’d have to shut down on the spot.
 

 
[Hahaha, didn’t see that coming! We’re watching!]
 

 
The malicious VIP viewers even took a screenshot of the current live viewer count, adding the caption, “2516434 people watching Tong Zhao get rejected,” making the audience laugh uproariously.
 

 
[You bad woman, you have your day now!]
 

 
[So satisfying. Natural blackness is indeed a cure for scheming blackness.]
 

 
Wei Zekai finally blurted out the most crucial part: “Where do you think is a good place to buy a wedding house? During the New Year, I definitely have to go back to my own home. If you miss your home, we can each go back to our own places. My family doesn’t mind; if they do, I’ll handle it. And if we have kids, if you want them, we’ll have them. If you don’t, we won’t. But it’s better to have one. My family is quite wealthy, though we don’t have a throne, we do have a lot of money to inherit. I like both boys and girls. Actually, as long as we have a living heir, it’s not a loss. Even if it’s an alien, I’d still love it.”
 

 
…
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Huh?”
 

 
After finishing that long speech, Wei Zekai regained his rhythm. After all, he shouldn't be shy in front of his girlfriend!
 

 
So he continued to outline his future plans with Tong Zhao: “I’m currently getting an allowance from my family and have some shareholder dividends. I used to spend a lot and had no money left, but I’ll save more with a girlfriend. At most, I won’t start a business, which should save about three million each quarter to support you. After the show ends, let’s go register for marriage? If you think it’s too soon, we can get engaged first. It’s up to you; I don’t mind.”
 

 
Mr. Wei’s indifference was surprisingly detailed in his planning.
 

 
Engagement, marriage, and having children—this was his maximum understanding of romantic relationships.
 

 
As Wei Zekai spoke, he looked up, smiling with a somewhat nervous grin, his dog tail wagging as fast as a fan’s blades, and his eyes bright.
 

 
His golden-brown head was just as bright.
 

 
“According to our jungle rules, if you’re with me, you’ll get all the Buffs, but you’ll also need to share the mid-lane minions with me…”
 

 
After saying this line that would enrage any mid-laner, he suddenly lowered his head and quickly pecked her lips.
 

 
[……Got it, it’s indeed soft!]
# Chapter49
[He went for it!]
 

 
[Wow, this speed is amazing! He really is the master of tricks, like Han Zhi, a master of deception!]
 

 
[Is there a VIP brother who recorded a GIF? Please, please, please QAQ]
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned, her eyes wide.
 

 
What just happened?
 

 
Did she get kissed?
 

 
So magical…
 

 
She knew how to kiss, something deeply ingrained in her consciousness.
 

 
But what just happened could hardly be called a kiss.
 

 
It was just a brush of lips, more innocent than holding hands, and Tong Zhao found it amusing as she looked at him, realizing he hadn’t thought about what to do afterward. His ears drooped, and he just sat there, pretending to be dead. Not only was his face flushed, but his eyes were also glistening, as if he had done something remarkable and great.
 

 
Wei Zekai noticed Tong Zhao's gaze, his sensitive dog ears twitching before his face did.
 

 
“What are you laughing at?” he asked, somewhat displeased, then softened his tone: “Aren’t you angry? I kissed you out of nowhere…”
 

 
Is that something to be angry about?
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s thoughts were adorably naive, awakening a dwindling conscience in Tong Zhao that she didn’t know had been buried in a corner somewhere—her goal was just to win the game, while this little dog took her confession seriously, making her feel a pang of guilt.
 

 
“I’m not angry,”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and leaned in again.
 

 
Wei Zekai froze, staring wide-eyed.
 

 
The distance between the two was very close, so close that Wei Zekai could smell the faint scent of orange shower gel on her body, "Just wanted to teach you that what happened just now isn't called kissing, little student."
 

 
"Shit! Who are you calling a little student?"
 

 
Dangerous - elementary school student- Wei Zekai exploded, and was about to argue with his new girlfriend, but before the second sentence could be said, he was kissed back by the soft lips that came up against him. Tong Zhao kissed him against the wall, her other hand was supposed to encircle his waist, but her fingertips changed their route after touching the fluffy tail, gently grabbing the tail, and after her fingers found one of the bones, she skillfully stroked it upwards.
 

 
Wei Zekai was dumbfounded.
 

 
When the tip of her tongue pried open his thin lips, he didn't react to resist even for a moment, and was easily stirred into it.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Shit, what's going on here? I can't breathe!
 

 
As if sensing his thoughts, Tong Zhao pulls back a little, and says in a soft, mute voice, "Breathe through your nose, puppy dog."
 

 
He didn't have time to say anything, he was kissed again.
 

 
Wei Zekai is not accustomed to kissing with eyes closed, Tong Zhao also did not close her eyes, pressed under the thick eyelashes, her eyes soft and deep.
 

 
How gentle her look is, how ferocious her actions are.
 
Pushing closer and closer, kissing him until he almost fainted.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Is this, is this what love is all about? It's so exciting! It's much more exciting than a video game!
 

 
[What's wrong with playing video games, Mr. Wei?]
 

 
[What kind of drama is this? I'm high!]
 

 
The audience thought Wei Zekai was an adorable gem, even when cursing, his words had a cute tone.
 

 
But how could that be possible?
 

 
After the initial shock, Wei Zekai felt a strong sense of disbelief—why should he be held down by a delicate mid-laner? After a brief moment of stiffness, he wrapped his hand around her tiny waist and the back of her head, fiercely capturing her lips and tongue, kissing her without any restraint. Her lips were soft, and the more he kissed, the more intense it became…
 

 
When Tong Zhao was in control, the atmosphere was quite romantic.
 

 
But once it was Wei Zekai's turn to take charge, Tong Zhao suddenly broke the mood: [Ah, it feels like being enthusiastically nibbled by a large dog.]
 

 
But it's a good thing.
 

 
Men, regardless of age, whether older or younger, are considered less appealing without their sharp edges; a man who isn’t dangerous or aggressive is often seen as lacking in sex appeal. Tong Zhao felt that his currently displayed wolf-like nature was a plus, though he still had a strong “dog-like” vibe.
 
She pushed away Wei Zekai, who was in the mood for kissing.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not use much force, and Wei Zekai was pushed away by her, sitting obediently and watching her.
 

 
He was good-looking and lived a refined life, going to a high-end club every week to be styled by a familiar hairdresser. The stylist didn’t just take his money; they also gave him fashion advice and groomed his eyebrows. Whenever he appeared in public, he always looked clean and handsome. Usually proud and unruly, now under the soft light, he seemed as obedient as a well-groomed puppy.
 

 
But the taste of the passionate kiss was too wonderful, and he couldn't help but lick his lips, his little fangs revealing a hint of aggression.
 

 
He's not milky, he's fierce.
 

 
Just sits a little weird.
 

 
"Cough ......" Gui Zekai averted his eyes, his tail wagged vainly: "It's late, I'll go back to my room."
 

 
His sitting posture was a bit awkward.
 

 
"Cough..." Wei Zekai shifted his gaze, his tail flicking nervously. "It's getting late, I'm going back to my room."
 

 
Tong Zhao understood immediately.
 

 
After such an intense kiss, it was completely normal to have some indescribable reactions.
 
She didn’t feel offended; she just wanted to tease him a bit: “Aren’t you going to stay and sleep together?”
 

 
[？？？？]
 

 
[Mom won’t allow it! I don’t agree!]
 

 
[I agree! Let’s skip straight to the wedding night!]
 

 
[Got it, the way to conquer a scheming heartthrob is to be a naive sweetheart.]
 

 
This invitation is so tempting ah, Wei Zekai looks at her eyes brightly full of danger, as long as he can not hold, he will gnawes not only the mouth, but the whole person will be peeled off the bones and devoured clean ......
 

 
Yet no.
 

 
"I won't!"
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, clearly pleased: “Elementary schooler, huh?”
 

 
“You're the elementary schooler! I'm going back to my room!”
 

 
He closed his eyes, getting out of bed in a huff, and fled as if escaping, all while Tong Zhao's light laughter echoed behind him.
 

 
At that moment, an announcement popped up on the screen—
 

 
“After watching the cat and dog battle, let’s rewind the timeline back to fifteen minutes ago.”
 

 
Then came a rewind effect and a recap.
 

 
The four of them got up because they heard Zhong Muxi sobbing in the hallway. Wei Zekai had done a lot of mental preparation before turning into a dog, wasting some time and falling a step behind Han Zhi, which led to him being intercepted by Tong Zhao. Wei Zekai wasted some time because he did a lot of psychological construction before he turned into a dog, and he was slower than Han Zhi, so he was intercepted by Tong Zhao.
 

 
In the end, only Han Zhi found Zhong Muxi huddled in the corner of the kitchen.
 

 
She was already thin, and now curled up into a ball, making her even less noticeable.
 

 
Whether psychologically or physically, when a person is enduring immense pain, they tend to instinctively shrink into themselves, as if doing so could reduce the area of impact, ideally getting smaller and smaller until they disappear entirely.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly noticed the knife in her hand.
 

 
Her hand, gripping the knife, trembled uncontrollably. She was making a strong effort to withstand wave after wave of negative emotions, holding back the urge to harm herself, not wanting her friends to worry or to let down their goodwill.
 

 
[What, is she having another episode?]
 

 
[Don’t say it so harshly…]
 

 
[Han Zhi, maybe you shouldn’t go over there. What if you get hurt?]
 

 
A debate erupted in the comments.
 

 
Some felt that Han Zhi shouldn’t go over and should prioritize his own safety.
 

 
Others believed that only Han Zhi could save her.
 

 
No matter how intense the arguments got, Han Zhi walked over and sat down beside her, softly calling, “Muxi.”
 

 
He called her several times before Zhong Muxi finally looked up at him, her eyes behind the lenses blurred with tears.
 

 
“Come here, let me hug you.”
 

 
Han Zhi ignored the knife in her hand and directly pulled her into his arms.
 

 
His large hand firmly grasped her shoulder, but he didn't cross any boundaries: “Unfortunately, my body temperature is a bit low. If I had a warm, furnace-like body, it would feel more comfortable to hug.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi couldn't find her voice and shook her head in his embrace.
 

 
[No… it’s already good.]
 

 
[It’s my fault. Everyone has helped me, and I can’t keep being so helpless.]
 

 
Her voice seemed choked by tears, only the audience could hear her silent thoughts.
 

 
“Feeling sad and upset is a normal reaction. Having friends around definitely helps, but it won’t make everything better immediately; no one is that powerful. Sometimes, you might even force yourself to accept their help, only to break down and cry when you’re alone at night… In those moments, you feel even worse, thinking you’re hopeless, not just disappointing your partner but also letting down your friends, and feeling like you can’t do anything right.”
 

 
As he spoke, Han Zhi’s chest vibrated softly. “Isn’t it strange? Friends who want to help you might end up being the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.”
 

 
His voice was calm, tinged with a hint of compassion.
 

 
When he spoke, it seemed like everything could be forgiven.
 

 
There are often short videos on Douyin harshly criticizing those who’ve experienced heartbreak. Even if they’re well-intentioned, Han Zhi disagreed with them.
 

 
In his eyes, pain, sorrow, and an inability to let go are all valid.
 

 
You have to forgive yourself for still loving that jerk and accept the restless nights you endure.
 

 
“No…” Zhong Muxi explained softly, “It’s my own problem; everyone has been really good to me.”
 

 
Han Zhi: "I just noticed something."
 

 
Han Zhi: "After Muxi realized I was here, she immediately turned the blade toward herself... Seriously, a girl who is sad to the extreme only ends up hurting herself. I must make her happy again."
 

 
The detail Han Zhi noticed went unnoticed by the audience at first.
 

 
Once he pointed it out, the comments section exploded with reactions.
 

 
[Wow, Brother Zhi is so gentle, sob sob sob.]
 

 
[Let him be the sea king; it feels like he’s here to save all the suffering souls, being kind to just one girl is such a waste of talent! /dog head]
 

 
[I have a similar experience, really. If I had been a bit tougher, that jerk would already be reincarnated… I just can’t show aggression toward others. When men go crazy and take revenge on society, I go crazy and take revenge on myself.]
 

 
Many comments shared personal stories about their low points in life.
 

 
Why do sad songs sell so well?
 

 
Because there’s nothing new under the sun; the same suffering keeps happening.
 

 
It’s just that they weren’t as fortunate to meet someone like Han Zhi to guide them.
 

 
"The kitchen floor is hard; let’s find another place to talk," Han Zhi said.
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded.
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded.
 

 
Han Zhi led her to his room, directly into the bedroom.
 

 
The previously warm comments immediately changed tone.
 

 
However, what they expected didn’t happen. After Zhong Muxi sat on the edge of the bed, Han Zhi poured her a cup of hot chocolate from a thermos on his bedside desk and encouraged her to drink it slowly: “I like to have something sweet before brushing my teeth and going to bed,” he said.
 

 
Warmth spread from her fingertips, and Zhong Muxi took small sips, her cold hands and feet gradually warming up.
 

 
“Are you very concerned about what He Shun said?”
 

 
Han Zhi casually brought it up: “I heard a summary of the conversation from Tong Zhao.”
 

 
At his words, Zhong Muxi's shoulders tensed. Even though she was reluctant to admit it, she slowly nodded: “Actually… I don’t like that guy anymore, but the whole situation is so complicated. It feels like there are endless challenges to overcome. Is it that if I were just a little better, he wouldn’t leave me? Am I really that inadequate? … Maybe I am. I really hate my personality.”
 

 
She self-deprecatingly lifted the corners of her mouth: “I really envy Tong Zhao.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Hmm?”
 

 
[Tong Zhao, huh?]
 

 
[Not surprising, she's the type that easily makes other women both envious and jealous.]
 

 
“Look, a guy like He Shun would cook for her and run errands because she's good enough and worthy. I can imagine… if she were to break up, no matter how long she dated her boyfriend, it would never be as embarrassing as my situation.”
 

 
Han Zhi: [The implication that she's good enough means Muxi feels she’s not good enough or worthy.]
 

 
“I’ve never seen her when she’s heartbroken, so I can’t really judge,”
 

 
Han Zhi sat beside her, his long legs casually stretched out: “Let’s look at it from another angle. No one is inherently bad, and everyone deserves to be valued. So where does the problem lie, do you know?”
 

 
“...Me?” Zhong Muxi replied, puzzled.
 

 
Han Zhi ruffled her hair, wanting to shake some sense into this self-blaming girl: “The problem is that no one dares to voice their own needs.”
 

 
“Human nature is flawed like that; if you’re accommodating and passive, the other person will take advantage. When conflicts arise, if you first reflect on yourself, they will seize the opportunity. A woman who always says yes will eventually encounter… or foster a man who always says no.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi lowered her head: “It’s all because I’m too soft.”
 

 
“Softness can translate to being too considerate, too gentle, too thoughtful of others.”
 

 
Han Zhi’s gentle praise made her feel a bit shy and warm.
 

 
Was she really as good as he said?
 

 
She only said, “Tong Zhao is really impressive. Sometimes I wish I could be as amazing as her.”
 

 
Han Zhi inwardly gasped.
 

 
Having a difficult woman like Tong Zhao was enough; being too much like her might not be a good thing.
 

 
“Don’t set so many goals. Trying to become someone else is very hard. Even if you really manage to imitate them, there’s nothing to be particularly proud of,” Han Zhi said as he took the fruit knife from her hand and placed it on the nightstand, then intertwined his fingers with hers. “If you’re a meat bun, Tong Zhao might be a particularly beautiful fruit hard candy. That’s okay; a round, plump meat bun can be very endearing. I love eating those.”
 

 
He pinched her cheek, which was indeed soft like a bun.
 

 
Han Zhi’s metaphor made her laugh.
 

 
Fruit hard candy sounded sweet and appealing.
 

 
But the way he described the meat bun—round and plump—made it seem cute as well.
 

 
After looking at it from a different angle, she felt much of the gloom in her chest dissipate.
 

 
Before this, Zhong Muxi had desperately denied herself, wanting to escape from the weak and tearful ‘Zhong Muxi.’ Becoming someone else felt too difficult; it would be better to just disappear.
 
But now ......
 

 
She admitted, “I seem to get upset more easily than others.”
 

 
Han Zhi replied, “Yeah, feeling sad is normal.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi felt a bit shy, “I want to try accepting this tearful side of myself. Actually, I've managed to avoid self-harm these days. The scars on my hands are all old ones now…”
 

 
The production team had female staff members who felt sorry for her and secretly adjusted the data to help her wounds heal faster.
 

 
The scar near her arm had completely healed, leaving only an ugly dark mark.
 

 
She raised her hand, the light highlighting the particularly deep scar:
 

 
“Isn’t it ugly? But no matter how ugly it is, it’s still my hand. I want to learn to accept myself, like you said.”
 

 
At this moment, aside from a few radical comments, the mainstream voices in the comments were mostly encouraging her.
 

 
[Not ugly at all! Let’s start over!]
 

 
[Plastic surgery techniques are advanced now; what’s this sister’s Weibo? I want to recommend her a hospital.]
 

 
[Some people just have a lower tolerance. She hasn’t harmed anyone, right? She’s trying her best. Although I’ve never self-harmed and don’t encourage it, I’ve experienced moments when I wanted to die. The last time was when I discovered my boyfriend was complaining to his friends that I wasn’t as pretty as others, while I was the one willing to split the bill on dates. That’s why I fell asleep first—because I understood how hard it was for him.]
 

 
“Let me see.”
 

 
Han Zhi took her other hand. She felt a bit embarrassed and tried to pull it back, but he held it more firmly.
 

 
His fingertips gently traced her skin for a moment: “It’s really clear.”
 

 
“Yeah, it’s been a long time.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi lowered her head.
 

 
“Wait for me a moment.”
 

 
Han Zhi stood up, walked to the desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved a sketch of Zhong Muxi, handing it to her. Then he rummaged through his suitcase: “I remember introducing myself on the first day. I write novels, but drawing is also one of my many interests.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi took the sketch and froze.
 

 
This page captured her expression perfectly, with just the right amount of enhancement. It showed the kind of beauty she only saw when she stood in front of the mirror after a shower without her glasses. The gentle, timid look between her brows left her staring for quite a while, until Han Zhi pulled a chair to sit in front of her and took her arm, bringing her back to reality.
 

 
Han Zhi held a freshly unwrapped small palette.
 

 
There weren’t many colors, only twelve.
 

 
“There’s a box here that can be used on skin. Do you mind if I borrow your hand for a bit?” Han Zhi glanced at her, and Zhong Muxi quickly shook her head to show she didn’t mind.
 

 
Zhong Muxi thought:
 

 
[Although I don’t know what Han Zhi is planning to do…]
 

 
[He’s already helped me so much; whatever he wants to do with my hand, I’ll agree to it.]
 
Han Zhi dipped the brush in water and began to trace her arm.
 

 
He didn’t choose the fair skin; he worked on the scars.
 

 
Under his brush, the deep, flesh-colored scars were transformed into a shade of pale green.
 

 
Then, he painted small, round white lanterns one after another.
 

 
Finally, a string of lilies of the valley sprang to life on Zhong Muxi’s arm.
 

 
“The language of lilies of the valley is ‘happiness returns,’” Han Zhi casually placed the painting tools on the nearby desk, lifted her arm, and gently blew on it a few times to let the paint dry to a semi-dry state. “In the past, other men may have brought you happiness and then left… It’s okay; this time, the happiness you find is your own, not because of others, and certainly not because of me.”
 

 
The ugly scars turned into a string of charming lilies of the valley under his brush.
 

 
Zhong Muxi thought of what he said about the meat bun—
 

 
“These lilies of the valley kind of look like meat buns.”
 

 
After saying this, she couldn’t help but laugh at herself.
 

 
Han Zhi thought: [It’s good that you can smile.]
 

 
After chatting with her for a while, the paint on her arm dried. Noticing her face showed a bit of fatigue, Han Zhi suggested she wash up in his bathroom and sleep directly in his room while he would take the couch in the living room. Zhong Muxi felt a bit shy, clutching the bed sheet, her delicate face showing hesitation after taking off her clunky glasses: “Isn’t that a bit much? You shouldn’t have to sleep on the couch…”
 

 
“I’m not comfortable with you going back to your room alone,”
 

 
Han Zhi leaned down, allowing her, with her poor eyesight, to see his face clearly: “You’re very cute. Be good and don’t say such tempting things to me.”
 

 
With that, he turned off the room light with a snap and left, closing the door behind him.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was left with a flushed face after being teased.
 

 
At this moment, she had completely forgotten the name of the scumbag, her mind filled only with those gentle eyes.
 

 
The next morning, when Han Zhi brought up his sea king mission, she agreed without hesitation: “Actually, you don’t even need to mention it; I would fill in your name anyway.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled, “I’m so happy.”
 

 
In contrast to their harmony, another sea king was in chaos.
 

 
Tong Zhao was woken up by Wei Zekai.
 

 
This guy had gotten up early, excited to make breakfast for his girlfriend using online tutorials and kitchen ingredients. Knowing the principle of treating others as one would want to be treated, he made all his favorite foods—
 

 
With a combination of low blood sugar and morning grumpiness, Tong Zhao shuffled in her slippers, staring at the steaming food on the table.
 

 
Fried chicken, French fries, pudding, and a bottle of soda.
 

 
No one dislikes junk food!
 

 
This was something Wei Zekai firmly believed.
 

 
Even though they had a dedicated chef at home providing nutritious meals, he would sometimes get the urge to eat spicy hotpot early in the morning. With his robust stomach, he had never suffered from his peculiar dietary preferences.
 

 
Now, he had piled all his favorite foods in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
“I made it myself,” Wei Zekai said modestly.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond, just looking at him with her beautiful eyes, heavy with emotion.
 

 
[Your Highness, calm down! Murder is against the law!]
 

 
[Who eats this for breakfast, hahaha…]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Crazy…]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, it’s not nice to refuse something made by hand.]
 

 
When she first got up, her mind was a bit foggy. She looked fierce, but really she was just a paper tiger, more easygoing than usual.
 

 
She picked up a piece of fried chicken and took a bite.
 

 
The fried chicken was raw inside.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t swallow, glancing at the cross-section of the chicken on her chopsticks, which was completely undercooked.
 

 
She turned her head and spat the small piece she had bitten into the trash can.
 

 
Tong Zhao grabbed a handful of fries sprinkled with salt.
 

 
The fries were also undercooked.
 

 
And what she thought was salt turned out to be sugar.
 

 
The half-cooked taste, mixed with oil and sugar's sweetness, created a very peculiar flavor.
 

 
Since the fries were store-bought frozen ones, they achieved an impressive contrast of hot on the outside and frozen on the inside.
 

 
In her past life, she had committed crimes; in this life, she was eating food made by Wei Zekai.
 

 
At first, Wei Zekai was too embarrassed to look at her and didn’t notice she had spat out the chicken. Finally, he gathered his courage and turned to her: “Tasty, right? Don’t worry, I’m not one of those dads who just hands off the cooking. If I had kids, I would definitely make them cute bento boxes myself.”
 
......
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly felt the desire to be child-free for the first time.
 

 
This half-cooked gift made her a bit more awake: “You sit down and try it yourself.”
 

 
“I made it for you, so eat more if you like it.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Hehe, all the good stuff is for her; I’m such a good man!]
 

 
Under Tong Zhao's insistence, Wei Zekai finally tasted his own cooking, and his proud demeanor quickly turned sheepish. Tong Zhao rubbed her forehead, her mind now fully alert: “Forget it, I’ll go…” She intended to say she’d cook, but the words changed: “I’ll go find Sister Muxi.”
 

 
As long as the world doesn’t explode, Tong Zhao won’t work.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt they were already in a relationship, so it was natural to include her in his list of crushes.
 

 
When he boasted about this to Tong Zhao, she paused for a moment: “You have to learn from your mistakes, little puppy.”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t understand the saying and asked, “I want to hold hands.”
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the end, the two sea kings exchanged phones and filled in each other's names, fulfilling the conditions for the game—
 

 
Neither of them trusted the other, so exchanging phones felt the safest.
 

 
With the two sea kings clearing the level, the game ended early.
 

 
When the sun rose the next day, the remaining civilian players woke up to notifications that the event had concluded. The rooms of the two were already cleaned out and empty. Meanwhile, that previous night, under Han Zhi’s humanitarian guidance, Wei Zekai learned how to make a proper breakfast, but it remained untouched and cold, waiting for its owner.
 

 
Everyone woke up in the holographic filming chamber.
 

 
The female staff member responsible for waking Wei Zekai had red eyes and couldn’t help but say to him, “You’ve had it really tough.”
 

 
“Huh? What do you mean?”
 

 
With no memory of what had happened, Wei Zekai still didn’t know he had been completely betrayed by his good friend.
# Chapter50
Wei Zekai felt a bit uneasy as he was met with sympathetic looks.
 

 
After coming out of the holographic chamber, he was physiologically fatigued, and the staff wouldn’t engage with the actors unless necessary. They only reminded him, “There’s a small celebration dinner at six o’clock the day after tomorrow. The director has reserved a hot pot restaurant nearby, so if you’re free, come join us for a nice meal.”
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded, “I’ll see how it goes.”
 

 
He didn’t feel particularly tired; he was just a bit dazed, like after an intense gaming session where he couldn’t even remember which hero he had chosen, only vaguely aware that he had played some frustrating games.
 

 
After returning to his room, he still didn’t want to sleep, so he pulled out his phone to message Tong Zhao.
 

 
Upon opening his phone, he was shocked to see dozens of missed calls and over a hundred unread WeChat messages, with chaotic group chats all @-ing him, most likely related to the airing of "Sea King Killer." It was overwhelming, and he didn’t want to sift through it all, so he just checked the pinned messages.
 

 
His pinned messages were simple.
 

 
Parents, family group, Zeshan Investment Company management group, and Tong Zhao.
 

 
Dad: “You look just like your mom.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was puzzled and wanted to reply, “Dad, are you okay?”
 

 
But thinking about how he needed funding during his startup period, he decided against saying anything offensive. Instead, he replied, “I inherited my mom’s beauty, but my IQ and business sense are all thanks to your good genes, Dad!”
 

 
It seemed he had a talent for flattery.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt he had sacrificed a lot for the company.
 

 
However, after seeing that reply, his father’s blood pressure skyrocketed—that was a story for another time.
 

 
Mom: “Xiao Kai, bring Tong Zhao over for dinner when you have time.”
 

 
It was a small matter.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai found it a bit strange that his mother suddenly mentioned Tong Zhao, he readily agreed.
 

 
Perhaps it was because his friend's movie was a big hit, and Tong Zhao was now a rising star; maybe his mom was curious to see her in person so she could brag to her mahjong buddies. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that was the case. A slight smile appeared on his lips, filled with the joy of “My brother is popular, and I look good because of it.”
 

 
Just as Wei Zekai was feeling pleased, he opened the company group chat to check if his team had caused any trouble while he was busy filming a variety show.
 

 
He was somewhat worried before clicking in.
 

 
If there weren’t any major issues, would they really be @-ing him so vigorously?
 

 
But when he opened it, he saw:
 

 
Second Generation A: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
Second Generation B: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
Second Generation C: “@Wei Zekai Boss, you’re so unfortunate.”
 

 
...
 

 
They were lined up in formation. Wei Zekai snorted coldly; there were always troublemakers trying to get to him.
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I have billions to inherit, what about you?”
 

 
Unfortunate?
 

 
Impossible; “unfortunate” wasn’t in Wei Zekai’s dictionary.
 

 
Seeing Wei Zekai flaunt his wealth broke the defenses of the second-generation crowd—
 

 
Their families were wealthy too, but they had siblings to split the inheritance, and the degree of wealth could vary drastically among rich second-generation individuals. The Wei family’s wealth was something the other second-generation members looked up to. Wei Zekai could become their leader not only because of his arrogant personality but also largely due to having a good father.
 

 
Second Generation C: "You have billions, but you can’t get our Sister Zhao!"
 

 
Everyone chimed in with agreement.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt even more annoyed by this group of brats: "Why would I want Tong Zhao? She’s a person, not an object. Show some respect for your esteemed strategist!"
 

 
The title "esteemed strategist" was so cringeworthy that the entire management team burst into laughter, urging him to quickly watch the replay of "Sea King Kill." Someone even suggested they all go watch together: "Why not just go to the Boss's house? He has an IMAX and holographic setup."
 

 
Wei Zekai thought about it; his mom had said she wanted to meet Tong Zhao.
 

 
After all, they were brothers. Meeting one was the same as meeting a bunch: "Sure, let’s go together."
 

 
When Wei Zekai mentioned it to Tong Zhao, she agreed, so she packed her bags and hopped into his flashy sports car, heading straight for the Wei family home. Before they left, Wei Zekai had mentioned bringing a friend home. To him, it was a minor matter—there was plenty of food at home, and the chef could handle a gathering of ten or so people. If they needed more help, borrowing from a neighbor was also an option.
 

 
“Xiao Kai said he’s bringing Tong Zhao back to see his screen debut,”
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Wei’s mother frowned, saying, “They’re coming now? This is too sudden; I’m not prepared at all. Would it be too tacky to give a big red envelope? How thick does it need to be to seem sincere?”
 

 
The girl’s purse was small; a little makeup and her phone would fill it up, and a thick red envelope wouldn’t fit.
 

 
Wei’s grandmother suggested, “How about getting a gold bracelet from the safe?”
 

 
“Gold jewelry seems a bit old-fashioned these days.”
 

 
“Gold is great; I love gold,” Wei’s grandmother muttered.
 

 
“Who cares!” Wei’s father interjected, his teeth grinding: “Didn’t you hear what they said on the show? He plans to spend three million a month on his girlfriend. Instead of giving her a red envelope, he should just halve his allowance so he doesn’t get scammed by women.”
 

 
Wei's mother smiled, "Well, didn’t Tong Zhao come to our house before? You weren’t here, so you didn’t see her in person. She’s a good kid. You can’t judge her based on variety shows; besides, if she’s after his money, that’s not a bad thing. If she’s after his money, it can last longer."
 

 
Not to mention three million; even if it doubled, it’s just a number.
 

 
Moreover, she had seen Tong Zhao in "Countdown 72 Hours," and thought the girl was quite independent and strong. It was just the script of "Sea King Kill" that made her seem like a gold digger—after all, it was clear from the beginning that the show was about outsmarting each other. Why did her little Kai forget his own responsibilities as soon as he fell in love and empty his already limited IQ?
 

 
Only those who remember their competition can be the winners who laugh last.
 

 
"You just have too many ridiculous theories."
 

 
Wei's father paused and turned around, "Are you after my money too?"
 

 
"Of course not; I’m after your good character and handsome looks."
 

 
She said with a smile.
 

 
Satisfied with the answer, Wei’s father snorted and pretended to continue reading the newspaper.
 

 
Wei’s grandmother watched for a while and felt more and more that the men of the Wei family were doomed to be scammed by women.
 

 
In any case, the whole Wei family looked forward to Tong Zhao's arrival.
 

 
……
 

 
Then, six spirited young men with wild personalities and one suspicious figure wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a mask showed up.
 

 
The suspicious figure, Tong Zhao, took off her entire disguise and stuffed it into her bag before greeting the elders politely.
 

 
Dressed in a black silk shirt and a cream-colored irregular skirt, her outfit was simple, elegant, and generous. The high heels accentuated her beautifully proportioned legs…
 

 
She was particularly polite to the elders, but when speaking to her peers, even with a smile, there was an aura that suggested she was not to be trifled with.
 

 
Seeing this, Wei’s father felt a pang of jealousy.
 

 
Vaguely recalling that the Tong family was also in business, how come their child is so poised?
 

 
Looking back at his own family, Wei's father felt increasingly annoyed.
 

 
"It’s rare to have friends over, aren’t you going to introduce them?"
 

 
Wei's mother smiled at the spirited young men.
 

 
The Wei residence was particularly large. They had originally planned to sneak in, but Tong Zhao insisted that it was rude not to announce their arrival, so they entered through the front door. Otherwise, there were plenty of ways to slip in quietly. Now, facing figures they had to treat with caution, even in front of their own parents, they felt a bit nervous.
 

 
Only Wei, the young master, was casually revealing his own background: "I’ve been starting a business recently. I used to think small, but now I've decided to make money together. They’re all shareholders in Zeshan Investment." He patted Tong Zhao’s shoulder, "This is our strategist!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao really didn’t want to be called a strategist in front of the elders.
 

 
The elders of the Wei family exchanged glances, their expressions subtly changing.
 

 
It was one thing to lose money themselves; now they were bringing someone else's child along to lose money?
 

 
What a big ambition.
 

 
Wei's father quietly observed their faces and found them all unfamiliar. He hoped they weren't the children of old friends. It was normal for him not to recognize them; those willing to hang out with Wei Zekai, fully aware of his reputation as the "reverse alchemist," "charitable gambling king of the investment world," and "most ambitious spendthrift," were likely from wealthy families themselves.
 

 
The ones he could introduce were all siblings of these spirited young men.
 

 
Wei's mother was curious: "Strategist?"
 

 
"The investment ideas were hers; I just helped her out." Wei Zekai never stole his friends’ thunder.
 

 
The Wei family elders breathed a sigh of relief—so it seemed they wouldn't suffer major losses!
 

 
Tong Zhao knew these investments would inevitably succeed.
 

 
After leaving the cabin, she didn’t first check the flattering messages about herself; instead, she looked at the projects of Zeshan Investment to ensure everything was on track as she had envisioned. The points she had reminded them about had been well addressed, confirming that making money was only a matter of time.
 

 
Even if Wei Zekai didn’t take credit, she wanted to help him make a good impression in front of the elders: "Actually, Zekai has contributed a lot. I just suggested some directions; many of the remaining details were thought up and perfected by him.”
 

 
The Wei family elders had just relaxed when their tension returned.
 

 
After understanding their intentions, Wei's mother suggested, "How about we prepare a hot pot? It’ll be fun to enjoy together, and we don’t mind joining in on the young people's activities, right?"
 

 
The young second-generation members exchanged glances.
 

 
They were aware of the content of "Sea King Kill."
 

 
It wasn’t appropriate to watch it in front of the elders!
 

 
Someone made faces at Wei Zekai, but he was completely oblivious to his friends' concerns and continued to reassure them, "No problem. Don’t worry, my family is very open-minded. You can vent your thoughts freely; there’s no need to feel awkward! Let’s watch together—it's a rare family activity!"
 

 
…
 

 
No, it’s not that everyone is afraid of feeling awkward themselves.
 

 
We’re worried about YOU feeling awkward!
 

 
And it’s already becoming awkward to have to loan you out!
 

 
Since Wei Zekai had said this, everyone felt they couldn't object any longer.
 

 
"It’s quite long; will we be able to finish it?" asked one second-generation member.
 

 
"Well, we’ll be eating while watching, so we can just focus on the interactions between Tong Zhao and Boss," a rather straightforward second-generation girl cheerfully said, only to receive a collective glare from the others.
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, thought this was a great idea, so it was settled.
 

 
Not long after the instructions were given, the servants and chef cleared a large area in the banquet hall and set up a long table for the hot pot. A massive projection screen descended, and when the main lights were turned off, four pots bubbled and boiled. There was a nourishing chicken soup pot for the elders, a spicy Chongqing hot pot favored by the younger crowd, and a trendy tomato pot. The congee-based hot pot in front of Wei’s father was particularly special, with a creamy white broth that came with a seafood gout package.
 

 
The atmosphere was warm and harmonious.
 

 
Wei Zekai wasn't exaggerating; the atmosphere at his home was indeed great, with no chaotic internal conflicts.
 

 
When asked if he remembered what happened in the show, he scratched his head and said, "I can't recall clearly; the memory is a bit buried. Tong Zhao, do you remember anything?"
 

 
"It's only been a short time; I’ll probably remember everything when I wake up tomorrow."
 

 
They had gone directly to Wei's house after leaving the holographic pod.
 

 
"By the way, uncle and aunt," one of the second-generation members asked, "did you watch the last episode live?"
 

 
Since they wanted to watch the final episode with the two main characters, they missed the live broadcast and only saw the second-to-last episode, where Wei Zekai was successfully deceived by a bad woman and made a declaration of three million in love offerings... Although they didn’t know how it ended, it was undoubtedly a disaster.
 

 
Wei's mother shook her head, "I still prefer to wait for the edited version."
 

 
At first, everyone felt embarrassed for Wei Zekai and fidgeted in their seats.
 

 
But as the pot began to boil, Wei Zekai started talking excitedly: "Do you know? The day after I went in, the director told me he could tell right away that I was a talent for reality shows; he praised me for being interesting—oh, not to mention, this director really has good judgment. I knew from the moment he invited Tong Zhao that he was sharp. Can you guess how he described me?"
 

 
Tong Zhao put some vegetables into the pot first: "Cute and brainless?"
 

 
Second-generation member C: "A gem among men, a cute dog among dogs?"
 

 
Second-generation member F: "That doesn’t even rhyme!"
 

 
…
 

 
"That’s all nonsense,”
 

 
Wei Zekai shot them a defiant look: "If it weren’t for me, Wei Zekai, reality shows would be as dark as eternal night!"
 

 
...
 

 
The group exchanged glances—regardless of the director's skills, his talent for flattery was top-notch.
 

 
Wei Zekai looked so proud that it seemed his tail was about to fly up to the sky, making everyone feel a mix of irritation and amusement, shifting from "worrying about his embarrassment" to "let's just start the broadcast and let him embarrass himself, please make it raw and unfiltered!"
 

 
Tong Zhao used the public chopsticks to pick beef from each pot, enjoying her meal.
 

 
She was quite indifferent.
 

 
As an actress, whether in traditional films or reality shows, one had to let go of shame and reserve. Reality shows didn’t pursue artistic value; as long as they entertained, that was a pass. Besides, she felt confident...
 

 
Especially as Concubine Chen, she felt invincible.
 

 
[Ha,] Concubine Chen thought: [With me around, how could I possibly embarrass myself? No way.]
 

 
Duan Ge laughed and poked fun: [Oh really? You nearly ended up in a relationship with Han Zhi once.]
 

 
Concubine Chen hissed.
 

 
They were the same person.
 

 
Despite their vastly different personalities, it felt like being six and twenty at the same time. If genuine sparks were to fly, it might be a bit cringeworthy. The concubine Chen waved her fan dismissively: [This is just for fun; no one would take it seriously. Besides, it’s perfectly normal for Han Zhi to have feelings for me.]
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t deny it.
 

 
Not because he truly loved Concubine Chen, but because it would be too hurtful to refute a woman's words at that moment.
 

 
Enduring a little misunderstanding was nothing.
 

 
[No man can refuse me.]
 

 
Concubine Chen proudly set a bold statement.
 

 
The onlookers, eager for entertainment, suggested starting the broadcast with the memory-lost interaction cut from the third-to-last episode.
 

 
The dimly lit banquet hall turned dark as the huge projection screen displayed a shadowy corridor.
 

 
In the corridor, the sound of suppressed sobbing echoed softly.
 

 
"Is it haunted or something?"
 

 
Unaware of the seriousness of the situation, Wei Zekai continued to chatter, taking on the role of the main commentator.
 

 
The camera zoomed in on Zhong Muxi, who was emotionally collapsing.
 

 
The cut version of the reality show was well done, thanks to AI handling the heavy lifting, requiring only time for high-speed calculations, with all the algorithms already well-developed. Although it was a dual interaction cut of Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai, the backstory was explained in detail.
 

 
"Oh, so it’s her..."
 

 
Wei Zekai paused, seeing Han Zhi follow suit, feeling more at ease: "Mom, I’m telling you, my brother’s male subconscious is particularly reliable; if he were just a bit more focused, he’d be perfect," he said, glancing at Tong Zhao with a hint of regret. "If only you were a guy!"
 

 
A partner sipping chicken soup almost choked at his shocking words.
 

 
"Go ahead and blame Tong Zhenming."
 

 
Watching the reliable Tong Zhao wipe her mouth, she elegantly echoed his absurd logic: "It’s a chromosome issue; don’t blame me."
 

 
"Fair point, so it’s all his fault."
 

 
Wei Zekai knew all about the mess in his friend's family; genuinely noting another black mark against Tong’s father was just a matter of time before it would be settled with interest! Just then, another door in the scene slowly creaked open, and the camera shifted down to give a close-up of the anxious little corgi.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wei Zekai found it hard to accept seeing his dog's face on the big screen.
 

 
Damn it, didn’t he resolve to stop becoming a dog?
 

 
Where are your principles in this reality show, Wei Zekai!?
 

 
He calmly tried to smooth things over: "Eh, it’s my fault for being too eager to help; I should have just let Han Zhi handle it."
 

 
Just then, with the sound of another door opening, the camera shifted again.
 

 
Wei Zekai saw his good friend, Tong Zhao, holding a blanket.
 

 
No, please don’t let it be what he’s thinking! What’s going on here?!
 

 
Outside of the scene, Tong Zhao remained calm. After getting her uncle's approval, she scooped a bowl of seafood porridge from his pot. While the people in reality were eating and drinking, her persona in her mind was thoroughly enjoying the moment. The concubine remembered that she had also raised some small pets in the palace before—though "raising" meant that the servants took care of everything; she was only responsible for happily petting the dogs and cats.
 

 
As the little dog in the scene was firmly caught in the blanket, Wei Zekai turned to Tong Zhao with a look of accusation: "How can you treat me like this!"
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "I didn’t know it was you."
 

 
"Oh, so if you knew it was me, you wouldn’t have caught me?"
 

 
Tong Zhao considered, "…I would probably be even more determined."
 

 
"Our friendship dog is dead!"
 

 
"Not dead," Tong Zhao said, placing a piece of tender bone in his bowl. "I caught it, didn’t I?"
 

 
Everyone thought about it and realized she had a point.
 

 
Wei Zekai was completely wrapped up in her logic. With a large piece of bone in his bowl, he angrily picked it up to chew. This scene, witnessed by his friends, along with the dog on the big screen...
 

 
Ah, of course.
 

 
The one who loves bones is a dog.
 

 
The meat attached to the bone is the best part, so delicious that Wei Zekai’s mood stabilized a bit. He then heard his mother chuckling, commenting, "Xiao Kai is still as ticklish as he was when he was a child; how cute."
 

 
He looked up to see himself being searched by Tong Zhao, making soft, playful dog sounds.
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t believe he had this side to him.
 

 
Even if he had become a dog, he should be cool and handsome!
 

 
…
 

 
Deep breath, deep breath.
 

 
That’s a dog, that’s a dog, not him.
 

 
Next, the scene depicted Tong Zhao using her words to uncover the truth about Wei Zekai, the dog.
 

 
Second Generation A: "Hahaha, look at Boss's expression when the insider disrupts the deal—it's so vivid!"
 

 
Every time Wei's father saw this scene, he felt uncomfortable.
 

 
He quietly complained to his wife, "I told you to only have one child. Look at others with siblings competing against each other; which one didn't grow up to be clever? But our son, just a few words, and he shows his true colors—he’s really a sweet potato!"
 

 
"Have a couple more. Three brothers can take turns starting businesses; you won't be able to retire even at eighty."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Wei’s father was startled by the idea of not being able to retire at eighty and obediently fell silent for a while.
 

 
The big screen continued to show the epic battle between man and dog.
 

 
When Wei Zekai saw Tong Zhao pulling him over while he quickly tried to retreat, he exclaimed with the same surprise as the character in the scene: "This reaction speed of mine is wasted if I don’t go pro; it’s amazing."
 

 
…
 

 
Then he heard himself imagining Tong Zhao's lips were soft.
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Tong Zhao, let me explain."
 

 
The second generations chimed in: "We want to hear too."
 

 
Wei Zekai felt guilty; he was actually thinking about his brother!
 

 
However, before he could explain, he heard the Tong Zhao from the variety show teasing him, both confessing and seducing. This development was shocking—the two people on screen were ones he knew very well, yet they were playing out a fantastical scenario he had never even dreamed of. Fortunately, from the audience's perspective, he could hear Tong Zhao's inner thoughts, knowing that it was all an act.
 

 
He teasingly whispered to her, "I consider you a brother, and you want to get with me?”
 

 
This time, it was Tong Zhao who lost her composure.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "What did he say?"
 

 
Concubine Chen: "I’m going to morally kidnap a man???"
 

 
Concubine Chen: "He thinks I’m pretty good? Is he giving me a ‘nice guy’ card???"
 

 
Lu Xianzhang chuckled lightly: "This kid isn’t bad."
 

 
Tong Zhao subtly pressed her temple: "Okay, enough. My thought process isn’t the same as regular people; you all know that."
 

 
Concubine Chen was both shy and angry, huffing as she turned to leave.
 

 
However, the next heartfelt confession from Wei Zekai in the variety show instantly elevated the atmosphere of the gathering.
 

 
With the elders and friends as witnesses, Wei Zekai watched himself kiss her. This was followed by a long, passionate dog food kiss.
 

 
The expression on Wei Zekai's face was blank, and his mind was blank too.
 

 
Is this content playable? He had never expected this kind of plot!He saw Tong Zhao holding his chin with one hand, teasing him with a smile: "Elementary school student.”
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai: "How about we just watch a family-friendly movie instead?"
 

 
Second Generation A: "Very open-minded."
 

 
Second Generation B: "Feel free to roast."
 

 
Second Generation C: "No need to be embarrassed."
 

 
All echoes of Wei's earlier arrogant remarks from half an hour ago.
 

 
Tong Zhao timely added, "A rare family activity."
 

 
With his own words thrown back at him, Wei Zekai could only sit there uncomfortably until the end.
 

 
He finally understood why the staff looked at him with sympathy when he woke up from the holographic chamber.
 

 
They had laughed enough, and everyone enjoyed the hot pot together.
 

 
But the young master was left completely shattered in his views.
 

 
Such variety shows were common; compared to more traditional parents, everyone didn’t really think the two were in a relationship. After dinner, the elders said they wouldn’t disturb the kids, telling them to treat the place like home and have fun. Once the parents left, they unleashed their teasing towards the Boss like wild horses.
 

 
Wei Zekai, annoyed by the comments, said, "Looking at that scene felt like watching a stranger who looks exactly like me. No feeling, no sense of connection!”
 

 
He truly believed this from the bottom of his heart.
 

 
And because he spoke so confidently, his friends understood and believed him too.
 

 
...
 

 
That night, he gradually began to recall the details from that time.
# Chapter51
Acting in the 'Instinct' movie was a very strange experience.
 

 
When most people first watch the rough cuts after stepping out of the holographic pod, they usually think it's like an AI face-swapping program: 'I definitely didn't do that' or 'Haha, no way I could have done that.' But when they wake up in the middle of the night, with everything silent around them, and memories begin to resurface, that's when the reality of it sinks in.
 

 
So, actors with some experience don't speak so definitively.
 

 
Wei Zekai didn't know this.
 

 
Not only did he speak too definitively, but he also acted overly confident.
 

 
That night, Wei Zekai was tossing and turning on his king-size bed.
 

 
One of the benefits of being wealthy is that when you can’t sleep and you're rolling around in bed, you don't have to worry about falling off the edge. His memories started to return in stages: first, he remembered being dragged over, and then he remembered the first time he secretly kissed his close friend...
 

 
‘Ah…’
 

 
Classmate Wei knelt on his bed, hugging his head with both hands, banging his head against the mattress.
 

 
He was trying to knock out the embarrassing memories by banging his head.
 

 
But it didn’t work—it just made the memories clearer.
 

 
‘Stop thinking about it, Wei Zekai. If you're a man, you’re not allowed to think about it!’
 

 
Wei Zekai tried to command his brain.
 

 
After three minutes of scolding, his brain and mouth still hadn’t reached an agreement.
 

 
That 'relationship' with Tong Zhao had completely consumed him. With each bang of his head, the memories slowly resurfaced. Back then, he had responded to a girl’s affection for the first time, wanting to be good to her, feeling foolish yet overjoyed. The more he banged his head, the more pink bubbles seemed to pop up. Wei Zekai honestly just wanted to die.
 

 
At six in the morning, he recalled enthusiastically making breakfast, only to find she had left. The official statement informed him he had been tricked.
 

 
Tong Zhao had never chosen him as her romantic interest.
 

 
"The girl he had loved was fake.”
 

 
And then he wanted to die even more.
 

 
Having grown up in a warm, loving, sheltered family, Wei Zekai had developed a low tolerance for emotional pain. Coupled with his first experience of 'heartbreak,' he couldn't handle the overwhelming sense of betrayal and immediately broke down, crying out loud. At that moment, he remembered Tong Zhao once mentioned that she had a strange habit of waking up at 6 a.m. for meditation. So, he reached for his phone from the nightstand and called her.
 

 
'Hello?'
 

 
The call was quickly answered.
 

 
The female voice on the other end was slightly raspy, carrying a hint of drowsy laziness: 'You’re up so early? Didn’t sleep, did you… What's going on? Calling me and banging your head, are you giving me such a grand salute, young master?' She chuckled lightly, having heard the rhythmic thumping from his end.
 

 
'I couldn’t sleep. I have insomnia. I wasn’t bowing to you; I was trying to knock you out of my head.'
 

 
Wei Zekai's tone was full of resentment.
 

 
It was so amusing that Tong Zhao, despite being a bit grumpy from waking up, couldn't help but laugh: 'If you're sick, go get treatment.'
 

 
Wei Zekai sniffled and asked, 'No, seriously, I just want to know... on the variety show, did you ever like me? I’m really stuck on this. I’m so miserable.'
 

 
Before, when staff and friends said he was miserable, he didn’t feel it.
 

 
What misery? He had money, looks, a smooth life, and good health.
 

 
He never expected to be blindsided by the pain of love.
 

 
'It was just a variety show,' Tong Zhao tried to snap him out of it.
 

 
'I just want to know.'
 

 
Like everyone inexperienced in love, after a breakup, he was obsessed with whether the other person had ever truly loved him.
 

 
Seeing how pitiful he sounded, still crying, Tong Zhao called over the 'silent' Concubine Chen to help get him an answer.
 

 
Concubine Chen was merciless: [That little puppy? Pretty cute. Keep him around for a few years, and maybe I’d grow to like him.]"
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Ah, well...]
 

 
After thinking for a while, Tong Zhao said to Wei Zekai, "I did like you that night, but because the script required me to leave right after completing the task, if the show hadn’t ended, I had planned to come back and continue things with you."
 

 
The personalities in her mind, who had witnessed everything and knew the truth, all laughed at her gentleness.
 

 
Duan Ge pointed and commented: [He needed to experience the dangers of love, so he won’t be deceived by another woman in the future.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang agreed: [The emotional lessons he has to learn won’t be few; it’s just a matter of when they happen.]
 

 
[Hahaha,] Concubine Chen, who had been woken up by Tong Zhao, was even more cutting than usual: [One who’s never been in love and another whose husband took her Golden Core, slashing her from shoulder to thigh, are giving love advice—this is hilarious.]
 

 
Tong Zhao pressed her temples, trying to quiet the noisy voices in her head.
 

 
After hearing what she said, Wei Zekai was clearly much happier: "I know the *Instinct* variety show shouldn’t be mixed up with reality, and I didn’t have any improper thoughts about my friend, but… it was still my first love, right? If you had no feelings for me at all, I’d feel a bit sad. Now that I’ve heard what you said, I feel relieved and sleepy. I’m going to sleep now, and if I pass out, the next time we meet will probably be tonight. You can tell them they can leave without saying goodbye to me..."
 

 
'Wait a second,' Wei Zekai remembered something: 'You might as well stay here. That place you rented is so rundown anyway.'
 

 
'I just moved,' Tong Zhao reminded him.
 

 
"From completely unlivable to barely acceptable—I really worry about you living in such a place!"
 

 
"You're ridiculous."
 

 
Tong Zhao felt she had spoiled him too much. She smiled and scolded him before hanging up the phone.
 

 
※
 

 
After leaving Wei’s house, Tong Zhao immediately jumped into a whirlwind of nonstop work commitments.
 

 
Compared to her current schedule, filming the variety show now seemed like a vacation.
 

 
The perfume endorsement deal they had previously agreed on entered the shooting phase. Half of it involved her appearing in real life, and the other half reused the model of 'Han Zhi.' Once again, she acted out a self-directed, self-acted scenario in the commercial. The plot was simple—Han Zhi is a bartender at a bar, and every time he leans over the counter to pour drinks for customers, they catch the faint scent of [Midnight Lover] on him. The oceanic incense mixed with his strikingly handsome and devilish appearance draws the attention of a crazed admirer, A.
 

 
The admirer begins following Han Zhi after his shifts. At first, she only wanted to watch him go home and learn where he lived. But after Han Zhi entered his apartment, A remained outside, torn between conflicting emotions. Through post-production effects, the ingredients of the perfume are revealed beside A as she gazes at the apartment door.
 

 
A wants to confess her love to Han Zhi.
 

 
Unable to control herself any longer, A goes upstairs and knocks on the door.
 

 
But the person who opens the door is a stunningly beautiful woman, wearing a red camisole nightdress, her eyes half-open as she looks at the masked and hooded figure. A steps back in shock. The masculine scent that had filled her mind is replaced by the woman’s rich rose fragrance. It’s clearly an inappropriate perfume for bedtime, but it feels perfectly suited to this woman, who seems to radiate vibrant, bold charm 24 hours a day.
 

 
A mistakenly believes Tong Zhao is Han Zhi’s girlfriend, and in a fit of jealousy and rage, kills her.
 

 
After breaking into Han Zhi’s apartment, A discovers a room full of disguise tools.
 

 
By day, Han Zhi was the beautiful female violinist in the café, and by night, the handsome bartender at the bar."
 

 
“The commercial ends with a bouquet of roses that A had sent to Han Zhi at work, placed carefully in a glass vase, blooming vibrantly next to a wig. As the emotionally distraught A punches the dining table, the camera freezes on a particularly large rose falling onto the table.
 

 
...
 

 
After the commercial shoot, they moved on to the corresponding print ads. For Tong Zhao, makeup and styling were easy since she had a good foundation and took great care of herself. The makeup artist praised her skin: 'Some people your age need to apply an intense hydrating mask before makeup just to prevent it from caking.'
 

 
Once her makeup was done, Tong Zhao stepped in front of the camera and handed the hard work over to Han Zhi.
 

 
The most satisfying part of the cheat left behind by the system was the ability to share tasks.
 

 
Wei Zekai, back in middle school, once fantasized with her about how great it would be if there were two of him—one to do homework, while the other played video games. Tong Zhao pointed out that if there were two of him, they’d both just end up playing games.
 

 
Thankfully, through the various worlds she traveled, Tong Zhao had developed the habit of not shying away from trouble.
 

 
Han Zhi was speechless: [I’ve only ever shot men’s fashion editorials. I’ve never done a photo shoot as a female star.]
 

 
In the fast-travel worlds where Han Zhi had become a top-tier influencer, he dominated luxury brand endorsements with his handsome Chinese features. Whether the style was mature and warm or cold and edgy, he could easily pull it off. Just standing in front of the camera, even the smallest expression could 'murder' storage space with the number of photos taken. Shooting him was an effortless joy.
 

 
Tong Zhao flattered him: [You have the experience! You can do it!]
 

 
Well, Han Zhi couldn't resist a woman's request.
 

 
As Tong Zhao had said, he quickly adapted to shooting in a woman's body, and the results were incredible—sultry, striking, yet with a razor-sharp edge. The photographer hired by the brand was also top-notch and clicked with him immediately. After the shoot, the photographer praised her to Tong Zhao's agent: 'If these two perfumes sell exceptionally well, your girl deserves the top credit.'
 

 
'You’re that confident even before post-production?'"
 

 
Sister Chu smiled, feeling more joy when her artist was praised than when receiving compliments herself.
 

 
'Post-production doesn’t really affect Tong Zhao’s face. She can shine even with the raw footage.'
 

 
The person being praised like a goddess was currently removing her heavy makeup from the shoot and switching to a subtle, carefully thought-out look that could handle being captured by passersby. Afterward, Sister Chu sat down beside her to talk about work: 'I have one good news and one bad news. The good news is that after “Sea King’s Kill’, almost every variety show with an open slot has extended an olive branch to you. Even those with no open spots would immediately bump off someone with less star power if you showed interest.'
 

 
'And the bad news?'
 

 
'The bad news is, I don’t think it’s good for you to take on too many variety shows. Doing a few here and there is fine, but you have a lot of potential left in film. There’s no need to let the audience pigeonhole you as a variety show star. Aside from the survival show on the deserted island you’ve already committed to, I plan to turn down the rest. What do you think?'
 

 
After speaking, Sister Chu looked at Tong Zhao for her opinion.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had a certain amount of leverage when she signed with the company after the success of “The Ming Emperor Chronicles”, she had bargaining power. She didn’t want to become a puppet for the company, so even though Sister Chu spoke firmly, in the end, she still needed Tong Zhao’s agreement.
 

 
Sister Chu had prepared herself for Tong Zhao to be unhappy.
 

 
Tong Zhao: 'Hmm, understood.'
 

 
'...'
 

 
Sister Chu, who had prepared countless explanations, was stunned: 'You… don’t want to at least see which variety shows invited you?'
 

 
Even though the company had held a meeting to discuss Tong Zhao’s future direction, and Sister Chu was sure that she shouldn’t waste too much time on variety shows, Tong Zhao’s quick acceptance still caught her off guard.
 

 
'First, I trust your professional judgment and skills. Second, my schedule is only going to get busier. If I didn’t trust you, it would mean I’d have to review all the offers you’ve already gone through, wasting both time and energy. In that case, why would I have signed with the company? I could have just gone solo. I don’t care about what offers you’ve turned down; I’m only interested in knowing what resources you think are suitable for me.'
 

 
“The principle of trust: If you hire someone, trust them. If you have doubts, don’t hire them."
 

 
After listening to Tong Zhao’s explanation, the smile on Sister Chu's face became noticeably more genuine.
 

 
'There is a good project,' Sister Chu said, handing her a script. 'Take a look. If you're interested after reading it, we can arrange a meal with the screenwriter.'
 

 
The title on the cover read “Heartless Tribulation” in black text on a white background.
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted the script and glanced at her.
 

 
Sister Chu quickly explained, 'It’s not a shady dinner, I promise. If you're worried, we can meet in a public place...'
 

 
'A private room is fine,' Tong Zhao replied. Given her current level of fame, meeting in a public place would just invite attention. 'But usually, don’t people meet the director or the investors?'
 

 
'The screenwriter is the investor.'
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the script, and the screenwriter's name was written on the first page: Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
'That name seems familiar...'
 

 
Tong Zhao searched the name on Weibo, and sure enough, she found a post she had once come across and remembered.
 

 
At the time, “72 Hours Countdown” had just aired, and Shi Qianqiu had praised the film highly. Xu Zhu, on the show “Star Girl”, had voiced that Shi Qianqiu was the director she admired the most and hoped for a dream collaboration with him.
 

 
However, Shi Qianqiu’s response turned the situation into something surreal: 'Xu Zhu? I’m quite puzzled as to why she is so fixated on playing noble and sweet characters. Her true nature, from what I’ve seen in her subconscious, is the most selfish and base I’ve encountered. She’d certainly excel in that area. Besides Tong Zhao, she was the person I admired most in “72 Hours Countdown”. Most people can’t be so shamelessly selfish, but she pulls it off. She’s truly unique.'
 

 
"She's truly unique."
 

 
"I admire her the most."
 

 
Taken individually, these two statements were the praises Xu Zhu dreamed of.
 

 
But when put together...
 

 
In any case, this meant that Xu Zhu would no longer be able to ride on the fame of this major director on the show.
 

 
It was only now that Tong Zhao searched and realized that Shi Qianqiu had publicly praised her many times.
 

 
When she checked his Weibo, she found he still only followed her.
# Chapter52
Tong Zhao casually clicked "follow back."
 

 
Even if the collaboration didn’t work out in the end, it was worth making friends with a director who admired her.
 

 
'Sister Chu appreciates it, so let’s meet. I’ll take my time reading the script later. Is there anything else?'
 

 
Sister Chu handed her two more scripts.
 

 
Both were tailored for the role of the 'Sea King’s Femme Fatale.' Tong Zhao didn’t want to be typecast—she had many personalities in her memory palace, several of which had never appeared. She had asked the system, and the response was that her current mental energy was limited, insufficient to allow all personalities to emerge simultaneously. Keeping some personalities dormant was intended for her mental health. If she wanted to unlock more of her past, she needed to focus on acting and training!
 

 
According to the system, shooting instinctual films connected her consciousness, serving as a form of mental training.
 

 
It was quite an upgrade.
 

 
'I’m not interested in either of these.'
 

 
Tong Zhao declined, and Sister Chu quickly stopped trying to tell her the benefits of the two scripts, simply saying, 'If there are any types you want to play, let me know, and I’ll keep an eye out. There are actually many good ones; these two were just the most sincere offers.'
 

 
'Fantasy and martial arts would be great.'
 

 
'Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.'
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment and added, 'I don’t want to take on too many emotional roles next time.'
 

 
In recent years, there has been a show titled *What to Do if the Demon Lord Falls in Love with Me at the Same Time*, which tells the story of a matchmaking deity who dozes off and accidentally ties the female lead to two red threads. The other ends of the threads lead to two powerful figures from the righteous and evil realms. The male lead and the male supporting character wage war over her, while the little junior sister just needs to act cute and relax to ascend. The ease of gaining so much without effort while being pursued by two handsome guys is simply too enjoyable. This low-budget drama became a hit for an entire season, and since then, the industry has discovered the formula for success, leading to many more fantasy dramas centered on the competition for the female lead.
 

 
If Lu Xianzhang were to act in a similar drama...
 

 
She would probably feign weakness while secretly enhancing her strength, and when she was powerful enough, she would take out both the male lead and the supporting character with a single sword, then ascend after overcoming the tribulations and confront the matchmaking deity who tangled the red threads...
 

 
As Tong Zhao thought of this, the character of the little junior sister came alive again, cheerfully interjecting, "I’ve even thought of her immortal title! Let’s call her 'The Lonely Immortal.'"
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: "…"
 

 
Duan Ge: "Why not just make a modern cultivation film where she wears a 'kill the man' lipstick and slays all the scumbags?"
 

 
The little junior sister laughed heartily.
 

 
"Sounds good," Sister Chu nodded. "But you really are the most unique artist I’ve ever managed."
 

 
As the assistant finished packing up, the three of them walked to the underground parking lot, where a van would take her to the next promotional venue. Sister Chu continued, "Your subconscious is quite special. The Instinctual Film Association has already listed you as a subject of special attention... Don’t worry, it won’t affect your roles. If you have any psychological needs, they will recommend professionals for you."
 

 
Only then did Tong Zhao retract her worried gaze.
 

 
"Do you really not need a psychologist?" Sister Chu asked.
 

 
"If I need help, I will reach out to you first," Tong Zhao promised.
 

 
Having multiple personalities sounds cool, but it often comes with many negative traits, making one sensitive and suspicious. This was the system's way of protecting her as she experienced long lives across multiple worlds. It was different from traditional dissociative identity disorder, and seeing a psychologist would mostly be ineffective—if it were effective, the doctor would aim to eliminate her symptoms, while she felt there was nothing wrong with having so many personalities and even wanted to unlock more.
 

 
This has nothing to do with acting as a golden finger.
 

 
One person is like a chat group; Tong Zhao has long been accustomed to this unique liveliness.
 

 
Otherwise, who could share those fantastical experiences? How lonely would it be?
 

 
[No matter what happens,]
 

 
Noticing her low mood, Lu Xianchang comforted her: [We will always be here for you.]
 

 
As the elevator to the underground parking garage opened, Tong Zhao was about to say a few words to Lu Xianchang when she unexpectedly faced several dark cameras—reporters who were lurking around. Today, there were other artists in the studio, attracting some tabloid reporters eager to snap photos and write their little essays. The flash momentarily blinded them, and Tong Zhao quickly blinked twice, forcing herself to look at the cameras despite her discomfort.
 

 
The three young reporters took pictures of her emotionless face behind a black mask for a while. When they realized they weren't going to capture any new expressions, they finally pulled their eyes away from the viewfinder. One of them asked, “Isn’t Young Master Wei picking you up for work today?”
 

 
Sister Chu patted her on the shoulder and said, "Let's go.”
 

 
Tong Zhao responded with a sound of acknowledgment and continued walking without glancing aside.
 

 
The three reporters followed behind her, seemingly oblivious to her expression, and walked straight ahead.
 

 
Even without anyone responding, they fired off numerous questions, each with a sensational angle: “I heard someone saw you and Wei Zekai leaving the film set together after filming 'Aquaman Kill.' Are you two together now? Have you met his parents? What do his friends think of you? There are also rumors that you’ve moved; did Wei Zekai pay for it? His name is on the investment list for 'Aquaman Kill,' and it’s said that this variety show was created specifically to boost your popularity.”
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao had no intention of stopping to answer, the reporters continued their rapid-fire questioning while taking quick shots, trying to glean news from her expression. Unfortunately, with their barrage of malicious questions, she didn't even raise an eyebrow, leaving them with no room for speculation.
 

 
The three reporters followed all the way until they watched Tong Zhao get into the plain nanny van. Confirming they wouldn't get any gossip about Wei Zekai picking her up after work, they left reluctantly.
 

 
Once inside the car, the assistant pulled the blackout curtains and muttered, “What a bunch of flies.”
 

 
Sister Chu and Tong Zhao turned to look at her.
 

 
Realizing her mistake, the assistant quickly apologized to her two superiors.
 

 
“It’s fine; they are indeed annoying.”
 

 
As Sister Chu spoke, she complimented Tong Zhao again for her calm and composed demeanor, saying she had the aura of a superstar.
 

 
"They can't get anything out of me, so they just want to provoke me. They would love for me to start yelling and cursing, so they can rush back and write their articles."
 

 
The assistant handed Tong Zhao an eye mask and noise-canceling earplugs. After putting them on, she tried to close her eyes and rest in this brief moment of quiet.
 

 
The reporters were desperate to get a shot of her.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the type who made her manager's job much easier—
 

 
She didn't go clubbing or bar-hopping, leading a nearly ascetic lifestyle at home. Her biggest daily entertainment was brewing a cup of coffee, reading novels, watching live streams of others playing games, and occasionally playing a few rounds of Honor of Kings for practice. Sometimes, while gaming, she would have classical music playing in the background, mixed with the insults from her random teammates on her phone. The juxtaposition of high culture and the lowbrow created a kind of postmodern humor in her bedroom.
 

 
The reporters had no chance of capturing her.
 

 
Not only did they miss out on any embarrassing late-night drunken moments, but even decent street shots were incredibly rare.
 

 
The reporters had been lurking outside her apartment complex for two days, but aside from catching a glimpse of her getting into the nanny car, they had nothing to show for it.
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao had kept her personal life very low-key.
 

 
However, she was never short of news or topics of discussion.
 

 
As that entertainment reporter mentioned, rumors of her relationship with the city’s wealthiest young master circulated when they were spotted leaving the film studio together—his flashy pink sports car was hard to miss even from eight hundred miles away. She didn’t care about the news surrounding her; let them take their photos, let them say whatever they wanted, and let the fans think what they wished. Acknowledging any of it would be conceding defeat in her eyes.
 

 
Knowing that she wouldn’t easily fall asleep, Sister Chu analyzed, “The company previously discouraged you from dating, but now that 'Aquaman Kill' has performed well, everyone is saying you and Wei Zekai have great chemistry. If you really want to date, everything can be arranged. Although he’s a rich second generation, he’s handsome, and the online perception of you dating into wealth won’t be too strong. Saying it’s true love would be very convincing and enhance your public image. Plus, since you don’t want to take on movies with too much romance, it indirectly confirms that you’re in a passionate relationship…”
 

 
“That's nonsense,” Tong Zhao interrupted.
 

 
Tong Zhao waved her hand, “If you say more, I’ll get goosebumps.”
 

 
In fact, these things could be avoided.
 

 
She could tell Wei Zekai to act separately and find ways to avoid any misunderstandings.
 

 
There were countless methods; she could post on Weibo to clarify that she was single, and as long as her fans believed it, that would be enough. As long as there were no photos of them together, the rumors would soon fade…
 

 
But telling one lie requires countless others to cover it up. Tong Zhao planned to act until she could no longer perform and then retire gloriously. Did she want to maintain a persona until she was eighty? Just thinking about it was tragic. It was better to be herself, and her fans should stop fantasizing about a romance with her; that was nonexistent. At least before she secured a prestigious Best Actress award, she wouldn't even consider romance—it was just too troublesome.
 

 
Fans really had a vivid imagination.
 

 
Tong Zhao had many fans, and those who controlled the comments didn't seem too obvious.
 

 
Meanwhile, Wei Zekai was horrified to discover that every time he posted on Weibo, there were always comments urging him to be with Tong Zhao.
 

 
[They’ve moved the civil affairs bureau here, when are you getting your certificate?]
 

 
[It’s really hard to wrap this up if you don’t get married.]
 

 
[Am I shipping a fake couple? I don’t believe it, boohoo!]
 

 
Crazy!
 

 
Wei Zekai racked his brain for a way to clarify their relationship without making it seem like he was the one being rejected.
 

 
@Wei Zekai:
 

 
My dad doesn’t let me date young.
 

 
As a result, the CP fans didn’t disperse at all. A wealthy young heir actually being forbidden from dating? This intriguing tidbit quickly attracted more netizens to discuss it. Wei Zekai’s background was already dug up; he was the heir of Xiangze Group. The official account was flooded with tags, catching the chairman’s attention.
 

 
Chairman Wang didn’t have a Weibo, so he directly sent his secretary to clarify the rumors.
 

 
But how to clarify this?
 

 
The secretary was at a loss and finally decided to handle it officially, retweeting Wei Zekai’s post from the official Xiangze Group account.
 

 
[It is purely a rumor that Chairman Wei prohibits his son from dating. We urge an immediate stop to the spread of false information. Our company reserves the right to pursue legal action for infringement. Let’s start by not believing or spreading rumors!]
 

 
In just one afternoon, Wei Zekai’s original Weibo post was updated with an official label:
 

 
[This is false information and has been addressed. Details >>]
 

 
Wei Zekai was left dumbfounded.
 

 
Netizens below were laughing so hard they were almost in tears, mocking him for being single while passing the blame to his father. His father, in turn, was quick to put the blame back on him, almost giving him a concussion!
 

 
Being laughed at by netizens was one thing, but coming home to a lecture was another.
 

 
"You’ve embarrassed the family! If you’re incompetent, don’t blame your father. I’ve told you not to get addicted to video games; if you played less, you might have a girlfriend by now! What have you achieved playing games every day? Do you think games will just drop a girlfriend into your lap?"
 

 
Wei’s father scolded him. Coincidentally, his uncle had come over to discuss some matters and stayed for dinner, adding fuel to the fire: "Brother-in-law, these days, young people make friends through gaming. I heard from my daughter that she has a popular internet celebrity friend who goes out three times a month, each time to a different server! Xiao Kai, is your gaming skill just that poor?”
 

 
Wei Zekai's heart had already stopped beating from embarrassment, leaving him just a shell of himself sitting there at the dinner table.
 

 
…
 

 
With the help of her agent, Tong Zhao's first meeting with Screenwriter Shi was set in a private room at a five-star hotel restaurant.
 

 
The hotel was located by the river, and from the floor-to-ceiling windows, one could gaze at the luxurious riverside view across.
 

 
Tong Zhao arrived five minutes early, and as soon as she stepped in, a waiter greeted her with a smile, saying that Mr. Shi was waiting for her inside. "Okay, I understand." The upscale restaurant during lunch was filled with patrons quietly conversing, some beautiful girls seizing the moment for selfies, while others noticed Tong Zhao's presence and cast her curious glances.
 

 
Not causing too much commotion, Tong Zhao walked into the private room.
 

 
"Hello, Miss Tong,"
 

 
The afternoon sunlight by the river softly illuminated the man, casting him in shadow and making his features somewhat indistinct. The only clear detail was his model-like physique that the table couldn’t conceal. Upon hearing his cultured and gentle voice, combined with his profession, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but imagine a scholarly face. He rested one hand on the table’s menu, his long, elegant fingers holding a slender electronic cigarette—
 

 
Tong Zhao caught a faint scent of peach blossoms.
 

 
He turned off the electronic cigarette and put it away. "Please have a seat. Would you like to order first?"
 

 
Yuhe Xuan was a Chinese restaurant. After Tong Zhao sat down and exchanged greetings, a tea artist came to pour her a welcoming tea. The light golden liquid, brewed from osmanthus and peony, was poured from a glass pot into a small cup adorned with gold lotus leaves, filling it halfway. The fragrant tea created a warm atmosphere, and the inside of the cup was decorated with six lively red koi, symbolizing good fortune.
 

 
Tong Zhao took the menu and ordered two dishes she was particularly interested in, leaving the rest up to him.
 

 
"Is there anything you can't eat?"
 

 
"Nothing in particular, but I do prefer things a bit on the sweeter side," Tong Zhao honestly shared her preferences, not feeling the need to cater to him just because he was a renowned director.
 

 
"Let's start with a tomato and snow pear soup. At this time of year, you can't miss the drunken hairy crabs. The eel here is served without soy sauce, which balances the sweet and salty flavors nicely, so it's worth trying... By the way, could you block the light a bit? It's a bit too bright."
 

 
At Shi Qianqiu's gesture, the waiter brought over a screen to slightly shield them from the glaring light, and she was finally able to see his face clearly.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had a gentle and refined demeanor.
 

 
His deep black eyes had a hint of flirtation at the corners, adorned with a mole that added a touch of charm to his serious appearance.
 

 
This reminded Tong Zhao of the background information her agent had sent her.
 

 
Unlike the Wei and Tong families, Shi Qianqiu's family was involved in the gray industry, and even earlier, it had been purely black. Their ancestors had been astute enough to wash their reputation and transition to legitimate business, moving from black to gray, with some connections to the Hong Kong side. The information Sister Chu had found was quite limited, but fortunately, Shi Qianqiu himself was not a dangerous individual. He had previously had public spats with several celebrities and influencers due to his straightforwardness, yet he had not been harmed in any way.
 

 
In his films as a screenwriter, he didn't have actors he wanted to work with refusing to come, nor was he ever forced to shoot at gunpoint.
 

 
He wasn’t dangerous, which was why the agent hadn’t outright rejected this opportunity.
 

 
After he politely finished ordering, and the waiter stepped out, he asked, “Have you read my script?”
 

 
"I've read it; it's quite interesting. However, compared to a movie, I think it feels more like a game designed to deliberately challenge players."
 

 
She saw a hint of appreciation in his eyes.
 

 
"One of my dreams is to become a game designer for Souls-like games."
 

 
The most famous Souls-like games, such as ‘Dark Souls’, ‘Bloodborne’, and the widely discussed ‘Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice’, are known for their difficulty—exceedingly difficult.
 

 
Browser games might give you automatic pathfinding and a crit of 9999. Souls-like games also have their own version of a crit of 9999.
 

 
It's just that the small monsters hit the player with a crit of 9999.
 

 
When you die, you'll lose experience, equipment, and money, making the difficulty feel extremely hardcore to Souls-like enthusiasts.
 

 
Why is it hardcore?
 

 
Perhaps it's because their brains can withstand the constant hits from monsters, enduring the cold and ruthless game design.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded. "I can sense that from the script you wrote."
 

 
‘The Heartless Tribulation’ has a straightforward main plot.
 

 
It's a dual-protagonist film centered around a pair of Daoist partners.
 

 
The male and female protagonists are fated to be each other's companions, achieving great results through their dual cultivation. In the past, the male lead married the female lead, who only had a mid-tier fire spirit root, to enhance his cultivation. After obtaining a method for killing his wife to attain enlightenment, he encountered a suitable match, but the troubled female supporting character, harboring jealousy, led the male lead to take all the benefits. She trapped the female lead in a water prison with a life-swapping curse, forcing her to wait in fear, despair, and resentment for seven days until her death.
 

 
The female lead escapes the water prison while severely injured, descends the mountain to survive, and finds a way to seek revenge.
 

 
The only way to break the life-swapping curse is to crush the mother curse hidden in the heart of the female supporting character.
 

 
Desperate not to die in the wilderness and give her enemies an advantage, the female lead must return.
 

 
The only way to break the deadlock in the script is for the female lead to overcome her inner demons and find the legendary sword of severing emotions, sealed for a thousand years…
 

 
Tong Zhao: "There’s a high chance the female lead will die right at the start. Every time a full-dome movie is reshot, it costs a fortune."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I have plenty of money."
 

 
Tong Zhao doesn’t doubt this at all.
 

 
"I used to dream of being a writer," Shi Qianqiu naturally shifted to what seemed like an unrelated topic. "I wrote suspense novels on Jinjiang, with a grand scope. Every character was filled with doubt, and the protagonist was constantly threatened by death. Readers said each chapter was thrilling and exciting, eagerly anticipating how the subplots would be resolved and how those seemingly unsolvable problems would be tackled…”
 

 
"And then?"
 

 
The dishes were served.
 

 
Tong Zhao sipped her tea while listening to him speak.
 

 
"And then I realized I couldn’t turn it around, and I messed up."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu spread his hands, looking helpless yet candid.
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Ah, I really didn’t see that coming."
 

 
From the rhythm of their conversation, it seemed Shi Qianqiu had a talent for writing humorous novels.
 

 
"Back then, readers said the challenges I designed were really engaging. They also expected my protagonists to accomplish the impossible, to do things that were logical yet unexpected..."
 

 
"So, working with the instinctive filmmaking is quite interesting. I just need to focus on designing the challenges, and I’m very confident in that.”
 

 
"When I saw 'Countdown 72 Hours,' despite the critical NPC dying, you still managed to bring the movie to a successful conclusion,"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s originally gentle tone became filled with excitement, and his gaze toward her sparkled with enthusiasm, as if he viewed her like a game designer admires a top player, feeling that only she understands him: "It really touched me. You are the player... ah, I mean, the actress I've been looking for."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought: [System, he must have a lot in common with you.]
 

 
The system did not respond to her remark.
 

 
"Have you found the lead actor yet?"
 

 
She asked.
 

 
In this script, if viewed from the male protagonist's perspective, it’s a typical story of toxic masculinity, where he ascends, gets rich, and swaps wives—essentially fulfilling the three great joys of life.
 

 
Such a malicious subconscious is something most people truly can't handle.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu nodded happily and mentioned a name.
 

 
"Don't worry, what I, Shi Qianqiu, love most is paying attention to those uniquely styled subconscious elements. The lead in last year's hit slasher film 'Don't Look Back on Rainy Nights' was someone I recommended to Director Zhang."
 

 
At this point, he sighed regretfully, filled with sorrow over lost talent: "I initially wanted to give that supporting role to Xu Zhu, who played Feng Sisi. It was so perfect for her! Unfortunately, her manager rejected it after hearing about the character's traits and positioning. I really thought it suited her."
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was eating bamboo fungus, almost laughed and bit her tongue.
 

 
The meal was enjoyable for both host and guest. Through their conversation, Tong Zhao discovered that Shi Qianqiu was a very thoughtful screenwriter. His understanding of instinctive filmmaking possessed a level of innovation that many directors and screenwriters transitioning from traditional cinema lacked.
 

 
"The more you try to control, the more likely the performance will fall apart."
 

 
"The screenwriter can only lay out the framework and provide guidance. Rather than hoping actors follow your intentions, it’s better to understand what kind of actor you need and what their personality is like."
 

 
"Whoever performs better among the two leads will get more screen time. If one tries to dominate, the protagonist might end up being a supporting character. The male lead was aware of this possibility before signing the contract. He is very confident that no matter who I cast, they won't overshadow him."
 

 
"But I think you, Tong Zhao, should give it a try."
 

 
Tong Zhao felt quite excited listening to him.
 

 
This filming style suits her perfectly.
 

 
As for the plot...
 

 
"It's a bit similar to your past experience with Lu Xianchang. Do you want to take it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
She actually didn't like that memory very much.
 

 
That time was truly disastrous; she had just arrived and was in a state of bloody agony, feeling worse than death. The original character's memories were filled with sorrow and resentment, so the personality formed after experiencing that world was one of the least similar to Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
In cultivating immortality, one seeks to understand the heart and the path, fearing karma the most.
 

 
A magnanimous person can smile and let go of grudges, but unfortunately, Lu Xianchang hasn’t smiled since he suffered that life-threatening blow from his husband.
 

 
She only believes in a sword to resolve grudges.
 

 
Lu Xianchang said, "What harm is there in cutting once more?”
# Chapter53
Tong Zhao just nodded to confirm the schedule, and the promotion for "Heartless Tribulation" immediately kicked off.
 

 
This project had been in the pipeline for far too long.
 

 
She was added to the crew group, and before she could even send a message saying "Hello everyone, please take care of me," the chat was flooded with responses—
 

 
Director Zeng: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
Ding Jiao: "Welcome, Savior!"
 

 
…
 

 
Aside from the assistant director, the male lead, and the female supporting role, the rest were important cast members and crew.
 

 
With such a grand title thrown on her, Tong Zhao found it hard to distinguish whether it was genuine admiration or just flattery.
 

 
Fortunately, Ding Jiao, who plays the female supporting role, immediately stepped in to explain: "Brother Qiu couldn't find a satisfactory female lead. Over the years, he tried several times to hold open auditions for newcomers... but every time the female lead ended up dying in the water dungeon. If it weren't for finding you, we’d still be waiting. Although our schedules are free during the wait, no other production can compare to Brother Qiu’s!"
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng: "Brother Qiu's business skills are top-notch! [thumbs up][thumbs up]"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It's mainly about this! [gold coin][gold coin]"
 

 
Everyone burst into laughter.
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu had a gray industry background, the crew members seemed completely unafraid of him. It was just that the assistant director particularly listened to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Tong Zhao privately teased him about this, and Shi Qianqiu readily explained: "It's because he used to be addicted to gambling and ended up owing me several thousand.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "A few thousand? Really?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "A few million! [heart]"
 

 
...Alright.
 

 
Tong Zhao accepted "Heartless Tribulation," and the news of her collaboration with the renowned director Shi Qianqiu spread quickly.
 

 
The entertainment industry changes rapidly; someone who debuted a year ago is already considered a senior. When "Heartless Tribulation" was initially casting, it created quite a buzz, but after being delayed for some time, netizens struggled to recall what it was about. Fans cheered as their "sister" landed another major project, until they saw Shi Qianqiu's name, along with marketing accounts reminding them of the movie's delays—
 

 
"The fourth female lead selection flopped just three minutes into filming; the longest anyone lasted was ten minutes."
 

 
"The director known for making things difficult for actors: Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
"Shi Qianqiu: I recognized Tong Zhao's ability to solve problems."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu's words didn't seem like a mere evaluation of an actor.
 

 
Since the rise of instinctive films, two schools of thought have emerged in the directing community.
 

 
One emphasizes a highly detailed setting to ensure actors stay on the predetermined plot, striving to achieve traditional film effects during the era of instinctive cinema. This school's prominent director, Chen Shengwen, once said, "The only benefit of instinctive films is the ability to create holographic viewing experiences and grand scenes that reality cannot achieve; otherwise, there would be no point in their existence.”
 

 
The other approach is like Shi Qianqiu’s, believing that instinctive films should be shot from a completely new perspective.
 

 
"Shi Qianqiu: I see a new era in Tong Zhao."
 

 
...
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu genuinely looks forward to Tong Zhao’s professional abilities, his handsome face alone could have earned him a direct debut in acting. Thus, he became another name in her long list of rumors, and "Heartless Tribulation" was touted as their powerful collaboration.
 

 
But it wasn’t true; it didn’t exist.
 

 
Aside from work-related matters, Tong Zhao hadn’t been contacted privately by Director Shi.
 

 
Soon, "Heartless Tribulation" was restarted, and the cast gathered on the twenty-third floor of the studio.
 

 
Everything was ready.
 

 
The set modeling had already been completed; all that was missing was the female lead.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi, who played the male lead, had a strikingly handsome and resolute face. Having just turned thirty, he looked incredibly well-maintained and appeared to be in his mid-twenties—a very classic handsome man.
 

 
As soon as Tong Zhao arrived, he greeted her with a smile: "I’ve been waiting for you! This is the first time I’m looking forward to my opponent so much. I just hope I won’t lose all my scenes."
 

 
This was quite different from his confident demeanor in front of Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
"Better not go too hard on me, senior.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's humble reaction surprised Chen Zhuzhi a bit.
 

 
He had observed her previous works, and although her characters in "Countdown 72 Hours," "The Legend of Ming Emperor," and "King of the Sea" seemed vastly different in personality, they shared common traits—she was very proud, strong-willed, and openly aggressive. He speculated that when there were men to rely on, she would prefer to use them, but when they were unreliable, she could depend on herself.
 

 
Like Han Zhi, Chen Zhuzhi categorized Tong Zhao as a difficult woman.
 

 
From "Countdown 72 Hours," he could tell she would be a formidable opponent.
 

 
The contract stated that whoever performed better would be the real lead.
 

 
If one underperformed, they might lose a third of their scenes.
 

 
That was an outcome Chen Zhuzhi could not accept.
 

 
Unlike Tong Zhao, three years ago, Chen Zhuzhi faced a scandal when an ex-girlfriend reported him for domestic violence, costing him a hefty settlement. Many of his female fans left, and those who remained were somewhat clueless. However, he gradually started receiving offers for negative roles, opening up a new path for himself. Yet no film had cast him as the male lead, and "Heartless Tribulation" was his one and only opportunity.
 

 
"The downside of instinctive films is that you can’t even give the little fairy a break without losing control.”
 

 
He said this, yet ever since learning about the female lead, he had been subtly expressing his dislike for her. Instinctive films can be influenced by subconscious feelings; for instance, during "The Legend of Ming Emperor," Song Wanzhu almost left the project after a poor first impression of Tong Zhao during her audition.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi not only didn’t want to go easy on her, but also aimed to be ruthless.
 

 
Though he felt a bit guilty about the young woman, he was determined to secure the male lead role.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" had faced too many failures in casting a female lead, and Chen Zhuzhi had been persuading Shi Qianqiu to abandon the dual-lead concept and turn it into his own showcase. Shi Qianqiu had even considered it, and Tong Zhao was his last choice; if he could make her fail, his solo plan would succeed.
 

 
After all, with Tong Zhao’s current popularity, she wouldn’t lack for opportunities!
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled but said nothing.
 

 
Just then, others also wanted to chat with the rising star, and Chen Zhuzhi's feigned compliment was smoothly brushed aside.
 

 
“Zhao Zhao, I really loved your performance as Feng Yanqi!”
 

 
Ding Jiao, true to her name, was a petite girl who usually played spoiled characters. Her family ran a substantial business in another city, and she had grown up with everything going her way, so she had never faced hardship. This made her portrayals of entitled roles particularly realistic. Shi Qianqiu occasionally lamented in the group chat that while Ding Jiao was charming, she lacked the venomous edge; if only they could have Xu Zhu instead.
 

 
Ding Jiao hesitated for a long time about whether she should be angry. In the end, her girlfriends privately advised her not to let this exceptionally difficult person get to her, so she decided to act like she didn’t see it.
 

 
She wasn’t being malicious at all!
 

 
“Then I’m really happy!”
 

 
When the girl complimented her, Tong Zhao smiled, this time genuinely.
 

 
Though she hadn’t been in the industry long, her performances had been so successful that she stood out among her peers. Ding Jiao had debuted earlier and, while envious of her luck, recognized that there were roles Tong Zhao could play that she couldn’t. With no rivalry, admiration took its place.
 

 
If Tong Zhao could perform well, it would benefit everyone!
 

 
“I actually wanted to add you in the group for a while, but I was a bit shy. I thought it would feel more sincere to add you after we met and greeted each other,” Ding Jiao said, pulling her hand to exchange WeChat contacts.
 

 
Ding Jiao stuck out her pink tongue and smiled, revealing cute dimples on her cheeks.
 

 
She really did seem well-protected.
 

 
“I also watched ‘King of the sea,’ and I thought you might be even more charming in person.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “Huh? Am I not charming enough right now? I’m wearing makeup.”
 

 
Though she said that, she actually knew the reason.
 

 
Tong Zhao was still dressed low-key today.
 

 
She wore a black shirt with jeans, neatly tied her hair back in a ponytail, and donned a cap that could be pulled down to shade half her face. From a distance, all that could be seen were her elegant jawline and supple lips, making her the coolest sight on the street.
 

 
With the aura given to her by the Concubine Chen, she could easily overshadow everyone.
 

 
If she always appeared with feminine charm, it would eventually become tiresome. So unless her agent insisted on stealing the spotlight for a press event, she prioritized comfort in her outfits, opting for whatever felt best, maybe adding some cute accessories.
 

 
Like the black cap she wore, which had a pair of pointy cat ears on top.
 

 
When talking to her, Ding Jiao couldn't help but glance up, thinking she was just too cute!
 

 
She hadn’t expected Tong Zhao to be so adorably cool in person.
 

 
“Ah, it’s not that I think you’re unattractive!” Ding Jiao shook her head, frustrated with her poor expression skills. “Your features are beautiful, really; only a blind person would say otherwise. But it feels different from what I see on camera…”
 

 
Tong Zhao found the girl a bit amusing.
 

 
She smiled and asked, “In ‘King of the Sea’, do you prefer Han Zhi or Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Ding Jiao immediately displayed an embarrassed expression, clearly caught off guard.
 

 
“Ahem, I’m a fan of Han Zhi’s girlfriend…”
 

 
In Tong Zhao's mind, her other personas laughed at how popular Han Zhi was.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Underestimated, brother Zhi should show her a thing or two.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Okay.]
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, in Ding Jiao's eyes, the person in front of her seemed to change.
 

 
It was an invisible transformation that only the one being looked at could feel, something only the top traditional actors could achieve—though Ding Jiao wasn't sure, as traditional films had been declining for a long time.
 

 
Tong Zhao was already taller than her, and today she wore thick heels, making her almost a head taller.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao lowered her head, her thin lips lifting into a casual smile. Her light-colored eyes sparkled like intoxicating nectar, and the indoor lighting reflected in them, creating a starlit effect: “What about me? Don’t you like me?”
 

 
Ding Jiao felt a rush from her gaze, her ears tingling.
 

 
A woman in love wouldn’t mistake her boyfriend; that feeling belonged to her brother Zhi!
 

 
“Love, love, love!” she raised her hand in a threefold declaration of affection.
 

 
Unfortunately, that feeling faded in an instant. Tong Zhao patted her head, saying, “It doesn’t matter if you like me; I’m straight.”
 

 
“I’m straight too,” Ding Jiao retorted, covering the spot that was patted.
 

 
After that little interaction, their relationship truly became much closer. Ding Jiao was curious about the way Tong Zhao’s demeanor could change so quickly, but she liked both versions: “Ah, I always wanted that heart-fluttering feeling in a relationship, and I didn’t expect to find it in a woman. If you ever decide to change genders, you have to tell me; I’ll bring the civil affairs bureau over!”
 

 
“You have some dangerous thoughts.”
 

 
They lay in front of the holographic filming pod, and Ding Jiao kept chattering away.
 

 
Tong Zhao had to let Lu Xianzhang know in advance, so she turned to Lu Xianzhang for some company.
 

 
“Can I gossip a bit?”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “Sure.”
 

 
“Are you and Wei Zekai for real?”
 

 
Ding Jiao had heard from her dad that the Wei family was incredibly wealthy, much richer than hers.
 

 
If she were to compete for Wei Zekai, she felt she wouldn’t stand a chance.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang frowned slightly, feeling uncomfortable: “It’s fake.”
 

 
She could distinguish who her friends were, but she still had a deep-rooted resistance to men.
 

 
“That’s good; no rush to date. Nowadays, guys are just too immature. I still feel something for the Han Zhi you portrayed. Wuu, I love him so much…”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “...Thanks, but maybe love yourself a bit more.”
 

 
At this moment, the equipment started to operate, and their consciousness gradually became blurred.
 

 
---
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation"
 

 
[Main Characters]
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi as: Shao Xuanzheng
 

 
Tong Zhao as: Mu Yingchen
 

 
Ding Jiao as: Li Qiaoqiao
 

 
---
 

 
Tick, tick...
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her eyelids heavy, and pain radiated from her limbs.
 

 
The good news was that her legs hurt a bit less.
 

 
She gritted her teeth, forcing herself to open her eyes and look down.
 

 
The bad news was that the reason it hurt less was because they were submerged in ice-cold water.
 

 
Tong Zhao found herself in a water prison, surrounded by solid stone walls. Looking up, she saw a reservoir above. Water was slowly trickling in through an inlet, gradually rising in the prison... Compared to when she was first locked in, the water level had risen significantly. She estimated that in about seven days, it would reach her mouth and nose, drowning her.
 

 
The chains binding her had a mechanism that tightened slowly, restricting her movement bit by bit.
 

 
When she was first locked in, Tong Zhao could still sit and lie down to rest.
 

 
Later, as the water level rose higher and reached her calves, she could only sit.
 

 
Then…
 

 
She had already been standing for a whole day.
 

 
In front of Tong Zhao was a high platform with a sword on it.
 

 
The sword was the most ordinary kind, forged by a mortal blacksmith, and could not cut the chains that bound her.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng said to her, "My path is to leave a way out in everything; this sword is your only means of escape."
 

 
It hinted that this was a sword for her to use to end her own life.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had schemed and drugged her, shattering her golden core when she was at her weakest. Her spiritual roots were also severely damaged, making it difficult to channel spiritual energy. She had only a trace of spiritual aura protecting her, barely avoiding the issues that arose from being submerged for too long, but the pain was relentless.
 

 
To achieve the desired effect, Lu Xianzhang signaled Tong Zhao to voluntarily sign a contract refusing the pain waiver.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that she didn't need to push herself so hard.
 

 
She believed this was a good opportunity to cultivate her heart again—instinctive films were like the illusionary seas of the past in the cultivation world. If she turned on the pain waiver effect, it wouldn’t be as effective; without the bone-deep pain, how could one truly be tempered by fire? This was also why she particularly disagreed with dual cultivation; enjoying the merging of desires might enhance cultivation, but it lacked the process of refining the heart, which would eventually lead to stumbling over inner demons.
 

 
At that moment, the staff of "The Heartless Tribulation" were observing the scene.
 

 
The set designer quietly complained, "Even if Tong Zhao said she doesn't need the pain waiver, brother Shi, you shouldn't have agreed so readily! Several actors who had the pain waiver before couldn't handle it and chose to end their lives. If we scare off the leading actress on the first shot, we'll have to wait again."
 

 
The leading actress was afflicted with a life-exchanging curse; if she ended her own life, the effect would be even better.
 

 
To some extent, it would also reduce the karmic burdens entangling Shao Xuanzheng.
 

 
After activating a 50% pain waiver, the pain would be significantly alleviated.
 

 
However, the set was incredibly oppressive, accompanied by constant water sounds and rising water levels. Even actresses with strong psychological resilience chose to end their lives after trying to escape in vain.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stated emphatically:
 

 
"Practitioners should speak less falsehoods. What Shao Xuanzheng said is true; there’s a hollow section in the stone wall behind Mu Yingchen. If she pries open the sword hilt and strikes the hidden talisman against the hollow stone wall, a secret passage will be revealed. He indeed left her a way out, confident that given her condition, she wouldn’t survive outside for more than seven days and would ultimately die from the curse. Moreover, he believes that without solving the riddle, Mu Yingchen would attempt to use the sword to end her life after several tries."
 

 
The set designer continued to passionately complain, "Who would even notice that the stone wall is hollow? Are we supposed to smash our heads against it?"
 

 
"Others can't," Shi Qianqiu firmly believed in his choice of leading actress. "Tong Zhao can."
 

 
Meanwhile, the assistant director monitoring Shao Xuanzheng slowly raised a hand, saying, "Um, I don't know why, but when we officially started filming, Shao Xuanzheng hesitated for a long time and didn’t put the talisman in the sword hilt. He almost directly killed her with the sword instead.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "..."
 

 
All the staff: "..."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I believe in Tong Zhao; she will definitely find a solution in a desperate situation!"
 

 
Everyone looked at him.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "At worst, we can restart again. I have the money."
 

 
Hearing this, everyone felt relieved.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's self-persuasion tactics were very effective.
 

 
People's thoughts are inherently fleeting. Tong Zhao threatened his status as the leading man, and his wariness of her was deeply rooted in his subconscious, causing his character to be more cautious of Mu Yingchen. He would rather risk damaging his own path than allow her to rise.
 

 
...
 

 
In reality, Chen Zhuzhi was overthinking.
 

 
Even if the talisman were really hidden in the sword's hilt, Tong Zhao wouldn't think of it.
 

 
Because of her cultivation, particularly in swordsmanship, Lu Xianzhang was the most straightforward and simple-minded among all her personalities, except for Xiao Zhao (the five-year-old version of Tong Zhao at that time). Any extraneous thoughts would only interfere with her sword intent. She believed that "not cultivating a saintly heart leads to true virtue; if one seeks to become a saint, they invite all kinds of evils." Before crossing into that body, the original host often questioned why her husband betrayed her, why he chose immortality over family—
 

 
"Oh, great heaven, why have you treated me so?"
 

 
Later, that husband knelt before Lu Xianzhang, begging for her mercy, but she didn't ask further.
 

 
In short, Lu Xianzhang was not good at solving puzzles.
 

 
Under the tense gaze of the staff, she reached for the mundane sword, weakly swung it a couple of times, and her face showed visible disdain: "Forget it, I’ll just make do with this..."
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite decisive; she opted for self-destruction faster than others.
 

 
When she raised the sword towards herself, Deputy Director Zeng signaled to the logistics team that they could prepare for a restart.
 

 
"Are the instruments all set?”
 

 
“Holy crap!”
 

 
“Deputy Director, look quick!”
 

 
“That's brutal!”
 

 
Just as Deputy Director Zeng turned around, a series of sharp intakes of breath echoed from behind him.
 

 
He turned back, stunned.
 

 
Tong Zhao had directly chopped off her locked left hand, the pristine white hand falling into the water, creating a splash of crimson blossoms on the surface.
 

 
Then she raised her stump of a left hand, coldly glaring as she dipped her right fingers into the spurting blood. She lifted her right hand high, using her own blood to draw an explosive rune on the chains, and with the little remaining spiritual power she had, she shattered the iron chains.
 

 
After the golden core was destroyed, Tong Zhao had almost no spiritual energy left.
 

 
Only a small portion of her blood remained circulating in her body, close to an artery, scientifically speaking. She could have wielded the sword, but the blood on her right hand was insufficient for the spell. This was a limitation imposed by Shi Qianqiu on the actors; otherwise, they could use their spiritual power freely, and the water prison would never hold her.
 

 
This was precisely why the male lead was confident she wouldn’t escape.
 

 
Who knew someone could be so ruthless to themselves?
 

 
Next, she plunged into the icy water and mimicked her earlier actions to shatter the chains on her legs.
 

 
With her freedom restored and one hand still functioning, she had more options for escaping.
 

 
The staff exchanged confused glances and murmured:
 

 
“The female lead lost her left hand? Just like that?”
 

 
“That’s brutal! How could she do that? She hasn’t even activated the pain exemption!”
 

 
“What did you expect? A woman who can extract bullets with tweezers is not an ordinary person.”
 

 
Outside the water prison, a tall, mute, illiterate guard was stationed to prevent him from seeing anything he shouldn’t. Tong Zhao used her sword to take down this first little person, snatched his waist pouch, and placed her severed hand inside, deciding to escape from the Shao estate first.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng was moved: “Finally, we have a female lead who can successfully escape the water prison!”
 

 
"Brother Shi's challenges are really set against people."
 

 
"That's not fair," Shi Qianqiu defended himself. "Out of humanitarianism, I arranged the plot to start when the supporting character, Li Qiaoqiao, visits the Shao estate. To welcome the distinguished guest, Shao Xuanzheng made all the preparations, even hiring a theater troupe and acrobats from the common folk. That was when the guards were at their weakest..."
 

 
"Very humane."
 

 
"Even that old rascal Miyazaki would want to give you a pat on the back."
 

 
"Can't say it's hellish difficulty, just that it's impassable."
 

 
When Tong Zhao was leaving the Shao estate, she heard about today's big event.
 

 
It was said that Shao Xianzhang's partner had run away with a man practicing the demonic path, leaving behind a letter asking him not to pursue her, severing all ties.
 

 
Recently, Shao Xianzhang had been exchanging letters with Li Qiaoqiao, his childhood sweetheart, inviting her to visit, which showed he had moved on from his heartbreak.
 

 
However, it was said that Miss Li suffered from a heart ailment, and despite spending a lot of spiritual medicine, it had not improved.
 

 
Although her cultivation was not poor, Miss Li was fated to have a short life; her fate was truly unfortunate.
 

 
Though not his destined partner, Miss Li also came from a prestigious sect, making them a good match. Her temperament was much gentler than Mu Yingchen's... Moreover, with Shao Xianzhang's current level of cultivation, he didn’t need to force himself to engage in dual cultivation with someone who was his destined match to improve his skills. The rough-speaking servant chuckled, saying it was good that the woman had left, as it cleared the way for Miss Li.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled.
 

 
Indeed, not only did it clear the way for a newcomer, but she would also use her life force to extend hers.
# Chapter54
The small commotion in the water prison did not catch Shao Xuanzheng's attention.
 

 
He was fully immersed in the joy of Lady Li agreeing to visit his estate, supervising the servants who were rushing to make everything perfect. His "missing" and "suspected to have run off with a lover" partner, Mu Yingchen, had a solitary and proud personality, preferring a simple lifestyle. Initially, he didn't mind and even agreed with her belief that cultivators should not be extravagant. However, after spending time together...
 

 
It became a bit tedious.
 

 
Moreover, this simple decor often reminded Shao Xuanzheng that Mu Yingchen, despite her great talent, was of humble origins, making them incompatible.
 

 
On the other hand, Sister Li had been raised in luxury as a noble lady, enjoying lavish and ornate items. He wanted to create a good impression, to prevent her from thinking that marrying into the Shao family would mean hardship and drudgery.
 

 
But the Shao estate was just too vast.
 

 
For instance, the gardens still maintained a simple aesthetic, with small bridges and flowing water.
 

 
He instructed, "If Lady Li asks, just say it's all Mu Xianzhang's preferences. I want to leave a corner of the estate as her place until there’s a new mistress."
 

 
The servants repeatedly agreed.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng liked obedient workers who wouldn't question his decisions, preferring those who were simply devoted to him.
 

 
In the monitoring room backstage:
 

 
"Okay, this statement not only enriches his romantic persona but also implies that as long as the other party becomes his new partner, there won’t be any traces of other women in the estate... This kind of line is not something an average scumbag could say! He’s the particularly despicable type."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu praised vigorously.
 

 
Others exchanged subtle glances towards the head director.
 

 
The set designer remarked, "Brother Shi's praise really isn't something just anyone can handle."
 

 
Due to Chen Zhuzhi's history with an abusive girlfriend, his reputation within the group was not high.
 

 
Especially among the female staff, even with his charming and enthusiastic face, they still avoided him.
 

 
To win back his girlfriend's forgiveness, Chen Zhuzhi paid a hefty compensation. Besides a fixed amount, he also had to give 50% of all his earnings over the next three years to her. "The Heartless Tribulation" had been delayed for a long time, and Chen Zhuzhi wished it could be postponed even longer to avoid paying.
 

 
Unfortunately, Tong Zhao's arrival was poorly timed.
 

 
He had privately asked Shi Qianqiu if he could delay the shoot by two months. Shi Qianqiu's response was, "Your thinking is a rare breed of super scumbag, truly eye-opening. There really is no bottom to cheapness; choosing you to play Shao Xuanzheng was a wise decision. Stop dreaming—there’s no chance. If you bother me again during filming, I have that girl's WeChat. If she complains that you're harassing her or not paying her properly, you'll have to deal with my little brother from now on."
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi fell silent immediately and never brought up the idea of trying to dodge payments again.
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu mentioned "little brother," he meant his real younger brother.
 

 
All the gray businesses were managed by his brother, and the industry joked that if Shi Qianqiu's scripts failed, he'd have to go home to collect protection money.
 

 
Characters like Shao Xuanzheng, who can be ruthless to their wives and daughters, are rare in the industry.
 

 
Typically, filmmakers take shortcuts, starting the story after the wives and daughters have been killed.
 

 
They implant memories directly, eliminating the need for actors to perform these scenes, and professional psychological treatment follows, leaving little issue behind.
 

 
Some actors even expressed that filming instinctive movies deepened their understanding of humanity's darkness. They used to have impulsive thoughts during anger but no longer did after completing violent scenes, hoping to remind the audience of the importance of emotional management.
 

 
While Shao Xuanzheng was joyfully preparing to welcome his beauty, Tong Zhao was making her way down the mountain.
 

 
She couldn't take the main road.
 

 
The tip of the sword dripped with blood, and the soaked robe felt bone-chillingly cold in the wind. She had no spiritual energy to fend off the chill, so she silently endured it.
 

 
In the monitoring room, her comfort level dropped to nearly zero.
 

 
Yet her face remained expressionless.
 

 
This aligned perfectly with Mu Yingchen's character design.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was cold on the outside but passionate on the inside, embodying an uncompromising stubbornness, solitary and proud.
 

 
This sense of aloofness meant that when she was harmed by those closest to her and when Shao Xuanzheng twisted the truth, no one questioned the reality or cared about her safety.

Deputy Director Zeng exclaimed in surprise, "No wonder she can excel in post-apocalyptic films; being in the mud doesn’t dull her sharpness at all. Shi Qianqiu has a great eye for talent."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied, "It's her strong subconscious."
 

 
The woman on screen wore simple clothes; her once pristine robe now looked like tattered rags. Her wounds, casually bandaged with strips of cloth, still oozed blood, but her face remained pale and flawless. Her striking brows and eyes lacked expression yet conveyed emotion, avoiding a sense of emptiness.
 

 
Even when fate was harsh and the road ahead was perilous, her will remained unshaken.
 

 
The set designer sighed, "It's hard to imagine what she’s been through in reality to develop such a strong subconscious. Is Shi Qianqiu close to her? I noticed she rarely mentions her personal life in interviews."
 

 
"Not close. I’m not interested in the actors' personal lives," Shi Qianqiu replied with a hint of indifference.
 

 
He was more concerned about how Tong Zhao would perform.
 

 
After the female lead successfully escaped from the water prison, he set up many subplots, including one where she hides in the estate and waits for the supporting character, Li Qiaoqiao, to confront the scumbag face to face. After the confrontation, Shao Xuanzheng would likely kill her in a fit of rage, which would create a rift between him and Li Qiaoqiao. The story of his mistreatment of his wife would also spread, leading to an imperfect ending for the male lead.
 

 
There was also an option for secretly seeking help from Li Qiaoqiao.
 

 
While other instinctual screenwriters feared that actors might stray off course, Shi Qianqiu was not worried.
 

 
In his films, there were infinite possibilities!
 

 
Think they’ve gone off course?
 

 
In reality, they had simply crossed from route A to route B!
 

 
---
 

 
Crossing into route B, Tong Zhao wanted to wash herself by the stream when she suddenly heard the sound of hoofbeats approaching from the main mountain path.
 

 
Cultivators have keen senses; even with little spiritual energy left, her physique remained strong. She heard the sound of the carriage team approaching from quite a distance, so she hid quietly in the grass to observe. When the convoy came into view, it slowed down and stopped on the main road near the stream. A servant got down first, setting the footstep for a young lady dressed in luxurious attire to alight from the carriage.
 

 
This young lady was Li Qiaoqiao, whom she had met years ago as Madam Shao.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao was slightly younger than her but was no longer an ordinary girl, relying on cultivation and family spirit medicines to maintain her youthful appearance. She also put in considerable effort to preserve her beautiful, youthful face.
 

 
However, there was a stain on her embroidered shoes, which must be why she had gotten down early.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao had come to wash her feet.
 

 
In the holographic projection, Tong Zhao's disheveled state contrasted sharply with Li Qiaoqiao's delicate and glamorous appearance.
 

 
Like in traditional films, the information the audience received from the screen was very objective, highlighting the power dynamics of wealth and beauty. The female lead was on a path of reversal, requiring her to draw out the oppressive points in her early encounters. One potential issue in many films featuring Tong Zhao was pointed out by the assistant director:
 

 
"She’s too beautiful; even wrapped in rags, she has a strong presence."
 

 
Of course, Li Qiaoqiao’s actress, Ding Jiao, was a beauty; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been cast in the role.
 

 
But objectively speaking, Tong Zhao was even more beautiful.
 

 
This beauty diluted the intended contrast of strength and weakness in the character setup.
 

 
"Even though I know that anything can happen in instinct films and Director Shi likes open-ended developments—like if Mu Yingchen dies by the roadside, as long as the plot is exciting, it can still be accepted..." the props assistant said, captivated. "But for some reason, when I see Tong Zhao, I feel like her misfortune is only temporary; she’ll make a comeback any moment."
 

 
As Tong Zhao looked at Li Qiaoqiao, Director Shi zoomed in on her.
 

 
At the same time, capturing her internal monologue.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I know who she is.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [She is the childhood sweetheart that Shao Xuanzheng loves, the moonlight in his heart. I must use my life to exchange for her health.]
 

 
She calmly spoke of her husband falling in love with another woman.
 

 
Her husband and his childhood sweetheart rekindled their old flame and wanted to kill her, using her life to cure his beloved's ailment.
 

 
This contradiction would infuriate anyone, not just the parties involved.
 

 
Even the onlookers listening would feel a surge of anger.
 

 
But Tong Zhao's portrayal of Mu Yingchen was that of a cultivator whose spiritual realm was higher than that of the male lead.
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu wrote this character setup, the entire crew said his standards were too high and that he didn’t understand women at all. No woman could remain calm in the face of such things—putting aside gender stereotypes, even a man would feel anxious if he was cheated on; upon seeing the lover, he might not rush to confront them, but internally he would be seething.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was aloof and proud, not a pushover.
 

 
She shouldn't just remain silent or swallow her anger.
 

 
It was overly idealistic, like writing a novel.
 

 
At the time, Assistant Director Zeng risked doubling his debts to complain, "You’re not looking for a leading lady; you’re searching for a transcendent being!"
 

 
But unexpectedly, he found this ethereal subconscious quality.
 

 
Zeng seized the opportunity to give Li Qiaoqiao’s elegant attire several close-ups, emphasizing her noble background and carefree smile, highlighting how well she was currently living.
 

 
The Li family's entourage also played along, with Extra A following the scripted lines: "Actually, it's not too late to clean up once we arrive at the manor. Given how much Shao Xuanzheng values you, even if you arrive in a carriage, he wouldn't blame you at all."
 

 
"Ridiculous," Li Qiaoqiao laughed, her words devoid of any reproach, filled instead with excitement and joy. "Brother Shao is good to me; I can’t be impolite. He once wrote to me, saying that Mu Yingchen often offends others with her odd behavior and disregard for etiquette, which is why she never gets invited to gatherings.”
 

 
In the end, Li Qiaoqiao's voice lowered: "Mu Yingchen left without a word, and brother Shao is already very sad. I can't let him down again."
 

 
Tong Zhao's actions aligned with her cold thoughts:
 

 
【I'll wait to wash myself until they're gone.】
 

 
She managed to completely refrain from evaluating Li Qiaoqiao!
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng, who was obsessed with gambling and considered himself quite ordinary, could not imagine such a transcendent subconscious in the entertainment industry; it was simply abnormal.
 

 
Skeptical, he secretly increased the sensitivity of his detection on Tong Zhao's thoughts.
 

 
Even if he picked up some useless excess content, he could delete it in post-production; it wouldn't matter.
 

 
Unlike the orderly expression found in literary works, human thought is often chaotic and disjointed. If not filtered through AI, it could easily record things like, "Dogs like to eat feces; they are very affectionate animals. Do people seem like feces in a dog's eyes?" or, "This mountain, this water..." along with recently popular songs playing on repeat.
 

 
However, even after increasing the sensitivity, Tong Zhao's thoughts remained quiet and sparse.
 

 
Occasional phrases were delivered in a cold, deep tone, like a sword tempered and then treated in deep freeze.
 

 
After a brief rest, the Li family’s convoy resumed its journey.
 

 
Once the carriage had completely moved away, Tong Zhao went upstream to the small creek to wash off the dirt and her wounds. Without a change of clothes, she hesitated for a moment about whether to remove her tattered robe.
 

 
She considered going without clothes.
 

 
After all, she didn't mind.
 

 
...
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
"We can't just let it be, sister!"
 

 
"Can we airdrop some clean clothes for her? Come on, brother Shi, be a decent person! It's reasonable to have a clean outfit in a fantasy setting like this forest, right? I can write the code for you right now!" One of the female prop assistants, a fan of Tong Zhao, was already feeling empathetic, and now her motherly instincts were overflowing.
 

 
Fortunately, what everyone worried about didn’t happen.
 

 
Tong Zhao ultimately chose to make do with the robe she had on.
 

 
"Don't worry, if you go a little further, you'll encounter a hunter's cabin. Her path is right, and even if it’s not, I’ll adjust it to be so. There will be clean clothes inside."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu reassured the prop assistant.
 

 
Since no female actor had ever successfully escaped from the water prison before, some crew members unfamiliar with the core script were unaware of the subsequent plot.
 

 
"Is there anything else?"
 

 
The prop assistant sniffled.
 

 
She was trying hard to recall if she had written any useful prop codes.
 

 
"Of course there is."
 

 
The prop assistant's eyes lit up, while Assistant Director Zeng averted his gaze, unable to bear it.
 

 
"Inside, there’s a little girl who wants to visit Shao's residence to learn, but she encounters a hunter uncle who can't cultivate due to his poor spiritual roots. Jealous of her talent, he locks her up to produce offspring with her, hoping to have descendants with her cultivation gifts. This is the female protagonist's first mini-boss battle."
 

 
"…"
 

 
The prop assistant exclaimed, "What I meant by 'anything else' was hot food and healing medicine."
 

 
Not a mini-boss that would worsen the beautiful lady's injuries!
 

 
“Why arrange such dark and cruel plot points...?”
 

 
One of the staff posed a soul-searching question.
 

 
“This is a motivational turning point for the female protagonist; it’s not dark or cruel at all, but full of positive energy,” the mastermind explained to the subordinates. “When the male and female leads first meet, Shao Xuanzheng comes from a prestigious background, far superior to Mu Yingchen's, so she tends to believe what he says and views him as better than herself.”
 

 
“And then?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu smiled, “You’ll find out soon enough.”
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao's destination was the mortal market at the foot of the mountain.
 

 
Though she had no silver coins, thankfully, Shao Xuanzheng hadn’t taken everything she had on her. The jade pendant at her waist should fetch some money. Being from a prestigious lineage, Shao Xuanzheng had little experience dealing with mortals; when he needed something, he had servants do it for him and was mostly ignorant of worldly matters.
 

 
Before embarking on her cultivation journey, Mu Yingchen was just an ordinary child.
 

 
According to Shi Qianqiu's setup, she had stood out at the age of seven during the decade-long recruitment of disciples by the North Qing sect. After becoming a disciple, she fortuitously met Shao Xuanzheng, who was searching for his destined partner, and they became a couple through his ardent pursuit...
 

 
In any case, Tong Zhao naturally recalled her knowledge about the mortal market.
 

 
The hunter's cabin was right along the path leading her down the mountain.
 

 
When Tong Zhao spotted the hunter's cabin, she indeed walked over.
 

 
After all, her dirty robe was too conspicuous; changing into a simple coarse cloth garment would be much better.
 

 
The backstage staff, witnessing this scene, were all deeply moved—
 

 
“The plot is back on track!”
 

 
"I'm feeling so secure for the first time in brother Shi's movie."
 

 
"Thanks to Tong Zhao; she truly is the savior of our crew."
 

 
"To be honest, her note in my WeChat contacts is 'Savior,' haha..."
 

 
With the plot progressing well, everyone felt reassured.
 

 
In the monitoring footage, Tong Zhao pushed open the wooden door and asked, "Is anyone in there?"
 

 
No response.
 

 
All she heard was the sound of something kicking against the wooden boards deep inside the room.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Could they be keeping hunting dogs in the bedroom?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [But I don't hear any barking.]
 

 
The cabin was indeed very small, containing only a bedroom and various hunting trophies and bows.
 

 
The owner of the house seemed to have gone hunting.
 

 
Given that a professional dealing with fierce beasts should have medical supplies, Tong Zhao decided to search for any medicine and clean clothes inside, placing the jade pendant in a visible spot for the owner to exchange for money.
 

 
As if sensing that Tong Zhao didn't intend to leave and was wandering around the cabin, the sound of kicking from the bedroom intensified. Confused by the strange noise, she said, "Sorry for intruding," unlocked the door, and pushed it open—
 

 
Inside was a young woman whose hands and feet were bound with ropes and her mouth stuffed with cloth.
 

 
Upon seeing Tong Zhao, she widened her eyes in shock.
 

 
"……"
 

 
Tong Zhao truly did not expect this turn of events.
 

 
Having been in seclusion at Shao's Manor, she had distanced herself from worldly troubles for quite a while.
 

 
She only intended to borrow some clothing and medical supplies.
 

 
Crouching down, she used her sword to cut the ropes binding the young woman.
 

 
Once her hands were free and she removed the cloth from her mouth, the woman stared blankly for a moment before grabbing Tong Zhao's hand as if in a daze: "Who are you? You need to leave quickly. He will definitely come back before dark, and when he does, you'll suffer just like I have... Please, hurry..."
 

 
As she spoke, her gaze fell on the sword in Tong Zhao's hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought the woman wanted her to kill the villain to save her from her torment.
 

 
Indeed, hope shone in the woman's eyes.
 

 
But her plea was not what Tong Zhao had imagined.
 

 
The woman asked, "Before you go, could you kill me?"
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao was even more confused.
 

 
In this scene, the woman exuded a dignified beauty, lacking the seductive charm often seen in "Sea King's Kill," making her appear honest and reliable. From the beginning, even while trapped in the water prison, her expressions had been resolute, but now she showed signs of confusion.
 

 
The props assistant remarked, "Aww, that’s kind of cute."
 

 
Beyond the fangirl filter, others nodded in agreement: "That's the charm of a contrast, right?"
 

 
"Why would I want to kill you? Explain yourself, and then I’ll leave."
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn't particularly afraid of the cabin's owner.
 

 
After failing to convince her, the woman glanced out the window at the sky, estimating that there was still some time before sunset, and quickly began to explain her situation. In a hushed voice, she said, "Are you a passing traveler? I don’t want to live anymore. My parents think I went up the mountain to find a master, and that I wouldn’t come back. They probably believe their daughter forgot home after receiving guidance from an immortal. They haven’t even sent my younger brother to Shao's Manor to check if I’m really there."
 

 
If someone asked about her disappearance...
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng, being prideful, might just investigate it.
 

 
"Forget it, there's no point in asking; it would be embarrassing," the woman shook her head sadly. "I've lost my virtue and can neither go back to get married nor am I at the right age to become a disciple. That man, with the surname He, wants me to bear him a son with a water spirit root, which I absolutely refuse. He fears I'll die, so every time he goes hunting, he locks my hands and feet and stuffs my mouth. I can't even bite my tongue to end it. Dying would be better, so I wouldn't have to suffer his humiliation anymore!"
 

 
The more she spoke, the more she felt that seeking death was a good idea.
 

 
The woman grabbed Tong Zhao's right arm, pleading with her once more to end her life.
 

 
Tong Zhao remained calm and asked, "Do you want to become a disciple of Shao Xuanzheng?"
 

 
She noticed that the woman's potential was quite good. Although she hadn't received proper guidance or training, her eyes were the windows to her soul, and with their physical contact, Tong Zhao could tell that the woman was a remarkable candidate with a water spirit root. It was such a pity; over the years, countless people had wanted to become Shao Xuanzheng's disciple, yet few compared to the woman before her.
 

 
Hearing her question, the woman was momentarily taken aback and shook her head.
 

 
When it came to the topic of seeking immortality and cultivation, a flicker of life returned to her previously numb expression: "No, I admire another immortal."
 

 
Mentioning the immortal she admired, her tone became somewhat shy: "When I was just a child, I had the fortune to see Mu Xianzhang from a distance at the disciple ceremony. She had an ethereal grace, as pure as snow. Although I couldn't see her face clearly from so far away, I truly thought..."
 

 
"An immortal descending from the heavens to save all beings from suffering must be just like her.”
 

 
The woman's mental state was not healthy; after falling into memories, she appeared dazed for a while, her dirty and bruised face reflecting a dreamy longing and sense of loss.
 

 
She had been locked up in the hunter's cabin for quite some time.
 

 
Unbeknownst to her, the Mu Xianzhang from the disciple ceremony had been rumored to have abandoned her husband and "left" Shao's Manor.
 

 
"To save all beings..."
 

 
Tong Zhao introspected and objectively shattered the woman's false fantasies: "You have misunderstood her a bit. She isn’t the type to meddle in others' affairs. Forget about saving all beings; if you were to die in front of her while she was focused on her cultivation, she likely wouldn’t even save you."
 

 
"Do you know her? You don’t know her, so how can you say that? You’re judging an immortal with a mortal’s heart! If she were here, she would definitely save me!”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao deny her idol, the woman's tone became agitated.
 

 
This agitation brought some life back to her lifeless expression.
 

 
Just then, heavy footsteps accompanied by grumbling approached from nearby.
 

 
"Didn't get anything, what a bad day."
 

 
The hunter pushed open the door: "Wife, your man is back!"
 

 
The woman froze as if she had heard a cat’s call.
 

 
Tong Zhao gripped the broken sword with one hand, reluctantly admitting:
 

 
"Alright, maybe you’re right.”
# Chapter55
When the door was pushed open, the entire room was shrouded in darkness, blocked by the tall figure standing in the doorway.
 

 
The actor playing the hunter was actually an underground boxer in real life. Due to his robust build, he often made cameo appearances in instinct films to earn some extra cash. He was nearly two meters tall, and with his muscular upper body, director Shi Qianqiu still felt it wasn't enough, so he had the modeling team increase various metrics within the actor's acceptable limits—
 

 
While a person who was 1.5 meters tall might feel awkward in a body that was two meters tall, the difference between 1.8 and 1.9 meters wasn’t as jarring. This was referred to as artistic processing in instinct films, and professionals assessed how much and in what ways these adjustments could be made.
 

 
In short, the hunter standing before the two female characters looked like a massive mountain of muscle.
 

 
He exuded a strong sense of pressure, like a game boss.
 

 
Compared to this imposing figure, Tong Zhao, kneeling on one knee and facing him, looked so thin that she seemed like she could be blown away by the wind. This stark contrast provided a powerful visual shock to the audience.
 

 
"Who are you? How did you get into my home?"
 

 
The hunter frowned, his facial flesh bunching together.
 

 
He then noticed the ropes that had been untied beside his woman and, rather than feeling guilty about being discovered, became enraged: “You untied my wife! If she escapes, what will you give me in compensation?”
 

 
Saying this, he stepped forward to grab the woman.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao stood up and blocked his path.
 

 
Before she could speak, the woman grasped Tong Zhao’s calf and pleaded with the hunter, “She was just passing through. I didn’t intend to escape; please let her go. She came from Shao’s Manor, and if she goes missing for no reason, the immortal will definitely send someone to look for her. That wouldn’t be good for either of us.”
 

 
Although Tong Zhao had a sword, the disparity in their sizes was too great.
 

 
The woman had suffered at the hands of the hunter before.
 

 
His hand, large like a fan, struck her face, leaving her head ringing. To this day, her right ear still didn’t hear properly.
 

 
Tong Zhao was taken aback and turned to ask, “How do you know I came from Shao’s Manor?”
 

 
The woman was momentarily stunned as well.
 

 
She actually didn’t know Tong Zhao’s background; she had just made it up on the spot, hoping to invoke the fear of the immortal at the mountain’s peak to spare this girl’s life. She was already in a miserable situation; there was no need to drag someone else into it.
 

 
Hearing “Shao’s Manor,” hesitation appeared on the hunter's previously stormy face.
 

 
He wouldn’t dare touch anyone from the manor; he had to bow and scrape if he encountered them on the mountain road.
 

 
But if he let Tong Zhao go, he was afraid his abduction of women would be exposed.
 

 
After a moment, he pressed his voice low and stated emphatically, “This is my wife. I tied her up because we had some disagreements last night, and I didn’t want her running back to her family to complain. This place is small, so I won't be keeping guests.”
 

 
Since it was a marital conflict, he figured this poorly dressed woman wouldn’t cause any trouble.
 

 
The hunter issued his eviction order, glaring at the woman with a menacing look, warning her not to say too much.
 

 
Not wanting to implicate her, the woman shed tears while trying to urge her to leave.
 

 
But Tong Zhao seemed to ignore it all.
 

 
She raised her gaze, her eyes shining with a cold light that made the hunter's heart skip a beat. Ignoring her tattered clothing, he believed the woman's words; this was clearly a person of high status from Shao’s Manor, given her extraordinary demeanor. Her captivating eyes adorned her beautiful face, rendering even him, who loved beauty, unable to harbor any ill intentions toward her.
 

 
“She is not your wife,” Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Both their faces changed.
 

 
The hunter narrowed his eyes. “Nonsense! I’ve claimed this woman’s body; how can she not be my wife? Ask her; let her say it herself if she’s not mine!”
 

 
The woman’s face turned pale.
 

 
She hated him to the core and was reluctant to admit it.
 

 
But to protect Tong Zhao’s life, she bit her tongue, about to swallow her humiliation and confess. Just then, Tong Zhao spoke slowly again:
 

 
“She is my disciple.”
 

 
As soon as the words left her lips, the sword followed, its cold glint arriving first.
 

 
This ordinary sword was truly terrible; it was the worst sword Tong Zhao had ever used, lacking any spiritual energy to enhance it, relying solely on her swordsmanship. The hunter reacted quickly, shifting so that the sword struck his shoulder instead of a vital spot. He let out a howl, and the wound exposed the white of his bones.
 

 
“Damn woman, I don’t care where you came from; I’ll make you die here!”
 

 
He grabbed his hunting knife, moving quickly, but the injured woman reacted even faster.
 

 
So fast that the staff thought the backstage had given her some kind of cheat.
 

 
…
 

 
The prop master shook her head. “I’m not involved; this isn’t my concern.”
 

 
“The protagonist’s fighting ability is already quite high, but there’s also the subconscious influence of the actor,” Shi Qianqiu said, well aware of how actors and their character templates affect each other, knowing that much of this was Tong Zhao’s own skill.
 

 
“And it looks particularly good,” the modeler noted. “In the past, when we implanted swordsmanship data into other actors, they couldn’t match Tong Zhao’s performance. Does she have a martial arts background?”
 

 
Yes, it looked good.
 

 
Tong Zhao, with her golden core shattered and spiritual energy depleted, was no different from an ordinary person, relying on her wits.
 

 
In the cramped room, she managed to avoid being touched by the hunter.
 

 
Though skilled in archery and adept at fighting beasts, the hunter lacked experience in combat with people.
 

 
The more colors hanging from her, the more anxious he became.
 

 
Damn it, why can’t he touch her!
 

 
The 360-degree camera captured every angle, giving the post-production team plenty of opportunities to shine. Everyone was eagerly anticipating the polished final version—yet even now, Tong Zhao’s fight scenes were overly spectacular, leaving the staff holding their breath and wishing for more time to watch them fight!
 

 
The last time they felt this way was during the final dance after Concubine Chen poisoned herself.
 

 
Even though the film was still being shot, everyone felt it would become an iconic scene once aired.
 

 
This was the kind of memorable moment many actors dream of; just appearing once could fuel marketing for a long time.
 

 
Who would have thought Tong Zhao would have one in every film?
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," Feng Yanqi using tweezers to extract a bullet from her thigh became another iconic moment widely discussed on Bilibili and Douyin, needing little marketing, as the visuals were too shocking and captivating.
 

 
“I want to marry my sister who can both dance and fight! Wuwuwu!”
 

 
The props girl couldn’t contain her fangirl feelings, cupping her face in admiration.
 

 
The actor playing the hunter had previously filmed fight scenes filled with brute force, wielding a hunting knife with an imposing presence that heightened the tension. In contrast, Tong Zhao moved with calm confidence, each sword stroke seeming like a dance on the edge of a blade. Every flash of cold light sent the burly man reeling, splattering bright red blood that made eyes sting.
 

 
Ultimately, she gracefully evaded a fatal blow, twisting her wrist to deliver a precise stab, driving the sword straight into the hunter's heart.
 

 
As the long sword was pulled from the giant's chest, he collapsed with a thud.
 

 
Blood splattered across the entire back wall of the bedroom, but despite the gruesome scene, there was no joy or sorrow in her eyes. There was no exhilaration from dispatching a villain, nor relief from narrowly escaping danger.
 

 
The blood on the ordinary sword was still warm, yet she felt colder than the blade itself.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook the blood from her sword and looked at the girl who had curled up in the corner since the fight began. “What’s your name?”
 

 
“...I-I’m Qing Niang.”
 

 
Called out, Qing Niang shivered.
 

 
“Let’s go. I’ll take you home.”
 

 
...
 

 
Qing Niang kindly applied medicine to her wounds and fetched well water for her to wash her face and body. Tong Zhao found clean clothes to change into; even the coarse linen couldn't hide her stunning beauty.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao, Qing Niang couldn’t help but feel a sense of shame. She lowered her eyelids shyly and said, “Are you the immortal from Shao’s Village? I don’t want to go home. You saved me, and I don’t dare to ask for anything else—only that you accept me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was silent for a moment. “I’m not interested in women.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
“I mean as a servant.”
 

 
“I don’t need anyone to serve me.”
 

 
If she could recover her spiritual power, she could easily conjure a servant with a spell. If she couldn’t recover, and couldn’t defeat Shao Xuanzheng, she would die in seven days—what use would a servant be then? To collect her body? Not necessary.
 

 
Thinking that she was unwanted, Qing Niang’s eyes reddened.
 

 
Before she could cry, Tong Zhao reached out and patted her head. “Didn’t you say you wanted to apprentice under Mu Yingchen? Do you want to be my disciple or a servant? Think it through.”
 

 
Realizing what that meant, Qing Niang was stunned.
 

 
“Y-You are Mu Yingchen!?”
 

 
Tong Zhao affirmed with a sound.
 

 
To Qing Niang, her snow-white profile was as beautiful as something from a poem or painting. She never imagined that the person she admired was standing before her! In her eyes, Mu Yingchen was like a figure from mythology—someone to be gazed at from afar, not to be approached, let alone spoken to, much less to be accepted as a disciple.
 

 
“What’s wrong?” Tong Zhao smirked. “Am I disappointing you by being so down on my luck?”
 

 
Her previous sword was a treasured gift from her master, with a white scabbard adorned with luminous pearls. Now, she needed to use techniques even to kill a mortal, which was embarrassing.
 

 
Qing Niang shook her head vigorously, insisting she wasn’t disappointed.
 

 
Tong Zhao briefly recounted her experiences, prompting tears from Qing Niang as she angrily cursed Shao Xuanzheng, calling him worse than a beast.
 

 
“I don’t have long to live, but you have good potential. Teaching you some protective spells should be enough.”
 

 
Tong Zhao had considered seeking help from the immortal sect. But Shao Xuanzheng wasn’t a fool; he knew she had no friends. The only one who might care for her was her former sect, and he could easily ambush her on the way there. Besides, her master had ascended, and with their departure, the connections had grown cold. She struggled to navigate the complexities of human relationships.
 

 
“If you don’t want to go home, then come with me to find the Sword of Severing Emotion.”
 

 
Tong Zhao explained what the Sword of Severing Emotion was.
 

 
In the worldview of "Heartless Tribulation," each sword cultivator had a different path, leading to varied approaches in sword refining. Since she had cultivated alongside Shao Xuanzheng for years, her original goal was to master the Longqing Sword. The sword he wielded was a Longqing Sword nearing the Golden Core stage, similar to many enchanted weapons in games.
 

 
Tong Zhao had once possessed a similar sword, but he had broken it along with her Golden Core.
 

 
Every sword has its lineage.
 

 
All sword cultivators aimed to refine their swords to resemble legendary divine blades or to uncover the sword that lay within their inner demons. However, the latter was akin to a legend of the martial world, and no one had ever found it.
 

 
— Sword cultivators who break through to the Golden Core stage can enter the Valley of Ten Thousand Swords during meditation. Within it, they can cultivate and embark on trials to seek historically significant swords. At this point, a sudden sharp pain struck Tong Zhao's head, and she furrowed her brow, pressing against her temples: “There’s something very important… but I can’t remember.”
 

 
“I don’t have time to cultivate again; I can only seek out the sword that is inherently stronger than I am.”
 

 
Qing Niang asked, “This divine sword is so mysterious; where do we even start looking?”
 

 
“I know where it is,” Tong Zhao said with a wry smile, “because the original owner of the Sword of Severing Emotion is my master.”
 

 
“After severing her emotions and ascending, my master hid the sword in a secret place, knowing that I would need it someday. Sword cultivators rarely use others’ swords, so borrowing swords is not a common practice; I didn’t expect my master to foresee this.”
 

 
…
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
Everyone turned to Shi Qianqiu in disbelief: “Director Shi, you actually arranged a golden finger for the female lead? That’s not like you at all!”
 

 
“I’m a conscientious writer; every character is my cherished creation.”
 

 
His statement was met with a chorus of playful boos from backstage.
 

 
Meanwhile, in the male lead’s perspective, managed by Deputy Director Zeng, Shao Xuanzheng had won Li Qiaoqiao’s heart, and they were set to hold a couple’s ceremony soon, celebrating his impending Golden Core breakthrough. Previously, the female lead’s cultivation had outpaced his, which had always been a sore point for him. Now, with her Dan destroyed and sword broken, he was finally about to catch up to her former pace, which felt immensely satisfying.
 

 
…
 

 
As Tong Zhao and her disciple set out together, the atmosphere oddly turned warm and heartening.
 

 
Qing Niang took care of Tong Zhao’s daily needs with nimble hands, while the master, aside from practicing swordplay, was clueless about other chores, often displaying an endearingly “naive” side to onlookers. The master’s pure-hearted nature and indifferent attitude toward past events made Qing Niang feel heartbroken seeing her hand wounds, leading her to sob.
 

 
The master watched her cry for a good while.
 

 
Finally, she sighed and wiped Qing Niang’s tears with her intact right hand: “Stop crying. I’ve never seen a cultivator like you who cries every day.”
 

 
The master no longer needed to eat much, but she would always eat a little of what Qing Niang made because she worried about her going hungry.
 

 
One overflowed with maternal instinct, while the other seemed devoid of it.
 

 
Qing Niang felt that these were the happiest days of her life: she had taken her most admired master as her teacher and discovered that despite Mu Yingchen’s cold demeanor, she had many charming qualities. Qing Niang had half-jokingly and half-jealously asked her fellow disciples about the master, only to learn that she had never taken a disciple before, making this her first time.
 

 
In that moment, Qing Niang thought that even if a celestial being wanted to spend their life with her, it wouldn’t compare to the sweetness of this moment.
 

 
Following the route from memory, the two arrived at the treacherous long cave at the foot of the cliff on the third day. The environment was so dangerous that the props designer kept asking the modeling team if they had no conscience. The modeler replied, “This isn’t our fault; it was Director Shi who requested it to be more perilous and had us redo it three times.”
 

 
Everyone turned to look at the director, who had claimed to be the character’s ‘real mother.’
 

 
Trust him? Not a chance!
 

 
Deep in the cave, they indeed found the treasure box left by the master.
 

 
Inside the box, there was no sword.
 

 
Only a sword sheath and a letter, next to a forge used for sword-making.
 

 
This forge was much larger than those commonly used, and Tong Zhao suspected it had been specially crafted by her master.
 

 
The letter contained her master’s words, stating that each Zhanqing sword was unique and needed to be forged with the flesh and blood of a loved one: “Since Yingchen, you have seen this letter, it means you have made a choice between swordsmanship and love. You are my proudest disciple; neither Shao Xuanzheng's skills nor abilities can match yours. Using him as a sacrifice, you will surely forge your own Zhanqing sword.”
 

 
……
 

 
It seemed her master wanted her to kill her husband to prove her path.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit dazed, realizing her master had overlooked something.
 

 
She had come too late; she intended to use the divine sword for revenge, but what could she use now to sacrifice Shao Xuanzheng?
 

 
As she read the last line, her expression changed drastically. She crumpled the letter and threw it to the ground: “Master, what nonsense!”
 

 
……
 

 
The crew, frustrated, stomped their feet when that last line didn’t get captured on camera.
 

 
“What's written on it, brother Shi?”
 

 
Some were eager for spoilers.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pondered, then smiled with a kind, maternal expression: “A compromise choice.”
 

 
……
 

 
Throughout the journey, the master’s demeanor had always been calm.
 

 
Qing Niang had never seen her angry, and it was rare to catch her smile. Now witnessing her fury and realizing they were in a deadlock, she couldn’t help but feel anxious for her master. She crouched down to pick up the paper, wanting to brainstorm solutions, but Tong Zhao, frustrated and breathless, realized it was too late…
 

 
“If you seek the divine sword only because of harm from the Shao villain, Yingchen has another method. As long as you use a practitioner with water or fire spirit roots as a sacrifice, you can also forge a heartless sword. However, this forge can only be used once; sacrificing a loved one will yield better results, so Yingchen must be cautious.”
 

 
Qing Niang read the last line aloud, understanding why her master was so angry.
 

 
She looked at her master.
 

 
Tong Zhao snatched the letter from her hand and tore it to shreds: “Don’t even think about it; I’ll find another way.”
 

 
Find another way? How?
 

 
There was no time left.
 

 
“Regardless, Qing Niang’s life was saved by the master. If I can be of use and become the master’s sword, I’d be so happy.”
 

 
The hunter valued her water spirit root and beauty, wanting to use her to carry on his lineage. Qing Niang had once fiercely resisted, secretly vowing that if she survived, she would kill the child and take her own life, refusing to let anyone exploit her gifts.
 

 
However, this time she was glad to be a water spirit root, as it meant she could serve as the furnace for her master.
 

 
Qing Niang volunteered to be the furnace, but Tong Zhao firmly refused: "I didn't take you as my disciple to use you as a furnace for sword forging. If you still see me as your master, then this is absolutely not something you should bring up again." This was the first time she had lost her temper so severely with her disciple, giving her a stern lecture.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was about to knock her out to stop the argument, Qing Niang, with red eyes, asked, "So does that mean Master’s revenge will go unpunished? Did she die for nothing?"
 

 
"Revenge can't be paid for with your life. If I die, then it’s just me losing to that scoundrel Shao!"
 

 
The two were caught up in their heated argument, saying whatever came to mind.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished speaking, she paused, as if realizing something. When Qing Niang, daringly, tried to argue with her again, this time Tong Zhao agreed to Qing Niang's suggestion. Qing Niang was overjoyed at the thought of dedicating herself to her master, completely unaware of why her master had changed her mind. She enthusiastically took charge of the preparations for the sword forging, feeling no fear of impending death, and even a little excitement.
 

 
Her disciple still had the chance to become successful.
 

 
Becoming her master's sword meant she could stay by her master's side for a lifetime!
 

 
However, once the sword furnace ignited, Tong Zhao pressed a binding talisman onto Qing Niang's unsuspecting shoulder.
 

 
At that moment, the only part of Qing Niang that could move were her eyes.
 

 
She stared at her master in disbelief, tears streaming down her face.
 

 
"My spiritual power can only hold you with this last talisman, and it won't last long. The box contains the method for forging swords. Once the sword is made, take it and join the North Qing sect. Only seek revenge when you're fully capable; if not, focus on your cultivation and don't dwell on revenge."
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't want Qing Niang to sacrifice herself in vain.
 

 
She thought of a good reason: "The sword I forge must never lose to Shao Xuanzheng again."
 

 
With that, she leaped into the massive sword furnace.
 

 
Qing Niang's eyes widened in horror, and as the binding spell released, she knelt down, crying out for her master.
 

 
She wasn’t afraid of the heat as she clung to the edge of the furnace, her hands burned but still unaware, longing to jump in after her master.
 

 
---
 

 
Backstage.
 

 
"I told you, I'm very good to the female lead! I've arranged tasks for her step by step; there’s no dead end she can’t solve," Shi Qianqiu argued.
 

 
However, the other staff members looked at him with reproachful eyes. "Brother Shi, just wait. After this movie airs, the audience's backlash will fill an entire warehouse with criticism. I advise you to switch careers to selling knives!"
 

 
"I'm not that heartless! You all looking at me like this really hurts!"
 

 
---
 

 
In a moment, Qing Niang, crying by the furnace, suddenly felt a cool breeze.
 

 
She looked up through her tear-filled eyes, thinking she was hallucinating from her sorrow: "No, I can't let my master down; this sword must be forged..." But when she looked into the furnace, she sensed an overwhelming sword intent.
 

 
In the forest on the mountain, the resting birds and animals were startled and fled in fear.
 

 
Dark clouds gathered, and thunder rumbled.
 

 
The woman in white rose amidst the flames, wielding a long sword.
 

 
Dressed in a flowing white robe, the flames did not harm her at all, and her previously broken left hand was now whole.
 

 
Qing Niang knew her master was beautiful, but now, illuminated by the firelight, she saw her master’s face more clearly and felt an almost terrifying beauty, like a drawn blade. While beautiful, it reminded her that a single strike could very well take a life.
 

 
When her master’s gaze fell upon her, she couldn’t help but shiver again.
 

 
It was as if the sword tip pressed against her forehead, exuding an icy chill.
 

 
Her master walked towards her, stepping through the void, and gently patted her head: “I told you not to cry.”
 

 
“Master, you lied to me!”
 

 
Qing Niang felt utterly wronged.
 

 
Tong Zhao bent down to pry her fingers from the edge of the forging furnace, her palms burned and raw: “Fool, don’t you feel pain?”
 

 
"I'm not afraid with you here," Qing Niang said, holding onto her master's hand tightly.
 

 
Tong Zhao's expression remained cold, seemingly unmoved by her display of affection. She used a small spell, and Qing Niang's hand healed at a visible speed: "My spiritual power has returned... No wonder my master said it can only be used once. It fused me with the sword, and my shattered Golden Core has recovered, but now I don’t know if I’m considered human or a sword."
 

 
Qing Niang was happy for her master: "Whether you're human or a sword, you're still my master!"
 

 
Tong Zhao looked down, slightly annoyed: "You're really noisy."
 

 
Qing Niang stopped talking and cautiously looked up while hugging her master's thigh: "So, does Master still want me to go to the North Qing Sect to apprentice?"
 

 
"You can go if you want."
 

 
"I won’t go," Qing Niang shook her head vigorously. "I want to go with you to seek revenge!"
 

 
She glanced at the furnace: "If you’ve become a sword, if I jump in too, can I be your sheath? Or, we could be like Ganjiang and Moye! Better than those scoundrels!"
 

 
While searching for the secret sword, they had heard that the Shao family was holding a couple's ceremony.
 

 
Counting the days, they still had time.
# Chapter56
“What's happening with the male lead?”
 

 
No one knew who asked the question, but it jolted everyone awake.
 

 
The storylines for both sides were running in parallel, and once all scenes were shot, the main and assistant directors would decide what to cut and what to keep. This dual-lead format was somewhat like a variety show, where the more engaging subconscious would have the upper hand.
 

 
“Isn't the assistant director always watching?”
 

 
“Yes,” Assistant Director Zeng replied, “but there’s not much to see.”
 

 
Compared to the female lead, the male lead's storyline was rather lackluster.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was happily welcoming the female supporting character, enjoying food and fun at the fairy estate, creating an ideal picture of what life would be like if she stayed on as the lady of the house.
 

 
The Li family was also quite prestigious, and Li Qiaoqiao had remained unmarried due to being spoiled by her family, so there was no need for her to attach herself to anyone. Thus, Shao Xuanzheng had to show her utmost sincerity and dare not be the least bit negligent.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng and Li Qiaoqiao reminisced about the early days of their acquaintance.
 

 
Back then, Shao Xuanzheng had average talent and didn’t dare to pursue the daughter of the Li family, also wary of her heart condition. However, over the years, their dual cultivation had significantly improved his skills, and he had gained attention from his own family, allowing him to flourish in all aspects.
 

 
After Liu Bang became emperor and Han Chengwang returned to see his first love, the position of a first love in a man's heart was special.
 

 
Ascending to power, becoming wealthy, and changing wives—his new partner was the childhood sweetheart he had longed for.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt it was all worth it.
 

 
If they didn't look at the scenes with the female lead, Tong Zhao, and only focused on Shao Xuanzheng's shots, most of the male crew could feel a sense of exhilaration, even if they didn’t dare to say it outright; there was still some secret enjoyment.
 

 
Assistant Director Zeng sighed, “Chen Zhuzhi, despite his other flaws, truly excels in portraying the role of a toxic husband who finally gets his way.”
 

 
Everyone’s gaze slowly turned towards Assistant Director Zeng, then to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
The tone of praise was becoming increasingly similar.
 

 
The props assistant whispered, “But I still think the female lead’s perspective is more exciting.”
 

 
“Of course,” Shi Qianqiu nodded in agreement. “The comeback from adversity is one of the points the audience loves; for the actors, danger represents an opportunity to shine. I set up so many obstacles precisely to enhance her dramatic moments.”
 

 
Everyone then exchanged glances, questioning, “So it turns out you don’t enjoy making things difficult for the protagonist?”
 

 
In any case, Tong Zhao had endured the challenges set by the heartless director and arrived at a critical turning point.
 

 
---
 

 
“Brother Shao, do you really want to hold the couple ceremony with me?”
 

 
Although Li Qiaoqiao felt deeply moved by everything her childhood friend had prepared, she thought it was a bit too fast. She didn’t believe brother Shao was after her family background; after all, cultivators were different from mortals. His current cultivation level was vastly improved compared to before, while she was still frail, surviving only thanks to the Li family's resources. She couldn't compare to his former partner.
 

 
“As long as brother Shao wants, it wouldn’t be hard to find a partner of equal cultivation,” Li Qiaoqiao said with a furrowed brow. “I had been feeling a bit better for three days, but it worsened again last night. My condition is so unstable… why bother…”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng fixed his gaze on her, his eyes filled with tenderness and determination. “Don’t think too much. If you’re not well, I’ll take care of you slowly. I don’t want an equal partner; I just want you.”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao was deeply moved.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was speaking the truth. He truly didn’t want a partner who could match him; he wanted a well-bred lady who would always place him first, someone not like Mu Yingchen, who, despite her beauty, didn’t know how to please her husband and always overshadowed him.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had grown tired of that.
 

 
At this moment, he was full of patience for Li Qiaoqiao—every man is typically very patient with a woman he’s interested in but hasn’t fully claimed yet. With sweet words, he made her believe that all she needed to do was focus on her appearance and wait for the couple ceremony. Once he had calmed the anxious Li Qiaoqiao, he switched to another persona and lashed out at his subordinates.
 

 
He had known about Mu Yingchen killing the guards and escaping from the water dungeon that very night. He didn’t think much of it.
 

 
A monk might run, but the temple stays; with her shattered Golden Core and depleted spiritual power, Mu Yingchen was essentially a cripple. Let her run; she could experience the fear of death closing in. Shao Xuanzheng wasn’t worried at all, especially with Li Qiaoqiao, who was becoming increasingly well despite harboring maternal gu.
 

 
However, just yesterday, things changed.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao’s heart condition suddenly worsened that evening. After lying on the couch for an hour, her maid expertly attended to her, and Shao Xuanzheng rushed over in a panic. Seeing him more anxious than herself greatly moved Li Qiaoqiao, who then comforted him.
 

 
But what Shao Xuanzheng was truly anxious about was another matter. Li Qiaoqiao's heart condition shouldn’t have flared up again unless something had changed on Mu Yingchen’s side.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng could only think that she had gone back to her sect for help... but that shouldn’t be! He had anticipated everything she might consider. The North Qing Sect had his spies, and no matter how he inquired or tested the waters, he received no answers. Instead, the North Qing Sect felt a hint of regret for him, having heard the rumors he had spread about being “abandoned by their own disciple.”
 

 
Now it was Shao Xuanzheng who found it hard to endure.
 

 
He was filled with regret.
 

 
Not regret for the wrongs he had committed, but for not having done the job cleanly enough.
 

 
If he had known better, he shouldn’t have let his concerns for his own state of mind get in the way; he should have just killed her.
 

 
Now, he could only hasten the couple ceremony, making the Li family and himself two peas in a pod.
 

 
There are differences between men and women, and it doesn’t sound good for a woman to remarry.
 

 
Cultivators should be more carefree and not bound by trivialities, but Li Qiaoqiao was delicate and couldn’t withstand too much stress.
 

 
If things were to be revealed, the Li family would likely help suppress the matter for Qiaoqiao’s sake... As long as Qiaoqiao was with him, he would treat her well, making her understand that his past with Mu Yingchen was merely a mistake. Besides, the life-exchanging gu he used on Yingchen was also for her sake, right? He was trying to secure a complete future for the two of them.
 

 
With this thought, Shao Xuanzheng felt a sense of calm.
 

 
...
 

 
The couple ceremony was approaching.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng invited everyone he could, including the main branch of the Shao family and cultivators from the South China Sword Sect. Given the prominence of the bride's family, there were even more esteemed guests this time, making the ceremony far more grand and spectacular compared to the one held with the grassroots cultivator Mu Yingchen years ago.
 

 
News spread quickly, and some cultivators who disapproved of Shao Xuanzheng began to gossip. Since Mu Yingchen had gone missing, there had been no word of her; it seemed too quick for him to engage in dual cultivation with someone else, especially with a childhood sweetheart. Who would believe there wasn't something shady going on?
 

 
Supporters of Shao Xuanzheng pointed out that he had invested considerable time and resources in searching for Yingchen, making it clear that his feelings were genuine.
 

 
The critics scoffed, muttering in frustration—
 

 
"Maybe Shao Xuanzheng is just eager to find someone to silence?"
 

 
Regardless of their thoughts, on the day of the couple ceremony, everyone wore smiles.
 

 
The North Qing Sect did not reply, and given their previous comments, Shao Xuanzheng guessed they were too embarrassed to attend. That was fine; even if that woman managed to break the poison curse, she wouldn’t dare cause trouble on his territory alone. Her future would likely involve running away, while he would gain the support of the Li family, paving a smooth path for his cultivation!
 

 
Seeing the smiling faces in the audience, Shao Xuanzheng felt a rush of satisfaction.
 

 
This felt different from the joy he experienced during his first couple ceremony.
 

 
Back then, it was Mu Yingchen's unparalleled beauty that brought him prestige, but few notable figures came to congratulate him. It was already a feat that gifts were sent on behalf of the Shao family, all because Yingchen lacked an impressive family background.
 

 
Today, however, many prominent figures from the South China Sword Sect were in attendance.
 

 
So what if there were private discussions about his relationship with Yingchen?
 

 
In front of him, everyone wore smiles.
 

 
This was the thrill of power and fame!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng remembered how Mu Yingchen used to tell him to focus on cultivation and avoid unnecessary socializing. When it really mattered, no one stepped up to speak for her, simply because she didn’t know how to manage relationships.
 

 
Unlike the vibrant, festive halls of ordinary weddings, the couple ceremony emphasized elegance and purity. Immortal lanterns floated in the air, each arrayed with formations that harnessed the spiritual energy within, creating a dreamlike atmosphere in the grand hall.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao wore a bright red bridal gown, her cheeks flushed.
 

 
She stood beside Shao Xuanzheng, smiling shyly.
 

 
Due to her frail health, this pampered young lady of the Li family seldom showed her face in public. Today, seeing her, people couldn't help but praise her: she was even more impressive in person, a true beauty worthy of the Li family, though her inherent heart condition was regrettable.
 

 
A seasoned onlooker whispered, "If we’re talking about beauty, Mu Yingchen is in a league of her own."
 

 
"You've seen her?"
 

 
Mu Yingchen also rarely appeared in public.
 

 
Her health was robust, and she was quite strong.
 

 
It was said that when she was at the North Qing Sect, she could take on ten opponents easily, although she had a tendency to seclude herself for cultivation. Since the North Qing Sect was located in a frigid region, even flying on a sword required extra spells, or one would suffer the harsh winds. Thus, very few present had ever seen Mu Yingchen.
 

 
"I saw her at the last couple ceremony," the gossiping onlooker described the female lead in eight words: "Unparalleled elegance, captivating beauty.”
 

 
“Really? I don’t believe it.”
 

 
“Shh, don’t say that on Yaoxia Fairy’s big day.”
 

 
The murmurs didn’t reach the stage.
 

 
On stage, Shao Xuanzheng was passionately recounting his difficult journey and how he met Yaoxia Fairy: “Love in this world, like the path of cultivation, is fraught with pitfalls. Fortunately, after all the twists and turns, we found each other again, knowing and loving one another.” He looked down lovingly at the one who held his heart: “Heaven has not been unkind to me.”
 

 
Everyone listening understood that the "pitfalls" he referred to were about Mu Yingchen.
 

 
His eagerness to curry favor with the Li family was too obvious.
 

 
However, no one pointed it out.
 

 
Mu Yingchen was too reclusive; the nature of their relationship was solely in Shao Xuanzheng's words. Who would speak for a stranger? Everyone was more concerned with how to network with other cultivators on this joyous day, to become familiar faces in front of powerful figures and gather the latest news.
 

 
Looking at the two standing side by side, they couldn't help but feel a bit envious.
 

 
“I, Shao Xuanzheng, swear before the heavens that in this life and the next…”
 

 
Just as he was about to make an important vow during this auspicious moment, a sharp sword cry pierced the sky, shattering his words. Everyone instinctively held their breath, turning to the source of the sound.
 

 
It was truly a face of unmatched beauty.
 

 
With features seemingly carved from pristine white snow, she gazed coldly at the stage.
 

 
Her bright eyes shimmered with a faint golden light, characteristic of a peak Golden Core cultivator.
 

 
Easily breaking through layers of formations, she landed in a flowing white robe…
 

 
“See, I wasn’t wrong,” the audacious onlooker whispered, “Yingchen Fairy is way more beautiful than her.”
 

 
The guests couldn't help but murmur among themselves.
 

 
They hadn't heard that Shao Xuanzheng's ex-wife had such high cultivation!
 

 
So why was she here today?
 

 
To cause trouble?
 

 
Aside from those with vested interests, the other invited guests, regardless of their status, transformed into onlookers, secretly hoping for some exciting developments. It had been too dull in the cultivation world; a bit of excitement was rare. If a fight broke out, it would be the talk of the day!
 

 
“On this joyous day for Master Xuanzheng, I apologize for my tardiness.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice rang clearly throughout the hall with a hint of enchantment.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng’s expression darkened, but he was prepared. He retorted, “Yingchen, I have already granted you your freedom. Why have you come today?”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao tightened her grip on his arm, furrowing her delicate brows, and quietly asked him what was going on.
 

 
While calming her, Shao Xuanzheng pulled out a response he had prepared: “Yingchen and I were not compatible. After one argument, we decided to part ways. When she disappeared from the estate that day, I searched everywhere for her… Yingchen, you say our severing of ties was just a moment of anger, but it truly broke my heart. Some words, like spilled water, can never be taken back!”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond immediately, only coldly staring at him.
 

 
Seeing the golden glint in her eyes, he felt a pang of fear.
 

 
What method had this woman used to advance her cultivation instead of regressing? He had clearly shattered her Golden Core while she was poisoned! It was impossible; such a demonic technique couldn't exist… However, with her so splendidly appearing before everyone, he couldn't claim to have treated her poorly!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was not afraid of her causing trouble.
 

 
Today, he had invited his senior brothers and sisters from the South China Sword Sect.
 

 
How could one sword compete against so many?
 

 
He also knew that his ex-wife was not good with words.
 

 
…
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng's guess was correct.
 

 
Whether it was Mu Yingchen's character or the subconscious of Master Lu, neither were inclined to defend themselves; they often found it too tiresome to explain.
 

 
“Shao Xuanzheng, this is a matter for us to resolve,”
 

 
Tong Zhao said, placing her hand on the sword hilt and gently drawing it out.
 

 
A cold light flashed, and the corner of her sleeve billowed in the rising wind.
 

 
“Mu requests a duel!”
 

 
…What the!
 

 
This woman was completely unreasonable!
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng hadn't expected her to go this crazy, so he quickly formed a seal to summon his sword.
 

 
He managed to summon it just in time, preparing to block her attack when a massive wave surged from the side, knocking him and Li Qiaoqiao over, sending them tumbling through the air before crashing down.
 

 
“You actually brought helpers to ambush me!”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng roared in anger, turning to glare at the one who had attacked him, only to find it was his senior brother.
 

 
He was stunned.
 

 
Then, he watched as the high platform he had been standing on split apart down the middle.
 

 
That wasn’t just an ordinary platform; it was made from extremely cold glacial rock that he had purchased at a high price beforehand. Its purity and hardness symbolized steadfastness and good fortune.
 

 
The platform made of glacial rock had been split in two by his ex-wife’s sword.
 

 
Was that the strike he had just tried to block?
 

 
If it weren't for his senior brother’s intervention, he would have been the one sliced in half.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt both anger and fear.
 

 
“Mu Yingchen, I intended to treat you with courtesy out of respect for our past as partners, but I didn’t expect you to be so brutal and unreasonable,” he said, clasping his fists. “I earnestly ask the masters of the South China Sword Sect to help me seek justice!”
 

 
The shattered glacial platform filled the once joyous hall with swirling smoke.
 

 
“Partners? Justice?”
 

 
Tong Zhao stood amidst the mist, holding her snow-white sword, her expression unwavering.
 

 
She curved her lips into a stunning smile, captivating even the disciples of the South China Sword Sect, who were naturally on the male side.
 

 
“Shao thief, you poisoned me to seal my powers, shattered my golden core while I was weak, used a life-exchange curse on me, and imprisoned me in a water prison to take my life. Did you ever consider the bonds of partnership? Did you ever think of giving me justice?”
 

 
Her voice rang out, commanding the attention of the guests.
 

 
Yet, it lacked convincing power…
 

 
“What a joke!” Shao Xuanzheng retorted, righteous indignation in his tone. “If I really shattered your golden core, how could you have performed that sword strike just now? Moreover, your words carry neither resentment nor hatred; it seems you have wronged me, and your act doesn’t even look convincing!”
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
The crowd turned to look at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Her face, strikingly beautiful, displayed no joy or sorrow, colder than the sword in her hand.
 

 
Could anyone truly remain unshaken after being treated like that by their husband?
 

 
As the crowd pondered this, Tong Zhao raised her hand to her chest, seemingly disregarding her clothing, and reached for her heart.
 

 
This gesture was even more shocking to the guests than her earlier words.
 

 
Unimpeded by anything, this was the kind of power only a semi-immortal could possess.
 

 
Before everyone’s eyes, Tong Zhao extracted an ugly cursed insect from her heart, suppressed by spiritual power. Accompanied by a wave of her hand, a larger mother insect flew from Li Qiaoqiao’s heart into her grasp.
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao coughed up a mouthful of blood.
 

 
“No, Mu Yingchen, you can’t do this, stop her…!”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng shouted in alarm.
 

 
But both insects disintegrated into ashes at Tong Zhao’s command.
 

 
The one who used the curse faced backlash, and Shao Xuanzheng fell to the ground, his face pale.
 

 
He hadn’t expected his ex-wife to not only recover her golden core but also significantly advance in power. How had she accomplished this?
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng had intended for his sect to subdue Mu Yingchen first and then find a way to cover up the truth.
 

 
Now, however, the evidence was indisputable, and his brothers dared not intervene.
 

 
“Brother Shao,”
 

 
Li Qiaoqiao pushed him away in disbelief, standing up with the maid’s help. “When did you place a curse on me?”
 

 
“Qiaoqiao, I was worried about your health…”
 

 
“Caring for me doesn’t mean you can exchange my life for Mu Yingchen’s! I don’t need it!”
 

 
Thinking back to her recent, inexplicable recovery, Li Qiaoqiao found it absurd and wanted to laugh. How could it be good? Trading her life for a cultivator at the golden core stage! She couldn’t accept it, covering her face and crying, completely unwilling to hear his explanation, fleeing to the protection of her elders, cutting off Shao Xuanzheng’s hopes of gaining the Li family’s assistance.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was left to face the sword-wielding woman alone.
 

 
His eyes reflected confusion, anger, and fear.
 

 
Just like the day when her golden core was shattered after being poisoned.
 

 
At that time, he had looked at his wife with satisfaction, his mind filled with thoughts of ascending, gaining wealth, and replacing her.
 

 
But now, as his ex-wife looked at him, there was not even a hint of pleasure in revenge.
 

 
Cold and detached.
 

 
"You must be curious why my cultivation has improved so rapidly,"
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke slowly, her voice as sharp as a sword's cry. Although her tone was melodious, it sent shivers through the hearts of the guests, and those with lower cultivation began to circulate their spiritual energy to protect their minds. "My golden core was shattered, and my remaining spiritual power was minimal. Today was supposed to be the day of my death due to the life-exchanging curse."
 

 
"Do you remember the Emotionless Venerable?"
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng instinctively responded, "That was your master."
 

 
"Before her ascension, she said she would leave the Emotionless Sword for me."
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng recalled this: "But she didn't!"
 

 
"Right, because you wanted to cultivate the Emotionless Sword with me," Tong Zhao seemed to recall some humorous yet tragic memory, revealing a hint of nostalgia. "I declined my master's good intentions."
 

 
"You found the Emotionless Sword?"
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng felt he was beginning to understand the situation.
 

 
Every ascendant venerable was a powerful being, so it was quite normal for them to leave treasures for their most trusted disciples.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng started to think about how to rally his brothers and sisters to find an excuse to kill and seize treasures, glancing at his senior brother.
 

 
He secretly rejoiced that the people from the North Qing Sect were not present today.
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed to completely ignore his small gesture and continued, "No, my master took the Love-Cutting Sword with her when she ascended."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao continued, "But she left behind a sword furnace that can still be used once, allowing me to offer my heartfelt love to the furnace.”
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng gritted his teeth.
 

 
That master was an old prude who disliked men, and during his pursuit of Mu Yingchen, he had been thwarted by her several times. He never expected that even after ascending, she would still try to make her disciple rid herself of him!
 

 
At this moment, Shao Xuanzheng completely forgot that he held the same thought.
 

 
He showed a face full of humiliation and asked, “So what? Are you going to do the same as your master and kill your husband to prove your path?”
 

 
“Kill the husband to prove the path? Ridiculous.”
 

 
This was something her master had done.
 

 
Even though the victim was a heartless man, it still sounded shocking.
 

 
However, just like in the mundane world, disciples should avoid speaking ill of their masters.
 

 
Anyone could say the master was wrong, but the disciple could not.
 

 
Yet she boldly called it ridiculous?
 

 
Tong Zhao continued:
 

 
“Shao Xuanzheng, you think too highly of yourself. Killing a husband to prove a path is to sever emotional ties—what connection do you and I have? I am here to seek justice for myself, to resolve past grievances, and to clear my own path.”
 

 
“I don’t question why the heavens are unfair to me, nor do I ask why you betrayed me.”
 

 
“From now on, the sword in my hand is my path in my heart,”
 

 
“Those who obstruct me will be punished by the sword!”
 

 
The faces of the disciples from the South Hua Sword Sect changed. They realized she was serious about killing Shao Xuanzheng. If she killed him here, what face would their sect have left? The Shao family wouldn't just stand by; they had invited so many guests today not only for the sake of pride but also with this consideration in mind.
 

 
Layers of pressure descended, trying to deter her actions.
 

 
“Even if Xuanzheng has wronged you, it doesn’t justify killing him outright. Spare his life!”
 

 
She grasped the sword again.
 

 
No fancy moves, no lengthy incantations or gestures.
 

 
What remained was only a pure, fierce, and overwhelming sword intent!
# Chapter57
The oppressive force of various people in the hall was exerted upon Tong Zhao.
 

 
However, that white figure did not waver in the slightest.
 

 
Cold sweat the size of beans dripped down from Shao Xuanzheng's forehead. He firmly believed that his senior brother would save him and not abandon him, so he held on and did not beg for mercy, quietly waiting for his ex-wife to be captured...
 

 
He stared at Tong Zhao, while the director backstage was also focused on the screen.
 

 
"Useless."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu took a puff of his electronic cigarette and shook his head, saying, "If this were a real fantasy world, there would be some reasoning, but this is a movie; the protagonist must be the strongest. Those who oppose her will die."
 

 
Other staff members glanced at each other: "What about the male lead?"
 

 
"I gave him a chance. His trait is being treacherous and malicious. If Shao Xuanzheng hadn't been indulging in the pleasure of kicking his ex-wife in the past few days, and had done more planning or found a way to locate her as soon as he discovered Mu Yingchen had escaped from the water prison... In short, Tong Zhao's subconscious is still far stronger than his. In this competitive film 'Heartless Tribulation', the winner is the protagonist."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pushed off with his toes while sitting in the boss's chair, making the chair spin halfway around. He opened the editing backend of the official page for 'Heartless Tribulation' on his tablet and moved [Chen Zhuzhi] from the protagonist column to the supporting role.
 

 
Only two characters remained in the protagonist column—
 

 
Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pressed confirm to modify, “In the movie, the protagonist can obtain everything.”
 

 
...
 

 
This sword strike was not fast.
 

 
To cultivators, even the usual speed of a sword move appears slow in their eyes, and Tong Zhao's sword strike could be described as leisurely, as if it gave the people from the Sword Sect ample time to stop her. However, when they attempted to stop her, every strike they launched to intercept her failed to even come close.
 

 
In the sword-refining furnace, Fairy Yingchen comprehended her Dao and broke through to the peak of the Golden Core stage.
 

 
Her master had probably long seen that Shao Xuanzheng was no good man. She suspected that her exceptionally gifted disciple might one day realize this and use Shao Xuanzheng as an offering to the furnace.
 

 
But everyone's understanding of the Dao is different.
 

 
What Tong Zhao understood was another matter—
 

 
Lifelong love should be for oneself.
 

 
This concept is often expressed as a cliché, yet very few can truly achieve or comprehend it. Cherishing oneself does not mean being selfish—allowing a disciple to throw themselves into the furnace is also a self-serving act of self-preservation, but Tong Zhao despised doing so; she had her own Dao.
 

 
No sword cultivator is not proud.
 

 
Tong Zhao believed that the sword is the noblest of weapons, and therefore must also possess noble principles.
 

 
When a hundred kinds of weapons charged toward her, they were reduced to powder in an instant.
 

 
The slowness of this sword strike instead gave Shao Xuanzheng enough time to experience the fear and despair of impending death.
 

 
At this moment, she was the butcher, and he was the fish on the chopping block.
 

 
To resolve past entanglements and sever causality, the one who truly possessed a clear path to immortality was her.
 

 
“No... Yingchen, I was wrong...”
 

 
After realizing that no one could save him, Shao Xuanzheng’s true nature was revealed as he frantically pleaded for mercy.
 

 
He was even more horrified to discover that this sword not only cleaved through his physical body but also crushed his soul. The nascent Golden Core, which had just begun to take shape, could not withstand the sharpness, turning into nothingness as well. After the three souls and seven spirits were shattered, they would not enter reincarnation, nor would there be a next life.
 

 
This earth-shattering sword strike flattened the entire great hall.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng completely disappeared.
 

 
Nothing remained.
 
Chen Zhuzhi woke up in the holographic chamber.
 

 
The Shao family was both shocked and enraged, some crushing their tokens to call for reinforcements for revenge. However, at that moment, Qingniang also arrived on the scene with members of the Beiqing Sect and intervened to prevent a bloody battle. The South China Sword Sect, seeing that a person had died completely and that Shao Xuanzheng had made the first mistake, refused to stand up for him, no matter how the Shao family incited them.
 

 
Mu Yingchen's persona is that of a cold and reclusive cultivation fanatic, and she does not have a good reputation within the sect.
 

 
After her master ascended, she left the Extreme Cold Lands and became Dao companions with Shao Xuanzheng. Following his request, she almost cut off all ties with the sect.
 

 
However, her master had paved the way for her.
 

 
As long as she understands herself and strives for her own interests, separating from the bad people and comprehending the Dao of the sword, the sect will have a place for her.
 

 
The Beiqing Sect has mixed feelings about this fellow disciple who has reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. There is anxiety, admiration, nostalgia, and suspicion that she might come to vie for power. Unfortunately, just like her proud and solitary demeanor in white clothing, Tong Zhao inherited only a snow-capped peak from her master and closed the door to solitary cultivation, accompanied by a mortal woman whose timing is too late for entering the cultivation world.
 

 
---
 

 
In the vast land of the Nine Provinces, there are various legends about Mu Yingchen.
 

 
It is said that this Fairy Mu only accepts female disciples.
 

 
No matter how talented or prestigious a male disciple might be, she refuses to meet with them.
 

 
Her direct disciple, like her, remained unmarried for life.
 

 
Before her ascension, Fairy Mu distributed all her treasures equally among the female disciples at the foot of the snow-capped peak. Her direct disciple, Qingniang, received an extra gift: a replica sword forged from extremely rare meteorite iron—the replica of the Snow Name Divine Sword that Fairy Mu carried with her.
 

 
---
 

 
When Tong Zhao opened her eyes in the holographic chamber, Master Lu immediately fled from the position of the host personality.
 

 
Tong Zhao: 【……】
 

 
She ran away too quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood her, after all, someone who is used to the cultivation lifestyle does not enjoy dealing with trivial matters.
 

 
She moved her shoulders a bit and rubbed her buzzing temples.
 

 
Just then, a staff member came over to bring her a hot towel to wipe her face. After wiping her face, she felt much more refreshed.
 

 
Staff Member: "Sister Zhao, you can go rest now."
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" was filmed continuously without any breaks, which placed an even greater mental burden on the actors.
 

 
While the other actors who woke up afterward were still in the chamber and had yet to come to their senses, she was already able to get up and leave. Seeing this, the staff members, who had a deep understanding of the instinctive nature of filming, couldn't help but marvel at how her mind worked—it was truly impressive.
 

 
Tong Zhao stepped out into the corridor; the actor dormitory was one floor up.
 

 
Important roles did not need to share rooms with others and were provided with the best suites.
 

 
As Tong Zhao turned towards the elevator, the door of the holographic filming room, which had a temporary actor nameplate hanging on it, opened from the inside. A beautiful woman in her late twenties with an oval face walked out, locking eyes with her and showing surprise: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan! Can I have your autograph?”
 

 
“I didn’t bring a pen, but can we take a photo together?”
 

 
The beautiful woman nodded enthusiastically, her eyes sparkling with excitement—she was a true fan.
 

 
This temporary actress, named Fu Xiaoheng, felt utterly satisfied after getting a photo with Tong Zhao. When she woke up, she discovered that she was the only one left in the entire extra actors’ room. She also received a text from the staff saying that she performed particularly well and, due to last-minute changes in the plot, her pay would be increased accordingly. She might even have her name listed in the supporting cast section.
 

 
Although she still didn’t know what exactly her role in the plot was, Fu Xiaoheng’s face was filled with joy: “Maybe I had a lot of scenes with you, Sister Zhao! Ah, I won’t take a break; I want to watch the footage right away—wait, but I’m just an extra, so I don’t have the right to watch the footage…”
 

 
Upon saying this, she felt a bit down.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, “If your name is on the supporting cast list, that shouldn’t count as just being an extra, right?”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng explained that they had to wait for the approval process in the backend, and the footage wouldn’t be sent to her dorm room.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out her phone and asked Shi Qianqiu for his opinion. After receiving a response, she said, “Director Shi said I can go to my room to watch it, as long as I don’t take the footage out.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: !!!
 

 
“Really? Won't it cause you any trouble?” She hesitated a bit.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had agreed quite casually, so it probably wasn’t a serious issue.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was so excited that she wanted to hug her, but since they weren’t very familiar, she didn’t dare to do that. Instead, she followed closely beside her, her heart racing with thoughts of writing a lengthy post for social media—What a day! Not only was she promoted from an extra to a named supporting character, but she was also going to watch the footage with the goddess Zhao. Oh my gosh, she wanted to post about it right away!
 

 
Concubine Chen, covering her face with a feather fan, thought: [Can you stop bringing women into your room all the time? It’d be nice to bring a man back for once.]
 

 
Tong Zhao explained, “When I saw her, I felt a sense of familiarity; we probably had scenes together in the film.”
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed correctly.
 

 
The footage sent from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was from the female lead's perspective, and it hadn’t been edited yet, so she didn’t know what the final result would look like. In her mind, everyone gathered on small stools to watch together.
 

 
Although it was the same face, the aura was vastly different.
 

 
So, in the palace of memories, a banner was unfurled, discussing the topic of “who is more handsome, Brother Duan or Master Lu.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Each has their strengths; the grand scenes in xianxia films are more impressive.”
 

 
Female Reporter: “I still prefer the scene where Brother Duan clips the bullets; it’s very tough-guy.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I particularly like the scene where he leaps into the sword furnace; I vote for Master Lu.”
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled, “Master Lu really wields a great sword!”
 

 
Female Reporter: “Pun jokes will cost you.”
 

 
---
 

 
On the other side, Chen Zhuzhi, who had woken up from the capsule much earlier, had already regained most of his memory.
 

 
Although he had been downgraded to a supporting role, the staff didn’t ask him to move out of the suite; he could still stay until the contract with the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew expired. He paced back and forth in his room, feeling anxious, while his manager took two hours to return his call. “Brother Chen, please stop calling me non-stop. I have other artists to manage. When things get busy, I can’t keep up with you. Didn’t you just wake up from the capsule not long ago? You should really be resting now.”
 

 
“Don’t brush me off!”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was annoyed. “Why was my name removed from the lead role section? Listen, the final cut hasn’t come out yet, so there’s still room for negotiation. You need to find a way to pull some strings…”
 

 
After being berated, the manager, feeling a bit displeased, retorted sarcastically, “If you can’t handle your own subconscious, how am I supposed to help you with connections? Why don’t you just ask Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s expression darkened further.
 

 
What he wanted was for his manager to ask Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Last time, because he didn’t want to share money with his ex-girlfriend, Shi Qianqiu had warned him that if he bothered him again, he would find someone to break his legs—he could shamelessly seek help from others, but he truly didn’t dare provoke Shi Qianqiu. This opportunistic manager wasn’t willing to waste any more time on him: “Since you’ve gone from rising to sinking, you might as well settle into being a supporting villain. By the way, if you’re going to be a supporting role in the future, you won’t need your current team; the company will cut down the budget for you, and I’ll assign your assistant to someone else. Just take a break and see if any opportunities come up later.”
 

 
Supporting role!
 

 
After the manager hung up on Chen Zhuzhi, he felt helpless and thought of contacting his ex-girlfriend through Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He called her, appealing to her interests, explaining that he signed a contract, and if he dropped from a lead to a supporting role, his pay would be significantly reduced, which would also lower the compensation he needed to give her.
 

 
His ex-girlfriend laughed, “Director Shi told me that the part you owe me will be directly transferred to my account, no matter how you perform, it won’t affect my share. Did you change your phone number again? I didn’t block this one… Oh well, it doesn’t matter if I block it now. So, you’ve been downgraded from lead to supporting role? That means you didn’t compete with Tong Zhao. Good to know; I’ll buy a ticket to see ‘Heartless Tribulation’ when it comes out. Goodbye!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was certainly not doing charity.
 

 
To have someone with a wicked temperament perform in an instinctive film, he naturally had to bear the relevant risks. He had rich experience dealing with such matters and would never let unrelated issues affect others.
 

 
After all, he needed the subconscious of a villain; he didn’t really like mingling with them.
 

 
This was the second time today that Chen Zhuzhi had his call dropped.
 

 
He slumped on the sofa.
 

 
As long as it wasn’t a serious criminal case involving murder, arson, or strong-arming, instinctive films needed many roles that required a despicable subconscious. However, most of these were supporting roles, and only a very few had the opportunity to be leads. This was because mainstream audiences preferred to see positive, kind-hearted characters.
 

 
Opportunities for villainous leads were fiercely contested.
 

 
The news that he had lost the dual-lead role to Tong Zhao would spread quickly in the industry, effectively closing the door to any future leading roles for him. His subconscious wasn’t remarkable enough; even his villainy was bland and unremarkable. Evil could be charming, but his was not distinct or vivid enough to impress Shi Qianqiu with a compelling narrative. His evil was merely off-putting…
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi covered his face with his hands.
 

 
In his mind, he could hear his manager's scornful mockery, along with his ex-girlfriend's gleeful laughter.
 

 
Then he raised his head, reluctantly and anxiously surveying the exquisite suite.
 

 
The next time he came to the film studio, he would have to share a room with other supporting actors.
 

 
The program team of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had moved Chen Zhuzhi from the lead role section to the supporting role section during the shooting, and keen-eyed fans noticed this and screenshot it, posting it on film forums, sparking a lively discussion.
 

 
Some netizens believed that the dual-lead competitive PK was merely a gimmick—
 

 
[It just increases the workload for post-editing, and is bound to waste one of the actor's performances. Poor Chen Zhuzhi.]
 

 
[What a pity, what’s so tragic about a domestic abuser?]
 

 
[The notorious artist has roles to play thanks to the popularity of instinctive films. Shi Qianqiu’s hiring choices are really cold and merciless. Personally, I’m happy to see Tong Zhao kick him off the lead role; I heard he signed a contract with a betting clause? Dropping to the supporting role means he won’t get any profit shares? Great, I’ll buy a ticket to support!]
 

 
[Rest assured to buy a ticket in support! 1]
 

 
[Am I the only one eagerly looking forward to Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the Fairy Yingchen? And who is this new supporting character, Fu Xiaoheng? Could someone knowledgeable please introduce her?]
 

 
Aside from Tong Zhao, the biggest beneficiary from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was Fu Xiaoheng.
 

 
The crew took new promotional photos of her, placing her fourth in the lineup, right after Ding Jiao.
 

 
Not only did the company improve her treatment, but she also received additional offers for supporting roles.
 

 
Being able to excel as a temporary actor and rise to a supporting role proved that her subconscious was quite expressive.
 

 
The dual-lead competitive filming style of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was very novel, even among instinctive films, and it inherently had a gimmick. With the outcome of this PK, it was delightfully satisfying to see good triumph over evil, which further boosted audience expectations.
 

 
On the pre-sale ranking for viewing rights on online platforms, ‘Heartless Tribulation’ shot straight to first place.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also humorously dubbed the most profitable subconscious.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had stopped speaking in the group chat for the crew, and no one tagged him.
 

 
Ding Jiao privately told Tong Zhao that she suspected Chen Zhuzhi had muted the group.
 

 
And it was probably for the best.
 

 
After all, after the shooting, the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew group chat had instantly turned into Tong Zhao's fan club branch.
 

 
But why was that?
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: “There aren’t many subconscious minds that can handle Brother Shi’s scripts. For this point regarding Sister Zhao, I’m a fan!”
 

 
Modeling Team Guy: “Has Sister Zhao considered becoming a special forces soldier?”
 

 
Props Master: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan!”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “What a coincidence, so am I.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Me too, me too!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was later brought into the group; she didn’t speak much but would always chime in to support Tong Zhao whenever there was a chance to praise her. Originally, Ding Jiao was supposed to have a significant role, but because of Chen Zhuzhi, she ended up becoming a complete supporting character. Fortunately, after Shao Xuanzheng was killed, Li Qiaoqiao stepped up to support Mu Yingchen, which helped her regain some presence.
 

 
Ding Jiao didn’t hold it against Tong Zhao and took this opportunity to build a good relationship with her, hoping for future collaboration opportunities.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse her goodwill.
 

 
In the subsequent promotional efforts for the crew, the friendly interactions among the three female characters further relegated Chen Zhuzhi to the role of a background figure.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was furious about this.
 

 
He didn’t dare to cause trouble, nor did he have the ability to mess with Tong Zhao. What good would it do to make her miserable? If this had happened before filming started, he might have had the chance to scheme against her, but as adults focused on their interests, Chen Zhuzhi wouldn’t act impulsively out of momentary anger.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi shifted his thinking.
 

 
He wanted to create a CP with Tong Zhao to ride her popularity, hoping to turn his luck around.
 

 
In a talk show promoting ‘Heartless Tribulation’, he frequently brought up Tong Zhao, shamelessly trying to win her over—
 

 
—“Ever since I saw Sister Zhao’s debut in ‘The Legend of Emperor Ming’, she has been my favorite actress. I was so happy to know I could work with her that I couldn’t sleep well for three days. I even worried I might actually fall asleep when lying in the holographic chamber.”
 

 
—“My ideal type is Tong Zhao.”
 

 
—“Honestly, it’s normal that I didn’t perform well in the role of Shao Xuanzheng… If it weren’t for the plot, there’s no way I’d break up with such a beautiful wife like Mu Yingchen. I’d hold onto Fairy Yingchen’s thigh and never let go!”
 

 
He looked quite presentable, which was very deceptive.
 

 
Unfortunately, Tong Zhao wasn’t falling for it.
 

 
—“I don’t use Weibo much and rarely watch entertainment news. The first time I heard about you, it was on the front page of a social news article.”
 

 
She directly poked at his history with his abusive ex-girlfriend.
 

 
—“Really? I’m considering a transformation starting today.”
 

 
When he said the last line, the program’s cameras immediately zoomed in on Tong Zhao, who wore a slightly aloof but strikingly beautiful face, clearly showing her disdain. This delighted the director of the talk show, who saw a perfect explosive moment right in front of him—who wouldn’t be happy?
 

 
In the entertainment industry, where everything is usually glossed over, it’s rare for faces to be openly torn apart.
 

 
There were instances in the past, but they have become quite scarce recently.
 

 
Disagreements usually exist between fan groups, while stars greet each other with smiles, leaving no room for leaks.
 

 
There’s only a fine line between being genuine and lacking emotional intelligence.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao showed no intention of picking up the conversation, Chen Zhuzhi felt anxious but also thought that one shouldn’t hit those who smile. He hadn’t offended Tong Zhao, and there was no need for her to deal with him, so he wanted to be extra attentive to her in any encounters they might have—
 

 
However, there were no opportunities at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s agent was much more capable than his.
 

 
What about bribing paparazzi to capture suggestive angles?
 

 
Sister Chu instructed Tong Zhao’s two female assistants to guard her closely, not giving him any chance to approach.
 

 
Afterward, for that episode of the talk show, Sister Chu used her connections and influence to eliminate any possibility of editing it to make it seem like there was mutual interest.
 

 
Sister Chu comforted her: “Don’t worry; Chen Zhuzhi is just a cornered dog. He won’t have many opportunities to appear in front of you again. The only chance he might have to gain some popularity is by creating a CP with you, but he knows he doesn’t deserve it... unless you go crazy and fall in love with him.”
 

 
That possibility was extremely slim; Sister Chu knew her artist was completely focused on her career.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with an “mm.”
 

 
It was impossible for her to go crazy and fall in love with Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
However, while filming the show, Lu Xianchang really wanted to split him in half with a sword.
 

 
And the effect of the show’s airing was that Chen Zhuzhi kept awkwardly calling out to Tong Zhao as if he were acting strangely.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi did have some fans.
 

 
Those who knew he had an abusive ex-girlfriend yet still remained loyal to him were, one can imagine, a particular type. Not only were they not deterred by his desperate behavior, but they also targeted Tong Zhao in the comments and bullet screens.
 

 
[Chen Zhuzhi is still a senior; does Tong Zhao really need to be this rude?]
 

 
[Brother Zhu didn’t really confess to her; he just expressed admiration for a talented junior. Her reaction was too ugly.]
 

 
[Not a fan of anyone, but because of this attitude toward Tong Zhao in the promotion, I’m turning against her.]
 

 
However, the eyes of the crowd were sharp.
 

 
Just as they had begun to forget Chen Zhuzhi’s past misdeeds, Tong Zhao’s comment about the social news reminded them again.
 

 
Right, he’s a legal-themed celebrity!
 

 
Netizens helped to mock him back, while Tong Zhao’s fans had always been more laid-back...
 

 
Up until “The Sea King’s Kill.”
 

 
After “The Sea King’s Kill” aired, a special group emerged among Tong Zhao’s fans, not large in number but strong in combat power: the girlfriend fans of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were irrational and unreasonable, and Tong Zhao’s fans initially didn’t plan to pay them any attention. However, after several days of not seeing normal content and being bothered, some of the more sensitive fans even considered unfollowing her.
 

 
The so-called only magic can defeat magic came into play at that moment, as Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans rallied to protect their idol—
 

 
[Stop pretending to be bystanders; who besides the little punching bags would speak for the legal celebrity?]
 

 
[So heartbroken for her, being forced to promote alongside a scumbag.]
 

 
[Ew, could the legal-themed celebrity keep their distance from our sister? Be careful, or she might send your brother to the afterlife with a punch.]
 

 
Not only did they fight back, but they also provided various well-organized pieces of evidence against Chen Zhuzhi, proving his past wrongdoings.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were left dumbfounded.
 

 
This wasn’t right. In the past, whenever they targeted female celebrities’ fans, besides the occasional ridicule from bystanders, they never encountered any real opponents. Why did they hit a wall this time? The arguments sounded so familiar, almost like those from other male celebrities' fan wars.
 

 
Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans didn’t waste time arguing with them; they chased after Chen Zhuzhi for two days, and once they confirmed that his fans wouldn’t dare to fight back, they returned victorious.
 

 
Only confused Chen fans and onlookers were left behind.

# Chapter58
An analysis post suddenly appeared on a forum, and within half an hour, it became a hot topic.
 

 
Two hours later, the moderator highlighted it, showing just how exciting it was.
 

 
The poster was a new media writer who usually earned a living writing articles about mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts, bizarre matchmaking stories, workplace troubles, and similar topics. Occasionally, they would also post fabricated stories on various forums to drive traffic to their public account—essentially using sensational content to “entice” netizens to follow the thread, and when they couldn’t get enough, they would end with a tease: “To know more, please follow xxxxxx.”
 

 
There’s expertise in every field, and regardless of quality, writers of this kind know how to grab attention right from the start.
 

 
Moreover, this time, the information being revealed was genuine.
 

 
The poster first provided a brief summary of the background.
 

 
The gist of this story was straightforward, even for netizens who didn’t follow the entertainment industry.
 

 
It involved the fans of the female lead and the original male lead of the upcoming film ‘ Heartless Tribulation’, set to release next month, getting into a heated argument.
 

 
[Huh? Why are the male and female leads’ fans fighting? Is it over their roles?]
 

 
[What do you mean by “original male lead”?]
 

 
[It means that in ‘The Heartless Tribulation’, Tong Zhao kicked Chen Zhuzhi out of the main lead position.]
 

 
Thanks to the enthusiastic explanations from fans of instinctive films, bystanders quickly understood the situation.
 

 
Fair competition.
 

 
It was entirely normal for the subconscious not to perform well and to be outdone by others.
 

 
Since he signed a gambling contract, he should accept the outcome.
 

 
The poster then shared an edited clip from Chen Zhuzhi's promotional program, which heavily implied his desperation. If The female lead politely accepted the situation, even without explicitly reciprocating any feelings, she would likely end up being marketed as a sugar couple (CP) by the marketing team behind Chen Zhuzhi. He would effectively ride on the female lead's popularity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao almost carved the word "disdain" on her forehead.
 

 
The effort to create a CP (couple) turned into a one-sided attachment.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were not having it, and they began to act sarcastic across various forums and Weibo, staging a virtual Three Kingdoms battle—
 

 
Chen Fans (Loyal): "Brother is just kindly taking care of the junior, worried that Tong Zhao wouldn’t get enough screen time, so he mentioned her more. Who would have thought she would turn around and bite him? How about a little politeness from the junior?"
 

 
Chen Fans (Neutral): "Just two sides of fans enjoying the show, they didn’t see the male lead's desperation, only that Tong Zhao’s emotional intelligence is quite low."
 

 
Chen Fans (Opposition): "Chen is only fit to be our Zhao Zhao goddess's lapdog/laughs / laughs."
 

 
Loyalty masquerading as opposition, counter-fans, and fake bystanders...
 

 
A variety of advanced tactics that would leave even seasoned players in the Three Kingdoms game in awe kept emerging. Combined with their aggressive tactics in the forums, they had previously managed to provoke Tong Zhao’s generally passive fans to the point where they had no temper left to fight back—
 

 
Since she wasn't following the typical idol path, her management focused more energy and marketing budget on securing mid to high-end endorsements for her. As long as there weren’t any major issues, they basically ignored the data; as long as she was doing well, it was fine. After all, among her peers, Tong Zhao was already far ahead, and the general audience showed interest in her name in film and television works.
 

 
Netizens following the posts at the top floor marveled at the spectacle.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was definitely not a top-tier actor among male actors.
 

 
He had been in the industry for a while, benefiting from the large population in China, where a smaller base was easier to manipulate. Moreover—
 

 
‘If I can't beat the fans of other male stars, how could I possibly lose to the fans of a female actor?’
 

 
This current state of affairs left netizens feeling a mix of pity and amusement.
 

 
[Why can't he win? Tong Zhao's recent works have been quite popular.]
 

 
Poster: "The law of the internet is that the more brainless you are, the more advantageous it becomes.”
 

 
Poster: "Actually, it's not just the fan community or the internet. Throughout history, countless civilizations have been trampled and destroyed by barbaric forces because barbarism often gives rise to greater military capabilities (of course, this has become rare since the nuclear era), but this phenomenon still occurs frequently online."
 

 
[66666]
 

 
[The poster is quite the cultured person. If you don’t have your big work at the next book fair, I’m not going.]
 

 
[It's not that fans are born brainless; it's that the toxic teams behind the stars find ways to nurture these mindless behaviors. Essentially, they are just legal large-scale multi-level marketing teams, which is unsolvable.]
 

 
Compared to smart people, it's much easier to make money off foolish ones.
 

 
Cutting leeks (a term for profiting off fans) from fans is just making money; there's nothing shameful about it.
 

 
Poster: "Chen Zhuzhi's fans had a good strategy; at first, Tong Zhao's fans indeed couldn’t compete."
 

 
Poster: "But they overlooked one point—"
 

 
Immediately after, the poster shared several screenshots.
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans were also pretty laid-back since there was no ranking to fight for.
 

 
Not long after ‘Sea King Kill’ aired, the perfume endorsement ad came out, and fans were just enjoying the visuals and boosting sales as their daily task. However, the fans of Chen Zhuzhi were running into trouble.
 

 
This official fan account was purely grassroots, and the head was a hot-tempered rich girl.
 

 
Ever since she started following Han Zhi, she put down her keyboard and was forced to adopt a more laid-back approach to fan culture, searching daily for her brother's name and chatting with her friends.
 

 
As a result, she stumbled upon the insults from Chen Zhuzhi's fans.
 

 
The head of the fan group understood the origin of the situation and, confirming it wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, immediately jumped in.
 

 
First screenshot:
 

 
@Han Zhi’s Fan Club: "Are you still cursing?"
 

 
[Han Zhi’s Plaza Screenshot.JPG]
 

 
The second screenshot showed that Chen Zhuzhi's fans had been counter-attacked for two days; no matter where they appeared in related trending news, they were immediately ridiculed to the point of being unrecognizable. The previous tactics of pretending to be neutral and incognito had all been exposed by Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans, with a clear chain of evidence and straightforward posters, making it easy to understand and direct, swiftly confusing the originally dominant male fans.
 

 
The attitudes of Han Zhi’s fans could be categorized into two types.
 

 
1:
 

 
Don’t think that Tong Zhao has no one; they’re all supporting her.
 

 
2:
 

 
Your brother’s desperate attempts to ride the wave of popularity are all too obvious. My side refuses to be tied down; for every time he tries to cling on, we’ll strike back.
 

 
The fan community has evidently developed into its own distinct system, with its own ecology and rules.
 

 
Onlookers were baffled, not understanding why Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were silenced so quickly.
 

 
The leader of Han Zhi’s fan group was a seasoned fangirl, aware that when engaging in battles, you have to hit the opponent where it hurts. Essentially, this was a display of force that inadvertently intimidated potential competitors.
 

 
After the poster provided some commentary, they concluded with a theatrical phrase:
 

 
[Perhaps the best way to maintain peace is for everyone to be armed.]
 

 
[Only magic can defeat magic. Through this example, we get a glimpse of a fan community rivalry. It’s worth pondering: what would happen if any non-idol actor were in the same situation?]
 

 
After being shared, netizens humorously referred to this as a perfect essay.
 

 
Not only did it pinpoint the central theme, but it also elevated the content.
 

 
……
 

 
“Reflecting on fan culture: Counting Chen Zhuzhi's seven deadly sins.”
 

 
“The truth behind the Tong Zhao and Chen Zhuzhi fan war— the desperate struggle of a washed-up celebrity.”
 

 
“In an era of instinctive filmmaking where skill cannot be enhanced through effort, has the dominance of the subconscious effectively stifled this industry...? Wow, this article seems quite favorable to Chen Zhuzhi but has a rather unique angle. However, the topic of instinctive filmmaking being unrelated to acting has been thoroughly discussed. Times change like this; we cannot alter the era, only adapt to it.”
 

 
Manager Chu loudly read three pieces of news.
 

 
What is Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
She’s intensely replying to messages on WeChat.
 

 
Perhaps due to having traversed many worlds, Tong Zhao is quite resilient to loneliness. Compared to her peers, she is a rare breed that doesn’t easily bow down. However, every time she finishes a gig or wraps up a film, her WeChat contacts grow longer…
 

 
She can ignore the guys, but she must reply to the girls to some extent.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao engrossed in her phone, Manager Chu, feeling a bit lonely, asked her, “We just won a brilliant victory. Aren’t you going to go over the details?”
 

 
“You handle it,” Tong Zhao replied, looking up and giving her a smile with her stunningly attractive face, “I trust you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Manager Chu thought to herself, “Trust you, my foot!”
 

 
She’s just too carefree. In the first couple of days, she was mercilessly attacked by Chen Zhuzhi’s fans, and her private messages were filled with bloody, disgusting images. Yet she didn’t waver even slightly and seemed to be having fun, casually downloading two particularly horrifying images to send to Wei Zekai. In the end, her manager dealt with everything.
 

 
Of course, the company wasn’t just idly sitting by.
 

 
That post was crafted by a skilled professional that manager Chu hired, along with a series of paid articles.
 

 
Even if Chen Zhuzhi’s fans didn’t confront Han Zhi’s fans directly, the company had long been prepared to fight back and debunk rumors. This time, the counterattack was executed perfectly, and Tong Zhao’s manager shifted from being the main attacker to providing support. Not only did they play their cards well, but when the other side misplayed, they struck back and declared, “I heard Zanchao Entertainment has already given up on Chen Zhuzhi and left him to fend for himself.”
 

 
“Sounds good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded in appreciation.
 

 
How could she maintain a lofty attitude while being in the industry?
 

 
At the very least, she needed to know how to protect herself. She wouldn’t actively suppress others through underhanded tactics, but she didn’t want anyone to provoke her either.
 

 
Honestly, being protected by her female fans felt quite nice.
 

 
The issue with Chen Zhuzhi's fans came to a conclusion, and there was no possibility of the two collaborating again.
 

 
“Let’s not talk about this unfortunate matter anymore,” manager Chu perked up. “How are you considering the invitation to the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had already been looking into the arrangements for the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala.
 

 
They had invited her to perform on stage.
 

 
Litchi TV is a major platform. Although Tong Zhao was popular, she was still a rising star, and it was unlikely they would give her a solo performance at such an important event. They had invited Song Wanzhuo as well, thinking of creating some buzz with a couple’s act, singing a traditional duet. The specific song hadn’t been finalized yet, but the male side had no objections; they were just waiting for her input. Tong Zhao chatted with Song Wanzhuo on WeChat for a while and felt quite comfortable about it, seeing it as a chance to give a little treat to the ancient couple’s fans.
 

 
What she said was: “It’s a pity we don’t have couple vibes.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied: “That’s hard to say; sometimes I feel a strong connection, and other times I think of you as my buddy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about it and figured that Song Wanzhuo probably only liked her portrayal as Concubine Chen.
 

 
This was normal.
 

 
“Liking all sides of you” is a type of filter; in reality, most people’s affection for someone usually stems from a specific trait, which then expands to a broader understanding—like how Song Wanzhuo was captivated by Concubine Chen’s multifaceted charm, leaving a lasting impression that was hard to forget. Ordinary people often grapple with thoughts like “Does he really like me, or just the version of me that’s XXX?” So, it was even more complicated for someone as multifaceted as Tong Zhao.
 

 
Both Tong Zhao and her manager didn’t want to miss this opportunity to appear.
 

 
Singing alongside Song Wanzhuo was considered a strong collaboration, so they tentatively agreed.
 

 
Manager Chu asked, “Do you want me to find you a teacher?”
 

 
She was worried that Tong Zhao might not know how to sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied that it wasn’t necessary; she could sing.
 

 
She didn’t sing much herself, but she had sung a lot out of boredom in ancient times.
 

 
After all, she had to serve others with her talents, and she was skilled in singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments: “I can play the piece; I can also handle the accompaniment.”
 

 
Manager Chu glanced at her.
 

 
She understood her competitive nature too well; once she stepped on stage, she aimed to do her best. Though she acted nonchalant, in reality, she was determined to steal the show and wouldn’t miss any opportunity to shine. Such an artist was just…
 

 
So easy to manage!
 

 
“Okay, I’ll communicate with the director.”
 

 
Manager Chu was satisfied.
 

 
The music director of Litchi TV approved the request, and the final song was set to be a duet of “A Smile Captivates the Heart,” with her playing the accompaniment. Song Wanzhuo’s manager initially had some concerns, feeling it would overshadow the male lead, and that it would be fairer if they all sang together. However, Song Wanzhuo had a strong opinion and influence in the company; he wanted to see his goddess play the guzheng. What was wrong with letting her take some of the spotlight? Men shouldn’t be so petty.
 

 
Once this was settled, the news was released.
 

 
Originally, the hottest news surrounding Tong Zhao was the completion of "Heartless Tribulation" and her feud with Chen Zhuzhi, but when the public saw the guest list for Litchi TV's New Year’s Gala, they thought, “Oh wow, Tong Zhao is going to be there, and she’ll be singing with Song Wanzhuo!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's reputation and accomplishments far surpassed those of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
The latter’s fans didn’t dare to provoke him.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo posted a very formal Weibo thanking for the collaboration opportunity and tagged the official account of “The Legend of Ming Emperor.” Fans recalled that this was one of his important works, and many new fans had come from that drama. They were simply happy for him to see the Ming Emperor and his concubine on stage together for New Year’s.
 

 
[Supporting the joint performance, will you wear formal wear that day? Why not just wear the costumes from the drama?]
 

 
[Thanks to Litchi TV for the invitation; we’ll see you on New Year’s, big brother!]
 

 
[Seeing through my brother's restrained joy/dog emoji]
 

 
[What? The Song-Zhao couple is resurrecting and giving us sweetness?]
 

 
The fourth comment was relatively discordant.
 

 
The super topic for this ancient couple had long been neglected; no one managed it anymore, and only drama fans occasionally mentioned it.
 

 
When "Sea King Kill" premiered, Song Wanzhuo made sure his fans knew about his admiration for Tong Zhao. His direct and playful way of fandom brought some outside heat and goodwill from bystanders. Fans politely clarified things, and after realizing there were no further ambiguous signs between the two, they felt reassured.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were incredibly frustrated.
 

 
After being mocked a few times and not seeing any chance for a comeback, they scattered like monkeys when the tree fell, all jumping ship.
 

 
This series of discussions brought some heat to "Heartless Tribulation," allowing this big female lead fantasy film to enter the public's view, ranking first in the most anticipated releases list by a significant margin.
 

 
In the era of instinctive cinema, films are made quickly and released even faster.
 

 
Bad movies can result in huge losses, while the winners take it all.
 

 
#Movie "Heartless Tribulation" Premiere#
 

 
#Tong Zhao#
 

 
#Shi Qianqiu#
 

 
How high are the audience’s expectations for this movie?
 

 
From the day "Heartless Tribulation" was released, the number of visitors to the holographic mall clearly reflected this.
 

 
Although it was a weekend holiday, the data flow from netizens clearly indicated one thing — they were going to watch the movie, and it was Tong Zhao's "Heartless Tribulation."
 

 
The advantage of holographic viewing is that you can still get tickets even when the crowd is huge.
 

 
However, the rooms set up by streamers to chat with fans during the viewing do have a limit on the number of participants. Even small streamers can attract a lot of netizens when they tag "Heartless Tribulation," which is a clear indication of how popular this movie is.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi has been relegated to a supporting role.
 

 
It’s obvious who attracts the public and who carries the box office.
 

 
At the offline premiere of "Heartless Tribulation," Tong Zhao wore a pearl-white evening gown, the skirt adorned with layers of scattered diamonds. Her manager repeatedly reminded her that the team had invested heavily in this dress, and her presence had to live up to their efforts:
 

 
“We don’t intend to give Chen Zhuzhi any face; tonight, you are the absolute star.”
 

 
“I know you have a good relationship with the other two female supporting roles, but you must outshine everyone tonight.”
 

 
Tong Zhao fully understood.
 

 
She initially planned to attend alone, but after hearing that the character Concubine Chen could steal the show, she eagerly requested to take the lead role for a while. Tong Zhao readily agreed, as they shared success and would face challenges together.
 

 
A female reporter teased her: "A movie starring Lu Xianzhang lets you steal the spotlight?"
 

 
Concubine Chen replied: "I work the fields while the horse eats grain; if the other side makes money, I enjoy the benefits. There's no shame in that."
 

 
Since recovering her memories from "Heartless Tribulation," Lu Xianzhang seemed to have new insights and had been secluded, so she naturally did not come out to confront concubine Chen at this moment.
 

 
To withstand the grandeur of the event, Tong Zhao’s makeup and hairstyle today were particularly elaborate.
 

 
The dress was tightly fitted at the waist, accentuating her graceful curves.
 

 
The makeup artist applied highlighter to her body, making her a luxury item that was expensive, beautiful, and of high taste —
 

 
Stepping out of the car with the aura of "outshining the crowd," she descended from the ceremonial vehicle.
 

 
Countless flashbulbs lit up concubine Chen, as if she had been washed by a rain of light. Long cameras and short ones aimed at her face, wanting to capture her most authentic side. Unscrupulous media outlets aimed to photograph her less flattering angles, knowing that flawed photos are often more eye-catching.
 

 
However, there was nothing to capture.
 

 
Even in rapid-fire snapshots, no flaws could be detected.
 

 
In this crowded and scrutinized occasion, concubine Chen recalled the grand ceremony where she was conferred as a noble consort, with countless ladies bowing deeply to her. She lazily swept her gaze over their bowed heads, feeling a swell of power and a hint of bored indifference…
 

 
This surplus of confidence elevated concubine Chen's radiant makeup, making all the precious jewels adorning her simply embellishments to her beauty; no matter how large or dazzling the gems, they could not overshadow her brilliance.
 

 
Concubine Chen had only one thought —
 

 
Why didn’t these people kneel down while taking her picture?
 

 
……
 

 
The aura of the noble consort was overwhelming; whether it was the front-line stand-ins, media reporters, or simply the lucky audience members who received premiere invitations, every candid shot that circulated online was stunning.
 

 
[So beautiful, wow! Let me appreciate the empress's beauty.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's looks are truly exceptional. I actually think Chen Zhuzhi might not just be trying to ride on her fame; he genuinely likes her. Who can resist a beautiful woman?]
 

 
[Demon monsters, please leave! Can we stop mentioning that person?]
 

 
While anxiously waiting for the "Confirm Viewing" button to change from gray to green, netizens could only refresh various news related to the premiere, resulting in wave after wave of Tong Zhao's event photos.
 

 
Of course, she was undeniably the first female lead.
 

 
But "Heartless Tribulation" didn't just have her in it; they had to give others some screen time too, right?
 

 
Just as netizens were calling for more photos of others, pictures of Tong Zhao alongside her co-stars were released.
 

 
Uh...
 

 
[Is this a photo of a big star with a regular beauty?]
 

 
[What happened to Jiao Jiao? Ugh, the stylist should be punished!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s dress can’t be cheap; her team is really impressive.]
 

 
It’s not just about the evening gown.
 

 
If it were Tong Zhao, she might consider letting her girlfriends shine together and look beautiful in group photos, but who is concubine Chen? She’s not anti-female nor targeting the same sex; she equally looks down on everyone. She wants to outshine the crowd and make sure the emperor sees only her!
 

 
Concubine Chen never threatens the other consorts to appear barefaced.
 

 
Nor does she fear them sending the emperor secret glances.
 

 
Because with her present, it’s useless for the other consorts to dress up like golden statues.
 

 
The aura effect that the system can extract is beyond comparison.
 

 
In short, the outcome of that group photo was nothing short of disastrous.
 

 
In modern society, there are no emperors, and at the premiere, there isn't a very important domineering CEO that concubine Chen needs to flatter and please. The concubine doesn’t know what it means to know when to back off. Her presence was felt throughout the event, and every male guest attending the premiere was captivated by her charm.
 

 
Wasn't the agent telling Tong Zhao to perform well and outshine everyone?
 

 
Well, what she did was a perfect score. No thanks needed; just kneel in admiration.
 

 
Before the screening began, concubine Chen, satisfied, went to rest, while Tong Zhao sat down in her pre-arranged seat and rubbed her forehead.
 

 
Brother Duan: "Zhao Zhao, were you asleep just now? I suggest you check your WeChat."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, let the concubine handle the socializing for me. What’s up?"
 

 
Brother Duan: "Uh... you’ll know when you see it."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the big screen.
 

 
She realized the movie hadn't started yet, so she took out her phone from her handbag and opened WeChat.
 

 
She discovered that there was a new category added in her contacts—
 

 
Fish Pond:
 

 
- Director of Litchi Entertainment
 
- Music Director of North China
 
- Executive of Yunsanglong Culture
 
- ...
 

 
The list was astonishingly long.
 

 
It was hard to imagine how so many people could be added in such a short time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Concubine, let’s talk."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "They’re all fools who would give up their entire fortune just to see me smile a couple of times. I’ll keep them around; they’re useful. Don’t worry, I’m very good at managing personal space. No one will try to pull any hidden rules on you; their admiration will only stay at the level of appreciation and adoration. They all wanted to add me themselves."
 

 
Hearing this, it was clear she was an old pro at this game.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Hiss.”
 

 
If her life were a stock trading novel, readers would probably have no idea whose stocks to buy.
 

 
She could only indulge her own personality and flirt blindly.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t angry; she just took it as a chance to show her face.
 

 
The seats for the male and female leads were initially arranged together, but manager Chu directly discussed with Shi Qianqiu, explaining that her artist didn’t want to sit next to Chen Zhuzhi. Could they make some adjustments? Shi Qianqiu readily agreed, so the seating was changed to Tong Zhao sitting between Fu Xiaoheng and him.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was overjoyed and whispered, "Master, Master!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao thought she had broken character.
 

 
If it were a male actor like Song Wanzhuo, Tong Zhao would have snapped him out of it right then and there. But she had a bit more patience with girls. She wanted to ask Lu Xianzhang to come out and socialize with her apprentice, but since Lu Xianzhang was in a silent retreat, she gave up that thought and silently noted that Fu Xiaoheng was out of luck: "I’m here. What’s up?"
 

 
"I’m really happy to see you. Ever since I regained my memories, I’ve wanted to call you Master."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was actually a generation older than Tong Zhao, and when she smiled, there were fine lines at the corners of her eyes.
 

 
However, influenced by the memories from "Heartless Tribulation," she looked at Tong Zhao with adoring eyes, like a complete little fan.
 

 
This is one of the downsides of modern filmmaking!
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, go ahead and call me that."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng wanted to reminisce further.
 

 
But at that moment, the lights dimmed around them, and the screen slowly lit up…
# Chapter59
There is a saying commonly passed around:
 

 
"If you haven't acted in an instinctive movie, you've wasted your life."
 

 
Instinctive movies have an insatiable demand for extras.
 

 
For ordinary people, becoming an extra is not something unattainable. Many have "appearing in an instinctive movie" on their list of "things to accomplish before turning twenty," and many teenagers say that only after experiencing an instinctive movie do they realize how ordinary their "true selves" really are.
 

 
The experience of acting in an instinctive movie is also extremely unique.
 

 
The memories recalled in the mind are from a first-person perspective, which is different from the viewing angle when watching sample footage.
 

 
The final edited version, after post-production, is yet another thing altogether—
 

 
Since entering the era of instinctive movies, one of the most crucial tasks for directors has been film editing.
 

 
After the actors wrap up, Shi Qianqiu and his editing team "enter" ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ countless times, repeatedly using their own ideas and aesthetics to create the final version.
 

 
For instance, Tong Zhao had to go back and reshoot several scenes depicting Mu Yingchen and Shao Xuanzheng's memories when they were still a dual-cultivation couple.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang's subconscious couldn't handle acting out his dual cultivation life, so Tong Zhao had to step in herself to barely manage the plot setting of "the two being a couple" and complete the flashback scenes.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt she didn't do a good job in that segment.
 

 
At that time, Shi Qianqiu reassured her, saying he had a way to edit the scenes later, adding some details to make it more convincing.
 

 
If good subconscious performances from actors are like lyrics, the director is the composer.
 

 
Thus, the birth of good work requires both.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also curious how Shi Qianqiu would use editing to make up for her stiff performance... The Mu Yingchen she portrayed, although not outright cutting him down with a sword, showed a cold, disinterested attitude—a clear indication of a superficial relationship. There was no way to convey the contrast of someone who once deeply loved her husband, only to sever all ties after being betrayed.
 

 
The entire hall darkened completely.
 

 
...
 

 
The screen lit up with a classic aerial view of the Nine Provinces.
 

 
Many towering mountains shrouded in clouds came into view, followed by smooth cuts—
 

 
A vast, desolate, snow-covered icy landscape appeared, and in this barren whiteness, a slender, tall figure was captured in a low-to-high shot. Her jet-black hair fell gracefully, and she was the only trace of darkness in the scene, naturally drawing the audience's attention to her silhouette.
 

 
Then, she turned around.
 

 
Everyone knew this should be the female lead, Tong Zhao.
 

 
Almost all the audience knew what Tong Zhao looked like.
 

 
She’s been incredibly popular lately, and everyone must be very familiar with her face!
 

 
However, in that fleeting moment when she turned around, the audience was still stunned by her beauty, holding their breath for a second, unwilling to blink—
 

 
The moonlight illuminated Tong Zhao's face, cold and flawless.
 

 
If ordinary celestial maidens are like the distant, unattainable mist and clouds, then she is the wind and snow in a lonely, desolate mountain—proud and cold, with an air of solitary elegance. Her beautiful face was slightly raised, and as the snowflakes were about to land on her long lashes, they were shattered into powder by an invisible sword aura, dissolving into the wind before they could touch her.
 

 
[Oh my God, is she the real celestial being!]
 

 
[How can the same face be so powerful? Or is Tong Zhao actually a set of triplets? Although the face is the same, there are three different people behind it! The temperament is so distinct!]
 

 
[Got myself a stunning screensaver. Director Shi still knows how to shoot grand scenes. You can tell he’s a young master from a wealthy family.]
 

 
[This modeling isn’t just blowing wind and snow; it’s blowing money.]
 

 
The audience felt as though they were seeing her anew.
 

 
Amateurs focus on the spectacle, while experts see the technique.
 

 
Some film critics were already whispering to each other about Tong Zhao’s subconscious performance highlights this time.
 

 
Instinctive films of different genres each have their own challenges. For fantasy and immortal-themed films, it’s rare for anyone to capture the ethereal aura in the details.
 

 
It’s not just about having a pretty face.
 

 
Some subconscious performances, even if capable of summoning lightning with one hand and calling rain with the other, still come across as ordinary when dressed in a grand mage’s robe.
 

 
However, Lu Xianzhang’s subconscious, with just this single detail, allowed the audience to easily accept the image of "a cultivator"—these were all habits deeply ingrained in her subconscious daily life.
 

 
“Immortal Shao,”
 

 
Even her voice was cold, carrying a chill that could sting the face, with a hint of doubt: “Did you come all the way from the Nanhua Sword Sect just to meet me for the second time?”
 

 
Then, a series of montages conveyed to the audience the story of the two meeting, falling in love, and becoming cultivation partners.
 

 
“I, Shao Xuanzheng, vow by the sword in my hand and the path I uphold, to love only Mu Yingchen in this life.”
 

 
The clear and cheerful male voice echoed through the sky.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng, with a high-spirited look, his hair tied with a long hairpin, his handsome face complemented by his sky-blue robe, stood on a high platform like a nobleman stepping out of a painting. The light behind him outlined a glowing edge around him...
 

 
Tong Zhao finally understood what Shi Qianqiu meant by "a little detail."
 

 
In this long opening flashback, he made the male lead look particularly handsome, using various angles with ample surrounding light.
 

 
Next, he edited it as if it was the male lead through the eyes of the female lead—
 

 
The long shot showed her gazing at him with a pounding heart.
 

 
The medium shot showed them exchanging meaningful glances.
 

 
The close-up showed her lingering gaze, full of reluctance to part.
 

 
The idea is that when you like someone, you see them with a halo around them.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu used this mindset to draw the audience’s attention while guiding their thoughts in the direction he intended—that the female lead deeply loved the male lead, admired his charisma, and saw him through a thick, ten-layer filter of admiration.
 

 
Tong Zhao, watching with a detached and calm attitude, actually found herself convinced.
 

 
Seeing everyone around her engrossed in the movie, she knew she couldn’t engage in unprofessional behavior like whispering throughout the film, nor could she play on her phone and send WeChat messages. She had a strong urge to share her thoughts but had nowhere to express them—thankfully, she still had "herself"—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Wow, it really looks like I was madly in love with the male lead.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [The director has quite an artistic vision.]
 

 
Usually the most talkative, Concubine Chen was silent. Tong Zhao thought she might have been upset by the earlier comment about her switching partners rapidly and was about to console her when she heard brother Duan say: [She just woke Lu Xianzhang up forcefully.]
 

 
What happened?
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Quick, look at the movie scene Zhaozhao just saw. That’s your character.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang wasn’t keen on responding, but since they shared the same person and the same brain, the memories were shared. When Lu Xianzhang saw herself deeply in love with Shao Xuanzheng through Shi Qianqiu’s romantic editing, even someone as experienced as her almost had a minor breakdown: [......]
 

 
So, Lu Xianzhang, having just appeared, quickly withdrew into seclusion again.
 

 
Concubine Chen was delighted and joyfully fanned herself.
 

 
Apart from Tong Zhao and the post-production team of “The Heartless Tribulation”, who knew the truth, the rest of the audience was completely immersed in the movie's storyline. In the first less-than-ten-minute opening, the director sparingly gave the female lead few scenes, focusing more on "Shao Xuanzheng as seen through the eyes of the female lead." But whenever she appeared, every frame was unforgettable.
 

 
She was practicing swordsmanship alone on the peak of Nanhua Sword Sect.
 

 
In the past, she was "Immortal Mu" or "Fairy Yingchen." Now, people called her "Immortal Shao's partner."
 

 
After her master ascended, she returned to the immortal sect once and stood for a long time before the cliff engraved with the words "Heart Severance Peak."
 

 
The snow-white robe, once perfectly fitted, now seemed oversized on her, conveying a sense of loneliness and suggesting through visual cues that her post-marriage life outside the sect had not been happy.
 

 
There had been verbal disputes between the two.
 

 
Mu Yingchen's cultivation level was higher than his, but she never liked to argue with him. Each conflict ended in an unpleasant and unresolved manner.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu really knows how to film beautiful women.]
 

 
[Chen Zhuozhi’s performance doesn’t seem bad here? Why was he relegated to a supporting role?]
 

 
[“Not bad” my foot! Stay away from Fairy Yingchen! Zhaozhao should shine alone!]
 

 
In the first fifteen minutes, the crew successfully portrayed a reticent and aloof "Immortal Mu," whom the audience became accustomed to seeing always dressed in spotless white, with a flawless face. Though her perfection seemed almost unreal, it was still enjoyable—who doesn’t love watching a beauty?
 

 
A great beauty just needs to be responsible for being beautiful!
 

 
Besides, she was so powerful.
 

 
Was Tong Zhao's subconscious too strong, turning ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ into a movie where the heroine remains stunning throughout? It's not impossible. ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’ was also a film where she single-handedly dominated the entire show, and the response was good. Short, highly-praised reviews said that movie was both stress-relieving and exhilarating to watch.
 

 
Just as the audience began to wonder how the story would unfold, the hints laid earlier started to come together—
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was jealous of his partner’s talent and longed for his first love, his “white moonlight.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen never guarded against him.
 

 
At least, that’s the information conveyed through the editing.
 

 
When the audience saw Shao Xuanzheng plotting multiple schemes to poison her and destroy her golden core while she was weak, the comment section exploded:
 

 
[Oh my god, this scumbag is inhuman!]
 

 
[Fairy Yingchen’s golden core is so beautiful, just as bright and pure as she is, QAQ.]
 

 
[I want to buy Golden Core merchandise!]
 

 
[Shao, you bastard! Also, to the person who wants to buy the heroine's golden core merchandise, you successfully made me hold back my tears.]
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s golden core was shattered, and Shao Xuanzheng gleefully recounted how much he had endured her arrogance and pride over the years, and how he finally didn’t have to bear it anymore. Mu Yingchen just looked at him quietly, her beautiful face even paler than when she was in the freezing wasteland, but her eyes were still cold and bright: “Your plan succeeded not because I was arrogant, not because you were more cunning than me, but because you were despicable and vile enough, while I never guarded against my own partner.”
 

 
In the special viewing section, several familiar film critics were whispering their thoughts: “No matter what kind of adversity she faces, we’ve never seen Tong Zhao’s subconscious give up. This seems to be a common trait in many of her characters.”
 

 
“That’s what makes her subconscious so likable.”
 

 
“These lines are quite emotional, unlike what Shi Qianqiu would write. It must have been an impromptu addition from Tong Zhao’s subconscious.”
 

 
They nodded in agreement.
 

 
As if responding to the critics' words, the following scenes showed the fairy, who had been so perfectly portrayed in the first fifteen minutes, having her wings broken, pressed into the cold river, her soft black hair disheveled, and her once-pure white robe stained with blood, now in tatters.
 

 
The contrast was devastating.
 

 
Mu Yingchen, once so proud and clean, had been completely humiliated and used up by her lover.
 

 
The previously lively fans of Tong Zhao in the comment section went silent halfway through, while those who weren’t quiet were passionately cursing Shao Xuanzheng. Casual viewers, feeling sorry for the heroine’s plight, started discussing off-topic matters—what kind of person would Chen Zhuzhi be in real life to play such a despicable role?
 

 
The comment section then erupted with a round of gossip about Chen Zhuzhi’s controversies.
 

 
The first mini-climax of the first half came when Mu Yingchen, barely recovering from her serious injuries, cut off her own left hand in order to escape.
 

 
How painful must that have been!
 

 
But her face showed almost no expression, so calm it didn’t seem like she was cutting off her own hand.
 

 
Thus, everyone assumed Tong Zhao had the pain immunity mode on.
 

 
However, with the pain immunity fully activated, there would be logical inconsistencies, and the actors in the scene would sense something was off, so it wasn’t 100% pain immunity.
 

 
[Even at the maximum of 70%, it must still hurt a lot. Tong Zhao’s subconscious is truly resilient. Remember last time when she removed a bullet from her thigh wound? If there’s a big-budget action movie, they should definitely consider our girl.]
 

 
[No, no, no, no, please no. Just make some art films. It breaks my heart to see my wife getting hurt!]
 

 
After the heroine escaped, she stumbled upon the Li family caravan heading up the mountain.
 

 
This is a common trope in movies: first showing the protagonist in a pitiful and downtrodden state, while the villains appear glamorous and powerful. It’s a classic formula that the audience understands, but it still effectively stirs emotions. People want to see the protagonist turn the tables and get revenge, eagerly awaiting what’s next. But...
 

 
Renowned film critic Chen Shiyun sighed, “This girl really has an amazing presence. She’s so captivating. Even when she’s in rags, leaning against a tree in the dark, taking up only a small corner of the frame, I still can’t help but focus on her.”
 

 
The female critic next to him gave him a sidelong glance.
 

 
During the pre-screening event earlier, Chen Shiyun had been eagerly chatting with Tong Zhao, even exchanging WeChat contacts with her. After she left, he looked completely smitten, like he had fallen head over heels in love. She whispered to another female critic, “This must be what men are like.”
 

 
However, she had to admit that Tong Zhao had indeed captured seventy percent of her attention just now.
 

 
Even though Ding Jiao, who played Li Qiaoqiao, was dressed in exquisite clothes with numerous maids and servants around her, she still didn’t have that commanding presence. If there were points to be deducted from “Heartless Tribulation”, they would start with how it failed to suppress Tong Zhao’s presence.
 

 
But was that Ding Jiao’s fault for not being captivating enough, or was it Tong Zhao’s subconscious being too compelling?
 

 
It could only be said that competing on the same stage with such a "monster" is a kind of torment.
 

 
It seems that whether on or off screen, Ding Jiao could only serve as a foil to Tong Zhao...
 

 
The female critic who favored Ding Jiao sighed inwardly while giving Tong Zhao even higher marks in her notes.
 

 
The earlier scenes focused mostly on dialogue, and one critic remarked, “The opening showed the heroine practicing swordsmanship. Will there be action scenes showcasing her skills next? Or will it be purely magical combat? Shi Qianqiu’s films always involve a wave of expensive special effects.”
 

 
“That would be a waste of Tong Zhao’s subconscious,” another critic replied. “I fell in love with her because of ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’.”
 

 
“Haha, her action scenes in that movie were really impressive.”
 

 
Film critics are more sensitive to visual information than the average audience, and they tend to watch with a more detached mindset.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen discovered the woman locked up in the hunter’s cabin, many in the audience gasped, expecting the protagonist to unleash her power and rescue her. Tong Zhao’s subconscious was so calm and composed that it made the audience temporarily forget her dire situation—that she was currently a shattered Golden Core cultivator, with barely any spiritual power left and one hand severed.
 

 
“Oh? Instead of meeting a powerful ally, the protagonist encounters someone even weaker.” A critic expressed interest in Shi Qianqiu’s plot arrangement.
 

 
Male critics began discussing this point.
 

 
Meanwhile, the female critics, after exchanging opinions, found that they all liked this development.
 

 
Who needs a powerful ally?
 

 
Having Tong Zhao solo the entire scene is more than enough!
 

 
When Qingniang insisted that this “strange woman” was sure to save her, and Mu Yingchen reluctantly replied, “Alright, maybe you’re right,” the audience burst into small bursts of knowing laughter. The screen was filled with comments like [She really did it]—
 

 
Immediately afterward, Tong Zhao delivered a beautifully choreographed fight scene, drawing the audience, who had briefly relaxed, back into a state of tense focus.
 

 
[Another movie without a single dull moment.]
 

 
[Is this how one goes from an extra to a supporting role? Tong Zhao really took her on as an apprentice!]
 

 
[Damn, I’m so jealous of Qingniang. I want to be her apprentice too!]
 

 
After the initial satisfaction, the audience began repeating the call to become her apprentice.
 

 
Who wouldn’t want such a beautiful and powerful master?
 

 
By now, the main storyline of the movie had become very clear.
 

 
Compared to the female lead’s journey to find the divine sword and seek revenge, Shao Xuanzheng’s scenes were far less engaging. The director begrudgingly provided only some brief explanatory shots. Fans of Chen Zhuzhi were angrily criticizing Shi Qianqiu’s brutal editing for marginalizing their beloved actor, but their complaints were quickly drowned out by the mainstream voices.
 

 
Who cares about the scumbag's debauchery? The audience wanted to see more interactions between Mu Yingchen and her disciple.
 

 
In the first half-hour, the audience was introduced to Mu Yingchen’s ethereal, otherworldly side.
 

 
In the following half-hour, the audience gradually got to know her warm and endearing side... Actually, the Immortal Master wasn’t being cute, it was just her interactions with her disciple that were adorable. It was a classic “Clueless and Grumpy” duo that the audience fell for without even realizing it.
 

 
[Immortal Master: I’m fasting, but my disciple’s grilled fish? Hand it over.]
 

 
[Immortal Master, just spoil her already!]
 

 
[The orange dynamic is set, let the scumbag die quickly.]
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is certainly not a yuri film, and the director didn’t mislead the audience. It was made very clear that Qingniang’s feelings for her master are purely admiration and trust, transcending romantic love—a steadfast choice...
 

 
And that makes it even more shippable!
 

 
What's the point of shipping an official CP? It’s the ones that are explicitly denied that are the most fun to ship.
 

 
Tong Zhao has worked with the "big wolf dog" Song Wanzhuo and played a couple with the "little puppy" Tang Jingjie, but neither CP made much of a splash. After filming, the hype faded away quickly. No one expected that later on, this master-disciple pair would become Tong Zhao's most prolific and popular fan-created CP.
 

 
Back to the film.
 

 
When the disciple was about to sacrifice herself to the furnace, an orange-colored comment shot across the screen—
 

 
[The master-disciple CP is real! Mom, I’m shipping it for real!]
 

 
The discussion was still mostly about the plot.
 

 
[Qingniang hates being used so much, but she’s willing to let her master use her...]
 

 
[No, little disciple, don’t die! Are there any Shi Qianqiu fans here? He wouldn’t be so cruel, right?]
 

 
[Don’t get your hopes up about Shi the Scoundrel’s conscience. He’s a disciple of Gen Urobuchi.]
 

 
[Urobuchi, put down that pen!!]
 

 
Mu Yingchen, on her journey to find the divine sword with her little disciple, was far more relaxed and happy than during her dual cultivation period with Shao Xuanzheng. The sweetness in the middle was so intense that the audience didn’t realize there were blades hidden in the candy until now, leaving them unexpectedly chewing on shards of glass, mouths bleeding, and tears falling.
 

 
Xu Xiaoheng, who played the little disciple, had tears in her eyes.
 

 
She glanced surreptitiously at Tong Zhao...
 

 
Off-screen, Tong Zhao sat upright, her heavily made-up face showing no emotion. There was no hint of distraction, only contemplation. Xu Xiaoheng felt a bit disheartened as she looked away, thinking that Tong Zhao truly lived up to her superstar status, remaining unaffected by the emotions in the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Didn’t expect it—Immortal Lu is a potential lesbian heartbreaker too.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [“Thank you, luckily I’m very straightforward.”]
 

 
Tong Zhao watched the movie she starred in with the same mindset as an esports player reviewing match footage—purely analytical, unaffected by the memories and emotions involved.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen pinned her disciple down and leaped into the roaring sword furnace, the comments were filled with shock and tears.
 

 
There were also some out-of-place comments:
 

 
[“Jojo, I’m not human anymore!”]
 

 
[“...Refund my tears!”]
 

 
[“I beg the brothers in front of me, crying and laughing really looks insane.”]
 

 
At this point, "Heartless Tribulation" officially entered the thrilling segment of continuous climaxes. Clichéd, as it may be, executing it well, isn’t easy; audiences need to feel satisfied for the box office to do well. The director stopped toying with the audience, generously granting the protagonist a powerful boost, allowing her to make a grand comeback.
 

 
The pacing from setup to explosion was handled perfectly by the director.
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s subconscious has an advantage; her comebacks are always satisfying. Even a director with basic aesthetics can edit them well,” said one film critic.
 

 
“Exactly, Tong Zhao’s scene here,” one critic who preferred domestic animation recalled an older traditional film: “It reminds me of the climax in ‘White Snake’ when Sun Wukong breaks his seal due to Jiang Liuer’s death, igniting with red light—a moment that, if captured well, would be memorable and exhilarating.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s astonishing sword strike reduced Shao Xuanzheng to ashes.
 

 
In the end, the scumbag was left with nothing.
 

 
...
 

 
After the movie concluded, thunderous applause erupted in the venue.
 

 
The lights gradually brightened, and the list of creators began to roll. Below, Chen Zhuzhi found his name in the cast section, his fist clenched so tightly he nearly broke his fake smile. Next came the interview and Q&A segment, with the crew heading to the designated press area. After this, there would be an after-party exclusively for special guests...
 

 
Of course, this would be a gathering for various bigwigs and critics, heavily imbued with socializing and networking.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked her, “I edited it well, right?”
 

 
“It’s good,” Tong Zhao acknowledged, “especially that opening segment; I can’t believe you managed to cut it so emotionally.”
 

 
“I added a million little details.”
 

 
They spoke in hushed tones under the excited camera flashes, like two artists discussing the beautiful scenes of a film. Many of the positive reports from this premiere featured that candid shot.
 

 
The audience applauded more enthusiastically to invite the crew members on stage.
 

 
The main cast of "Heartless Tribulation" was quite small, primarily thanks to Shi Qianqiu, who served as producer, investor, screenwriter, and director all in one, thereby consolidating several key roles and simplifying things.
 

 
The order of questions had already been arranged.
 

 
After the screening, the online audience dispersed as well.
 

 
They might remain immersed in the excitement of the film for a while, sharing their thoughts on social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and various forums. However, that was a matter for public relations and marketing companies to monitor. Only the more dedicated fans and actor supporters stayed for the interview segment.
 

 
The first questions were posed by well-known authoritative media outlets, and the queries were quite standard.
 

 
“First of all, congratulations on making such an excellent film,” the reporter said formulaically before continuing, “I understand that ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was originally an experimental film with two protagonists. Such a large production for an experiment could only be achieved by Director Shi. So why did it end up becoming a single-protagonist film?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s smile gradually faded.
 

 
“I’m very fair,”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied with a smile. “Whoever performs well gets to be the protagonist; if she can steal the show, that’s her talent. I truly didn’t expect her to excel to the point of exhibiting overwhelming dominance… The final cut of the film is essentially a single-protagonist movie; adding anyone else wouldn’t fit.”
 

 
A reporter, sensing a point of contention, asked, “Is Tong Zhao’s performance significantly better than Chen Zhuzhi’s? What does the actress herself think?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, “The result is right there in the movie; you all saw it just now.”
 

 
Why even ask?
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi felt a murderous urge rising within him.
 

 
However, he didn’t dare contradict Shi Qianqiu and could only respond stiffly, “Of course, I’m willing to cooperate with the director’s arrangements.”
 

 
The reporter then asked a few questions about box office predictions and marketing plans, which made the fans feel drowsy until the second half, when the questions started to get a bit more interesting—
 

 
“As of today, Tong Zhao, your performances in ‘Ming Emperor,’ ‘72 Hours,’ and ‘Sea King Kill’ have shown a lot of variation in your subconscious. There has been much speculation from the outside; how do you think you accomplished this? Is it really due to having triplets?” The reporter ended with a joke.
 

 
The audience watching the interview livestream perked up.
 

 
Great question!
 

 
This was the issue they were most concerned about!
 

 
“First of all, I can assure you that I am an only child,”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed, showing her calm and cheerful side as always in front of the camera. “I’ve gone through many changes during my growth process, and I’ve had very different thoughts at different stages. The differences are so stark that they seem like they wouldn’t appear in the same person. Before entering the holographic chamber, I would immerse myself in the mindset of that period, which is why it looks so special. Of course, they are all me.”
 

 
As she finished, her slightly curved eyes sparkled with gentle smiles.
 

 
Tong Zhao loves herself too much.
 

 
[Beauty fans are fully satisfied!]
 

 
[Ahhh, my wife is smiling at me! Where’s the best place to buy a house in the school district?]
 

 
[Whether she’s the cold and aloof fairy or the private Tong Zhao, I want them all!]
 

 
Tong Zhao, professionally exuding her glamorous aura, had an extremely strong presence, but her usual demeanor was a bit more reserved than concubine Chen’s and not as sharp and cold as Lu Xianchang’s. Overall, she was more warm and worldly, making her more acceptable to mainstream audiences.
 

 
The reporter, subconsciously influenced by her aura, ended up focusing more on her despite the intention to share the spotlight evenly.
 

 
Ding Jiao’s fans were about to complain about the bias when they noticed how their younger sister looked at Tong Zhao…
 

 
The orange forces were in trouble!
 

 
“Director Shi has a habit of making things difficult for actors. I’ve heard that Tong Zhao is the director’s favorite instinctive actor? Did anything interesting happen during your collaboration?”
 

 
“Make things difficult for actors?” Shi Qianqiu asked, puzzled, turning to look at the other crew members. “Did I? I don’t think so. But Tong Zhao is indeed my favorite actor; her subconscious is very creative—she’s the most unique one I’ve ever seen.”
 

 
“We won’t compare with the tweezers and bullet clips!”
 

 
This cross-regional interaction not only had netizens laughing out loud but also sparked interest in the film.
 

 
The news about “Heartless Tribulation” causing many female actors to return home empty-handed was a long time ago. With He Duoduo mentioning it here and marketing accounts reposting it, netizens began to reminisce—miraculously, there was no situation of disparaging each other; instead, they could only exclaim that Tong Zhao’s subconscious was too powerful and feminine.
 

 
[If you want to compete with Tong Zhao, you have to go to the male actor circle.]
 

 
[The hard male actors in domestic entertainment all have uncle vibes; why not go to foreign entertainment to compete?]
 

 
[Support my sister in breaking out of Asia and bringing glory to the country! /doge /doge]
 

 
These joking comments shifted netizens’ and fans’ attention to just how powerful Tong Zhao really was.
 

 
After one content creator compiled all of Tong Zhao’s action scenes, the view count skyrocketed, landing it in the top three of the film and television section on Bilibili. After watching, netizens couldn’t help but fall into deep contemplation.
 

 
Is this the same person who danced the jumping jingling dance, single-handedly battled an army of zombies, and after severing her left hand, still managed to take down the scumbag?
 

 
Is it really the same person?
 

 
The edited video, along with Tong Zhao’s interview after the premiere of “Heartless Tribulation,” explained this phenomenon.
 

 
Netizens started to wonder what major changes Tong Zhao had experienced in her life.
 

 
Since she rarely talked about her past experiences, they began to fill in the gaps with grandiose imaginings based on her distinctive subconscious—
 

 
The imperial concubine always gets what she wants.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have had a rich romantic history; she’s an old sea king.
 

 
Feng Yanqi is decisive and incredibly cool.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have great leadership skills; she was probably the boss back in school.
 

 
Mu Yingchen has an ethereal quality, completely detached from the mortal world.
 

 
Perhaps one day Tong Zhao will hold a press conference to announce that she’s going to inherit her family’s Taoist temple.
 

 
As the speculation became increasingly absurd, netizens envisioned Tong Zhao as having had a tumultuous and extraordinary first half of her life.
 

 
[Ah, I really want to be childhood friends with Sister Zhao; her life must be amazing!]
 

 
...
 

 
Xu Zhu, who grew up with Tong Zhao, felt very confused.
 

 
Wasn’t she just an ordinary rich girl?
 

 
Romantic experiences? She hasn’t even dated!
 

 
Leadership skills? Tong Zhao doesn’t even participate in clubs!
 

 
Xu Zhu also knew very well that the Tong family didn’t have a Taoist temple to inherit.
 

 
What a tumultuous first half of life!
 

 
However, with the immense popularity of “Heartless Tribulation,” netizens’ curiosity continued to grow. The discussion remained heated, and they finally managed to uncover some clues about her background through Tong Zhao’s old classmates…
# Chapter60
No wall cannot be broken through in this world.
 

 
If there is, it must be because the previous hammering wasn't forceful enough.
 

 
And this time, "Heartless Tribulation" is so hot that the curiosity of netizens about its sole protagonist, Tong Zhao, is like a giant iron hammer, constantly pounding away with "Eighty!" "Eighty!" until it finally breaks through the wall.
 

 
Just how popular is "Heartless Tribulation"?
 

 
On its opening day, it raked in 183 million yuan, contributing nearly ninety percent of the total box office for that day. Other films released around the same time were pitifully compared to it, and the entire industry knew that Shi Qianqiu was about to produce another phenomenal work.
 

 
It's infuriating how people can make you feel inadequate!
 

 
New directors fear nothing more than investors losing faith in them.
 

 
Shi, coming from a wealthy background, had plenty of opportunities to try and fail, and his innate talent helped him soar once he got going.
 

 
So while his peers were envious of him, they wouldn’t lose their composure; they could only sigh at how lucky he was.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" took years to finally start filming, and it truly allowed him to meet Tong Zhao, who delivered an unparalleled and outstanding performance, creating an unforgettable Mu Yingchen for the audience. It’s hard to say whether it was his keen eye for talent or just pure luck. With the year-end Best Instinct Film Awards approaching, nominations were guaranteed, and one could anticipate wins for Best Modeling and Best Actress—just thinking about it made one envious.
 

 
As for the Best Modeling Award…
 

 
There’s no helping it; the budget is what it is.
 

 
The modeling rental fees for many grand scenes in "Heartless Tribulation" weren’t cheap, let alone original constructions—all the funding was going up in flames.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was particularly generous with his spending.
 

 
Meanwhile, films with similar themes have seen a slight uptick in box office earnings due to its influence—
 

 
Although most new reviews criticize them for being far inferior to "Heartless Tribulation," it's still enjoyable to eat alongside the big brother.
 

 
Making money isn’t embarrassing.
 

 
…
 

 
"Recent Major Film's Female Lead Background Revealed"
 

 
“Wait, are the two actresses in 'Countdown 72 Hours' actually good friends? They don’t look like it!”
 

 
“TZ and XZ have been good friends from middle school to high school, and there are solid photos to prove it.”
 

 
…
 

 
Among the trending topics on Weibo is a high school photo of Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu.
 

 
In the photo, the two girls are not wearing any makeup and have innocent looks on their faces.
 

 
Even without makeup, it’s clear that the girl on the right with flowing long hair is Tong Zhao. She has prominent features; her three-dimensional facial structure has already blossomed into a beauty that could withstand the test of the big screen. Her bright, curved eyes and radiant smile make her look carefree.
 

 
In comparison, Xu Zhu, standing to her left, appears somewhat indistinct.
 

 
The backdrop of the photo features a well-manicured lawn, and the source claims this is a corner of an expensive private school.
 

 
Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao are both female, so even if they were old acquaintances, it wouldn't be big news.
 

 
The issue arises from their past collaboration.
 

 
During the filming of “Countdown 72 Hours,” the relationship they portrayed on and off-screen was very cold, with zero interaction during promotional events. In the movie, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, also treats her older sister Feng Yanqi poorly.
 

 
However, the newly revealed photo shows the two holding hands, looking like a pair of good friends.
 

 
The informant also stated that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu were inseparable good sisters.
 

 
They even took the same private car to and from school.
 

 
Tong Zhao is from a wealthy family, but there’s no information about Xu Zhu’s family; she hasn’t mentioned it.
 

 
With the photo as proof, the credibility of this anonymous tip has greatly increased. Riding on the film's success and Tong Zhao’s own popularity, discussions among netizens began to surge.
 

 
Excited fans of Xu Zhu jumped in:
 

 
[Little sister is indeed a princess raised with love.]
 

 
[Wow, this school is obviously expensive; she’s definitely a child who can go home to inherit the family business if she doesn’t work hard on her dancing.]
 

 
[The beautiful sister's friend is a fairy sister; I'm in awe.]
 

 
Compared to the excitement of Xu Zhu's fans, Tong Zhao's fans focused more on seeing old photos of their idol.
 

 
[The only good thing about this photo leak is that it proves Tong Zhao's natural beauty; she hasn't had any plastic surgery.]
 

 
[Friendships from school days don’t mean much; let’s just wait patiently for Sister Zhao to speak up.]
 

 
Since Xu Zhu debuted in “Star Selection Girls,” she hasn’t made much of a splash aside from a poorly received apocalyptic film. Under Tong Zhenming's connections, she managed to land the leading role in a drama, but unfortunately, it received a lukewarm response after airing. In contrast, whatever Tong Zhao stars in becomes a hit, and “Heartless Tribulation” catapulted her, albeit temporarily, to the status of box office goddess; she just needs one more movie to maintain her position.
 

 
In terms of status, popularity, and the allure of subconscious charm, the two are not on the same level.
 

 
Unless the main person initiates interaction, Tong Zhao’s fans would definitely not like to see their idol being overshadowed by a talent show contestant trying to ride the wave of popularity.
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans, on the other hand, saw it differently.
 

 
They believed that as long as they remained polite, it would definitely be a positive interaction since their sister wouldn’t lose anything.
 

 
Meanwhile, those who truly understood the relationship between the two, particularly in the second-generation circle, especially the WeChat group of Zeshan Company—
 

 
Second Generation C: [Weibo Link]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Ah, this]
 

 
Second Generation B: [Ah, this 1]
 

 
Second Generation D: [Where's Tong Zhao? Quickly @ Tong Zhao, we can't let this white lotus ride the wave of popularity!]
 

 
Since Tong Zhao hadn’t shown up, they were muttering among themselves, waiting to understand her stance before publicly expressing their support. Clearly, the old man from the Tong family was in the wrong; this was not handled properly. They were professional rich kids, often getting into trouble and having one or two cards cut off by their families, relying only on their five-figure “meager” allowances and friends to survive until their elders cooled down.
 

 
That was called getting lectured by their parents.
 

 
But what about Tong Zhao’s family?
 

 
It was clearly bullying their sister Zhao to death, wanting to elevate the mistress's pair of children.
 

 
Just after finishing a grueling body practice and covered in sweat, Tong Zhao walked out of the bathroom and received a call from her agent: “You and Xu Zhu are good sisters? Why didn't you tell me?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
That term “good sisters” was a shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a big sip of mineral water: “Good thing I hadn’t eaten; otherwise, I’d be sick.”
 

 
“What’s going on?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't like to talk about her family matters. It was impossible for her to voluntarily share her sob story; knowing her current self was enough, and there was no need to be overly curious about her past. However, since Sister Chu asked, there had to be a reason behind it, so she briefly explained her background as concisely as possible: “She’s my half-sister.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “!!!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Xu Zhu's mom used to be my mom’s subordinate and close friend. My mom considered her a true friend. During her pregnancy, she secretly climbed into my dad’s bed and ended up pregnant with Xu Zhu. So, we’re very close in age, essentially blooming from both ends. My mom thought she was tricked by a scumbag and got pregnant out of wedlock, so she took care of her in various ways and even later moved in with us.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “???"
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Later, my mom passed away. The mistress successfully gave birth to a son and fulfilled my dad’s dream of continuing the family line. After she moved in, I had a fight with him and severed our father-daughter relationship, then moved out. The subsequent events fast-forwarded to me acting in 'The Legend of Ming Emperor.'”
 

 
The amount of information was overwhelming, and Sister Chu felt a bit dizzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao's tone was so calm, as if she were talking about someone else.
 

 
But upon reflection, it was indeed a tumultuous tale of love and hate that shattered one's worldview.
 

 
“Then why did you take on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’…”
 

 
It must have been difficult to perform alongside her enemy's daughter. Sister Chu felt a sympathetic affection for the girl.
 

 
However, the sympathy lasted no more than three seconds before the young girl countered, “What’s there to not take on? At that time, it was a great resource for me, and besides, it should be her who can’t face me; I have nothing to hide from her.”
 

 
She had thought it through too clearly.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu has always wanted to compete with her.
 

 
Competing for the title of “daughter of Tong Zhenming,” competing for the image of a “rich beauty,” and competing for the public's affection.
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it and realized this was indeed the case.
 

 
So she summarized what had happened online: “I’m here to clarify your stance; as good as it sounds, the company doesn’t want you to get involved with her. It’s best to distance yourself a bit; otherwise, you’ll lose your prestige.”
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and opened her WeChat page, where she saw messages of concern from her friends.
 

 
Wei Zekai exploded in the group chat.
 

 
Boss Kai: [I want to confront her! @Tong Zhao]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, come out, I can’t hold it in anymore, I really want to curse that girl]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, we have group photos too, can I post two?]
 

 
Wei Zekai was so angry.
 

 
His relationship with Tong Zhao was so solid.
 

 
Then he woke up to see that, well, Xu Zhu had become Tong Zhao’s best friend.
 

 
This was more than just the house collapsing; it was like being robbed!
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. Did he not understand the situation? He was even jealous of Xu Zhu: [Go ahead and post.]
 

 
She thought for a moment: [Let them curse; I’m not planning to give her any face.]
 

 
After telling her friends, she expressed to Sister Chu: “I don’t want everyone to pay too much attention to my private affairs. Xu Zhu shouldn’t want to stir up sisterhood for attention either; she’s more anxious than I am, afraid I’ll expose her dirty laundry.”
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it too.
 

 
Xu Zhu had created an image of a rich and beautiful princess for herself. If her fans found out her mom was a mistress, her persona would collapse, and her fans would scatter: “But dealing with this kind of rich family matter... it’s not very appropriate for either the company or you to bring it up; it feels a bit low-class.”
 

 
“No,”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked slightly: “I’ll just go along with it; someone wants to vent for me.”
 

 
“Who?” After asking, Sister Chu recalled a name: “Wei Zekai? Or Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
“Not just Wei Zekai, but some other friends too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao casually mentioned a list of flashy second-generation names that exuded a "smell of copper": "Why bring up Director Shi? I'm not familiar with him. Don’t be fooled by him praising me everywhere; in private, he doesn't even like my posts in our social circles. It's the purest colleague relationship."
 

 
"As long as it's not him, but you still have your CP super topic with Director Shi," her manager teased her. "With that tone you just used, I thought Xu Zhu was going to cut off a couple of her arms."
 

 
...
 

 
Time was precious, and they stopped chatting about personal matters. Sister Chu hung up the phone to align the company's public relations stance, while Tong Zhao dried her hair, played with her phone, and scrolled through Weibo and WeChat to observe the situation.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Zhu was also feeling anxious.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously blacklisted her, and she had cut ties with any mutual friends who kept in touch with Xu Zhu; it was quite definitive. Xu Zhu really didn't dare to rely on her fame; it was just that once someone becomes famous, their past is bound to be dug up, catching her off guard.
 

 
Xu Zhu had a lot she wanted to say to Tong Zhao.
 

 
— You’re in a rising phase now; exposing this kind of information, even if you’re the victim, will affect your image.
 

 
— Is it really good to drag family into this? Your mother just passed away not long ago; if this gets out, many people will definitely talk about her.
 

 
— Tong Zhao, your movie has been successful again. You've already achieved everything; can we just pretend we never knew each other?
 

 
It was useless; Tong Zhao simply didn’t answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.
 

 
Xu Zhu now just wanted to find out who leaked the information and give them a good beating.
 

 
Xu Zhu opened Weibo.
 

 
So far, no one had mentioned her background. She had a strong sense of pride; her old classmates didn’t know what her family did, and since they saw her lifestyle was high-end, they thought she was from the same social class. Weibo was calm, with Tong Zhao's fans not particularly liking her, but they hadn’t escalated the situation, as if it were the calm before a storm.
 

 
She clicked on the group photo.
 

 
After a moment of thought, Xu Zhu remembered what they had been doing back then.
 

 
Right, at that time, Tong Zhao had been taking tennis lessons with her, and afterward, they asked a passing classmate to help them take a hand-holding photo on the lawn... Tong Zhao looked better than her, so she didn’t particularly like to be in the same frame with her, but on that day, perhaps because the weather was too nice, the dopamine released from intense exercise influenced her, making her inexplicably want a photo together.
 

 
In the picture, the two of them really looked like they were very close.
 

 
Xu Zhu irritably put down her phone.
 

 
The gossip about "good sisters" wasn’t that interesting; just as netizens were about to lose interest, a major influencer suddenly compiled a collection of posts by the second-generation rich, with Wei Zekai leading the way—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [@Star Selection Girl Xu Zhu, stay away from my brother.]
 

 
Second-Gen A: [Ordinary good sisters share food, jewelry, and daily life, but sister Zhu’s good sisters share about her dad.]
 

 
Second-Gen B: [sister Zhu really knows how to play the role of the rich beauty; her mother can charm a man into kicking his eldest daughter out and cutting off her financial support. The mistress who climbs to the top is forever a goddess!]
 

 
Second-Gen C: [The three-year period is up; as for the Tong family, it’s fine to let them go! Let us at Zeshan Company welcome Boss Zhao back to her rightful place—]
 

 
The rich second-generation crowd didn't engage in the entertainment industry's superficial politeness; they were sarcastic and even tagged people directly, not afraid of escalating the situation, which kept netizens’ minds busy as they realized it had turned into a wealthy family feud!
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans were confused.
 

 
What did it mean for a mistress to rise to power and for a bird to take over another’s nest?
 

 
Some younger fans were upset and questioned them in the comments, but the second-generation crowd didn’t care; the more they fought back, the more dirt came to light.
 

 
Since much of the information emerged from nested comments, it was somewhat disorganized. By the end of the afternoon, a representative had compiled a timeline that clarified the relationship between Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao, even uncovering the company and connections behind the Tong family—
 

 
Goodness, they were actually one of the main investors in "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
Many viewers who followed this season’s talent show were fans of other contestants and had their own suspicions about who seemed pre-determined to debut; Xu Zhu was one of those "chosen ones," but her singing and dancing skills were merely acceptable and hadn't been scrutinized deeply.
 

 
Once this was uncovered...
 

 
The dirt had been dug up, causing some upper-ranking contestants who didn’t qualify for debut to feel indignant.
 

 
If this information had been revealed earlier, it might have opened up a spot for their younger sister.
 

 
Unfortunately, there were no "what ifs" in this world.
 

 
The only way to vent their frustration was to lash out at Xu Zhu.
 

 
The audience of "Star Selection Girl" began to recount the details Xu Zhu had previously crafted for her "rich princess" persona, realizing it had all been a façade.
 

 
Some fans didn’t believe it.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu seemed very at ease and natural when using expensive skincare products and designer handbags; she didn’t seem like a nouveau riche.
 

 
A rich second-generation individual responded to this argument from fans: [Of course she seems natural because Tong Zhao's mother treated her like the daughter of a good friend, buying double of everything so they could use it together. She’s gotten used to leeching off that, sucking blood like a vampire, and she continues to do so.]
 

 
[Hahaha, you can tell they’re a seasoned player with that comment.]
 

 
[Uh, actually, Tong Zhao’s mom seems a bit foolish, right? Didn’t she notice the signs? It’s quite remarkable that a dumpling could raise someone like Tong Zhao with such subconscious traits.]
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao had never brought this up on her own, as she didn’t want people discussing her mother.
 

 
In her dark, single apartment, she curled up on the soft couch, with only the light from her phone illuminating the space.
 

 
Her WeChat group was discussing her situation.
 

 
Whenever she wanted, she could join the discussion and accept her friends' comfort.
 

 
They all felt indignant on her behalf and were heartbroken for her… Compared to her past life, she truly had so much more in this one.
 

 
After watching for a while, she still chose to speak to the persona in her mind: [My mom is indeed a bit foolish.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [She doesn’t have an eye for people.]
 

 
Han Zhi: 【But that doesn’t justify her friend’s husband betraying her.】
 

 
They all shared Tong Zhao’s perspective and saw some of the “self-inflicted” comments.
 

 
This victim-blaming theory was just a small portion of the voices.
 

 
[I was also quite foolish back then,]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was restrained and detached, as if she were talking about someone else, but it gradually lowered: [I won’t be foolish anymore. I won’t be foolish again.]
 

 
Tong Zhao saw a netizen saying that her mother's foolishness harmed her and chuckled lightly: [According to the logic of “mother’s debt is repaid by the daughter,” I won’t let go of anyone who has hurt her. She is responsible for being foolish and falling for tricks; I am responsible for slapping faces and taking revenge. Sounds good.]
 

 
…
 

 
As the once-dirty secrets were laid bare in the sunlight, the beautifully packaged little princess revealed her true form.
 

 
Countless netizens and disappointed fans bombarded the phone lines of the entertainment company that Xu Zhu was signed to. She had truly become "famous," but it was a kind of fame akin to being burned by fire. The company tried to contact Tong Zhao's manager, but all they said was that the artist clearly refused to communicate. Xu Zhu also stated that everything they said was true.
 

 
With deep-seated grievances, how could there be any communication?
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
Everything is true.
 

 
With these four words posted, all possibilities for private negotiation from Xu Zhu's side were completely blocked.
 

 
The situation Xu Zhu faced was even more serious than that of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had a solid foundation and works, and when domestic violence erupted, it drove away a large number of fans while awakening a batch of confused minds. Xu Zhu, on the other hand, was a shallow-rooted contestant; if it weren’t for her wealthy background and connections, she would have been just a quickly-fading commodity from the moment she debuted. Now, with her carefully crafted persona collapsing, all the air she had been holding onto was gone.
 

 
That day, Xu Zhu returned home from the dormitory, unable to face the questions of the other members of "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
But that place couldn’t even be considered her home.
 

 
When the incident made headlines in entertainment news, Tong Zhenming returned, enraged after being met with strange looks from the company’s shareholders. He forbade her from dreaming of being a star again: “If you still want to acknowledge me as your father, then stay out of the spotlight and behave yourself at home! After wasting so much time and acting like a demon for so long, you should know that you’re not cut out for this.”
 

 
Xu Zhu lowered her head and remained silent.
 

 
Her silence was a sign of her unwillingness to admit guilt; Tong Zhenming wanted her to apologize.
 

 
“...I know I was wrong; I’m sorry.”
 

 
Xu Zhu's eyes turned red.
 

 
Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let her leave, pressing down on her shoulder: “What did you do wrong?”
 

 
In that moment, immense grievance exploded from Xu Zhu’s chest. She looked up and glared at her biological father with hatred: “I was wrong for competing with Tong Zhao. I can’t compete with her for what I want, and everything I’ve fought for is worthless!”
 

 
She shrank her shoulders, rushed back to her room, and slammed the door shut, ignoring her father’s attempts to pound on it.
 

 
The Tong family was still wealthy, and the door was solidly built.
 

 
Just when things were going wrong, Xu Zhu felt even more humiliated. Ning Zhiyi suggested they take a break from each other to cool off.
 

 
She felt numb.
 

 
The dream of becoming a star that she wanted to snatch away from Tong Zhao was never hers to take.
 

 
The two men she had managed to win over didn’t love her; they loved themselves and their interests.
 

 
Xu Zhu buried her face in the pillow and cried for a while. Once she calmed down, she gradually accepted the reality that she had to give up her dream of stardom. If she couldn’t surpass her stepsister, she might as well return to being a wealthy young lady. Netizens wouldn’t be able to do anything to her.
 

 
Maybe later she could apologize to Tong Zhenming in a soft tone, she thought.
 

 
At least she would still be a young lady, able to live the affluent life she had always wanted, the life a Tong family heiress should have.
 

 
Even though “Heartless Tribulation” had become a hit, the actors didn’t receive a share of the investment profits; Tong Zhao would only get her original salary, which was definitely less than making a business profit. Thinking of this, Xu Zhu felt a slight rise in her fondness for her father.
 

 
This man held grudges, couldn’t stand being defied by juniors, and it seemed that this time, she would have to kneel and admit her mistakes to return to being his “good daughter”…
 

 
However, Tong Zhenming wasn’t angry about her behavior this time.
 

 
He had a more urgent matter to deal with—
 

 
Three companies that had been collaborating with them suddenly announced they wouldn’t work with the Tong family anymore.
 

 
A product that brought in steady profits for the Tong family faced competition, significantly affecting cash flow. The management could no longer hide the situation after seeing the reports and had to report it upward.
 

 
Wasn’t everything going well?
 

 
Forget it; if it doesn’t work, they’ll just have to change partners. China is so big; finding clients isn’t that hard, right?
 

 
Tong Zhenming was shocked to realize that this was a premeditated and organized attack from several companies with strong momentum. Some were new companies, while others, previously struggling, suddenly had best-selling new products or incredibly profitable projects…
 

 
As for other local companies, as soon as they heard it was the Tong family, they were unwilling to wade into such muddy waters.
 

 
Tong Zhenming sent gifts and treated people to meals, only then learning about half of the truth behind the scenes.
 

 
The Wei family had only one young master, Wei Zekai.
 

 
No matter how useless he might be, everything would eventually be left to him.
 

 
Wei Zekai had posted ten Weibo messages cursing the illegitimate daughter and Tong Zhenming. Even if the Wei family hadn’t said anything, everyone tacitly acknowledged that the two families had fallen out.
 

 
Why would anyone risk offending the Wei family to help Tong Zhenming get through this crisis?
 

 
They weren’t foolish.
 

 
Unless there was a higher profit to be gained!
 

 
Given the high margins involved, it wouldn’t be impossible to cooperate.
 

 
The result was that if Tong Zhenming wanted to endure this situation, he would have to give up the vast majority of the profits.
 

 
“A bunch of capitalists sucking the marrow out of bones!”
 

 
He cursed bitterly, inadvertently including himself in the insult.
 

 
Tong Zhenming blamed everything on Wei Zekai, overlooking the other half of the truth.
 

 
During the same period, the second-generation wealthy individuals who voiced support for Tong Zhao on Weibo faced reprimands at home due to their low status. Their elders felt it was embarrassing for them to be in the news for cursing online, and they quickly cut off their financial support, wanting them to reflect on their actions and not offend people recklessly. They weren’t all from families as stable and prestigious as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
However, this time, the economic sanctions were ineffective.
 

 
Because those who had latched onto Tong Zhao, listened to her, and stirred up investment projects, the Ze Shan venture capital they had whimsically formed…
 

 
Actually made money.
 

 
Not only did they make money, but they also received dividends on the spot!
 

 
The second-generation individuals, driven purely by passion to support Tong Zhao, stared at the long string of zeros in their balances, alongside messages from their siblings on WeChat saying, “That so-called friend of yours? Now that she has no support from home, she’s just another girl hustling in the entertainment industry. Don’t let yourself be used without realizing it. Dad has frozen your card. You can borrow from other second-generations, but can you borrow from that female celebrity?”…
 

 
They truly didn’t know how to respond.
 

 
At the same time, in the Ze Shan venture capital shareholders' WeChat group.
 

 
Second Generation A: [Wait, weren’t we losing money together while doing charity?]
 

 
Second Generation C: [How could any project that my brother Kai invests in actually make money!?]
 

 
Boss Kai: [I'll give you all a chance to withdraw and reorganize your statements.]
 

 
When people are in extreme shock, they often speak their true feelings.
 

 
Among them, some had personally supervised the investment projects and had seen them improving, but Brother Kai's reputation for losing money was too strong. They were internally at ease, waiting for the day the project would collapse, never expecting to make a profit.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [As long as I'm here, we won't lose money.]
# Chapter61
After Ze Shan group was established, Tong Zhao invested in several projects that she believed would become popular.
 

 
Of course, her investments weren't made blindly.
 

 
What if the movies she produced unintentionally set off a butterfly effect?
 

 
To earn money in the long run, it's crucial to understand the underlying meaning behind investments. Many people lose money in stocks simply by following tips about stocks that are supposedly guaranteed to be profitable, only to jump in without understanding. They wait too long to sell, thinking they might make more, and end up losing it all.
 

 
Tong Zhao used her foresight to eagerly absorb various knowledge, filtering out reliable and sustainable projects that could be managed by Wei Zekai and his team. She was too busy with announcements to do anything other than make decisions, so she often delegated tasks.
 

 
She didn’t put all her eggs in one basket.
 

 
Even if a stock in her memory was set to soar, she only invested a portion.
 

 
The money she missed out on was part of her risk assessment; it didn’t count as a loss.
 

 
Second Generation A: "If I had known that 721 would skyrocket, I would have borrowed heavily to invest!"
 

 
Second Generation D: "I borrowed from the loan sharks!"
 

 
Boss Kai: "@Second Generation D, are you suggesting we give the loan sharks a run for their money?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Don’t treat missed profits as losses; focus on what you have."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll be responsible for figuring out how to expand our portfolio.”
 

 
Wei Zekai shared his grand ambitions in the group, and Tong Zhao casually chimed in, which had a greater impact on the members than even their own parents' advice.
 

 
It wasn’t solely about the money.
 

 
One major reason was the offline gathering where they decided to establish Ze Shan group. Tong Zhao had momentarily tapped into the spirit of a rally for a survival organization in a dystopian setting—she could have easily been a successful network marketer, inspiring these sheltered young heirs to work fervently for her.
 

 
Additionally, this was their first successful venture that yielded significant returns.
 

 
Their families had always doubted their intelligence, talent, and dedication, believing they weren't cut out for business. This group of second-generation heirs lacked nothing in terms of basic needs and always aimed for the best.
 

 
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, their pursuits revolved around socializing, respect, and self-actualization.
 

 
Tong Zhao managed to satisfy all three desires at once, making them willingly follow her.
 

 
While their earlier involvement had a playful aspect, the first round of profits genuinely astonished them. They collectively invested five million (mostly from Wei’s allowance, which he later topped up), and they had already recouped their investment. The total valuation of the projects they invested in reached eight figures… this part couldn’t be liquidated yet, but it was sustainable unless the companies bought back their shares at a high price.
 

 
Even if they intended to, Tong Zhao wouldn’t sell now.
 

 
She extended a helping hand during the companies' toughest times; she wasn’t there for charity. She planned to hold long-term and consider selling at the right moment to maximize profits.
 

 
The current profits looked impressive but were merely small gains compared to the ongoing potential.
 

 
It was like going back to "Sword Three" to speculate on limited-edition fashion—what seemed exaggerated at hundreds could later reach thousands.
 

 
Boss Kai: "Listen to my brother!”
 

 
Boss Kai: "By the way, bro, about the 'Excellent Companion Learning' project you tasked me with, Boss Chen has added a ton of details based on your instructions. We’re optimistic about this project, but we need more funding for promotion…"
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered.
 

 
The concept of companionship and training had only gained popularity in recent years, and it was still a blue ocean market.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’m very optimistic about this project. Keep investing, and let me know if you need more. It has to be executed well."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…I was just giving some suggestions, how did it turn into orders?"
 

 
At that moment, a colleague who had attended the meeting with Boss Chen jumped in to report—
 

 
Wei Zekai was serious about executing Tong Zhao's directives, turning the unseen strategist into an untouchable investment guru. After hearing about the "ton of details" from Wei, Boss Chen not only was brought back on track but also illuminated many profitable paths that others might not have seen. He had studied for a long time but hadn’t figured it out until now!
 

 
After all, some conclusions can only be reached through trial and error.
 

 
Boss Chen immediately regarded this strategist from Ze Shan as a remarkable figure, akin to Zhuge Liang.
 

 
Considering Wei’s age and background, this strategist must have been sent by the Wei family to safeguard their only son, conjuring an image of a well-dressed elder with well-maintained salt-and-pepper hair.
 

 
The same situation repeatedly occurred when the second-generation heirs went to oversee these companies.
 

 
They feared they weren’t authoritative enough.
 

 
After all, they were just following Sister Zhao’s lead.
 

 
But in the eyes of these smaller companies, they arrived with substantial investments, and every opinion they voiced was seen as highly enlightening… clearly, they were big shots! Young? Carrying documents? That meant their unseen backer was incredibly impressive!
 

 
Under the invisible pressure from strategist Tong Zhao, the finances of these companies dared not engage in any underhanded dealings.
 

 
Because of the profits, they didn’t even think about schemes to defraud investors or run away—
 

 
Why would someone who successfully started a business and is earning steadily want to flee?
 

 
Working for oneself is the true essence of being an employee!
 

 
If one were to delve a little deeper, Ze Shan group seemed almost like a mysterious cult.
 

 
What Tong Zhao said became their belief.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most devoted archbishop, holding the most practical resources.
 

 
The other second-generation heirs acted as bishops, working to develop followers.
 

 
Every company owner who received investment and guidance from Ze Shan became a devoted believer after seeing substantial profits.
 

 
The colleagues pieced together how the strategist was viewed by these smaller companies.
 

 
Whenever Ze Shan was mentioned, a wise, aged silhouette appeared in their minds—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I suspect there’s a problem here.JPG]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, I won't manage this for you; just make sure it’s done well.]
 

 
The second-generation heirs all promptly sent acknowledgment emojis, behaving obediently.
 

 
…
 

 
The "Good Sisters" controversy did not cease with Xu Zhu’s announcement of her withdrawal from the entertainment industry.
 

 
At first, audiences of "Star Selection Girl" suspected that Xu Zhu's debut was rigged, uncovering her connections and the Tong family. Tong Zhenming’s company was suddenly thrust into the public eye, and angry fans created a PR crisis for the company—friends who had helped arrange Xu Zhu’s debut no longer wanted to associate with him.
 

 
Netizens began to focus on what kind of life Tong Zhao had at home.
 

 
Dramatically, fans of "Heartless Tribulation" discovered the film's submitted documents.
 

 
Such documents are available for public scrutiny through the film association, completely transparent, but generally, only dedicated fans pay attention. The documents clearly stated whether lead actress Tong Zhao had applied for pain exemption.
 

 
…
 

 
"Shocking My Whole Family: Tong Zhao didn't apply for pain exemption in 'Heartless Tribulation'???"
 

 
The main post immediately garnered significant attention.
 

 
Similar screenshots circulated widely on Weibo.
 

 
Some netizens questioned why she would put herself through this, given that the memories recovered from the holographic chamber could be painfully distressing, potentially leaving psychological scars.
 

 
However, the top comment from a fan offered a different perspective: [Applying for pain exemption mainly serves to give the protagonist an advantage; after all, the subconscious has a natural tendency to seek benefit and avoid harm. Not having pain exemption could enhance the actor's performance, though it might affect realism.]
 

 
Even without pain exemption, Tong Zhao's subconscious was just as ruthless with herself.
 

 
A young fan advised Tong Zhao and her manager on Weibo to arrange for a psychologist for their sister, fearing she might have self-destructive tendencies.
 

 
Seeing this, Tong Zhao felt compelled to respond.
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV:
 

 
"My mental state is very healthy.
 

 
I'm used to pain and prefer not to apply for exemption, as it could affect my subconscious performance."
 

 
Tong Zhao managed her Weibo personally.
 

 
She felt it was impossible to make any inappropriate comments that could lead to her being blacklisted. She didn't want her fans to only see a Weibo filled with promotional ads and business selfies... While she couldn’t respond to everyone’s affection, she at least wanted the few ways fans could "connect" with her to feel more genuine.
 

 
Other than that, she had nothing more to say.
 

 
Public curiosity would never be satisfied.
 

 
To respond to everything was impractical—first, there was no time, and second, it would lower her status.
 

 
“I’ll just be myself; let them think what they want about the rest,” she told her manager.
 

 
“So confident,” Sister Chu said, giving her a thumbs-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, steering the conversation back to work: “Isn’t the next variety show about survival on a deserted island? Not applying for pain exemption could be used for publicity; if others do it, I won’t.”
 

 
Sister Chu glanced at Tong Zhao’s light-hearted Weibo post.
 

 
She then reflected on Tong Zhao's comment about using it for publicity, which had a very commercial flavor and felt quite grounded. She couldn’t help but feel a bit dazed: “That angle could indeed be expanded, but you’re only a guest for two days; we should first decide what major project to take next…”
 

 
Another director wanted her to audition.
 

 
Of course, given her current status, not everyone could afford her, but several prominent names still required Tong Zhao to be on her toes.
 

 
The conversations between stars and their managers remained unknown to the outside world.
 

 
Fans, on one hand, felt reassured knowing that their sister’s mental health was in good shape.
 

 
On the other hand, netizens focused on Tong Zhao's comment about being "used to pain."
 

 
What situation would lead someone to become accustomed to pain?
 

 
Considering the previously uncovered details about the Tong family, Tong Zhenming clearly didn’t care for his daughter and favored boys over girls.
 

 
Some netizens suggested that "Tong Zhao might have experienced domestic violence," which quickly gained many supporters—if she hadn’t been beaten growing up, how could she be so accustomed to pain?
 

 
To be fair, Tong Zhenming had never physically abused her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao excelled in her studies and was a source of pride for her father among peers. Other than the disappointment of not being a son to carry on the family name, she was already a very perfect daughter.
 

 
But why would Tong Zhao step up to defend him?
 

 
It was impossible; let the netizens speculate.
 

 
Emotional abuse is still abuse.
 

 
The psychological impact and torment inflicted by Tong Zhenming on her were far worse than a physical beating.
 

 
The reputations of Tong Zhenming and Xu Zhu as a dysfunctional father-daughter pair had soured. Xu Zhu had thought that by retreating from the industry, she could live quietly as a pampered young lady, but Tong Zhenming, disregarding her feelings, cut off her allowance, telling her to reflect on herself.
 

 
And this time, it wasn’t just her.
 

 
Xu’s mother, who had recently given birth to a son, also faced a downgrade in lifestyle.
 

 
Conflicts arose between mother and daughter; Xu's mother felt she shouldn’t argue with her father, as the whole family relied on him, while Xu Zhu believed her own mother didn’t see her as a person.
 

 
Without money, life became unbearable. She couldn’t go out shopping to vent and was stuck at home.
 

 
What entertainment was there at home?
 

 
Every time she logged onto Weibo, she was met with insults. Her account had been reclaimed by the company, which only became a platform for netizens and fans to criticize her, almost hoping to dig up a scandal. Fans who once treated her like a little princess were now expressing their disappointment in every word.
 

 
Xu Zhu felt that life had become incredibly difficult.
 

 
If she knew the truth behind this downgrade in lifestyle, it would be even more unbearable.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was no longer generous to his wife and daughter, not for their education, but because he genuinely had little liquidity left. He was already overwhelmed with work, scrambling for connections for the company, and now that people knew it was him, their attitudes shifted subtly.
 

 
Some old-school businessmen didn’t see it as a problem to be harsh with their children.
 

 
The issue was that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu, in terms of both appearance and achievement, were worlds apart.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's silence in the face of this slander was like stamping “fool” on his forehead.
 

 
A boss who discarded something precious for a trivial gain couldn’t possibly have good investment instincts.
 

 
Considering Tong Zhao's relationship with Wei Zekai, she might even end up being called Mrs. Wei in the future.
 

 
It wasn’t worth it for Tong Zhenming, marked as a fool, to offend the Wei family.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai repeatedly declared that Tong Zhao was his good brother, who could say for sure?
 

 
Moreover—
 

 
After Ze Shan group turned a profit, Wei Zekai returned home triumphantly, turning the family dinner into his performance review. As he talked enthusiastically, clearly and understandably, Wei’s father realized that he had made money, and quite a bit at that.
 

 
Here, “quite a bit” referred not to the amount but to the return on investment.
 

 
Once he finished, Wei’s father surprisingly praised him: “Well done! If you earn five more times, you can make up for your past losses.”
 

 
“……”
 

 
Damn.
 

 
The family didn't want to constrain the child and initially provided him with sufficient funds.
 

 
The losses were quite spectacular.
 

 
Wei Zekai pouted for a moment but quickly rallied, saying, "Don't worry, breaking even is just a small goal for now; in the future, I will lead Ze Shan to grow big and strong."
 

 
As he said this, he raised the corners of his mouth, his handsome face full of youthful vigor.
 

 
Seeing him take a big step from zero to one, the elders didn’t discourage him.
 

 
After dinner, Wei Father called him into the study.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit anxious; after all, he had often been scolded in the study. Every time there was a loss in investment, he would be lectured for two or three hours, and his father would end with, "Maybe you should just find a job."
 

 
Actually, Wei Father was hoping he would work at the family group.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai, having read too many web novels, panicked and thought his father wanted him to work on an assembly line at an electronics factory.
 

 
That time was a low point in his life.
 

 
Now, stepping into the study, he secretly encouraged himself—
 

 
He was making money.
 

 
He needed to be confident!
 

 
"Sit."
 

 
As soon as he walked in, Wei Father patted the sofa, motioning for him to sit down.
 

 
Once he obediently settled, his father got straight to the point: "How much of this was taught to you by someone else?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wei Father had navigated the business world for many years, and with only one son to watch over, it was easy to read Wei Zekai like an open book. When it came to feelings, though he claimed to see Tong Zhao as just a good brother, Wei Father could tell it was far from the truth.
 

 
But why remind his son?
 

 
After all, he had faced his own setbacks in love, and his son shouldn't be spared.
 

 
"About seventy percent," Wei Zekai admitted, realizing he couldn't hide it from his father. "The 'Little Lamb Playmate' project and those others were my responsibility. I didn't want to say too much at home; Tong Zhao asked me to organize the information and bring it back to discuss, saying it was to reassure you."
 

 
Tong Zhao.
 

 
Hearing that name again, Wei Father was a bit surprised.
 

 
In his mind, she was a woman so beautiful that it overshadowed other qualities.
 

 
"Then why didn't you mention her earlier?" Wei Father asked, a hint of displeasure in his tone.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew he had invested a lot of money in Ze Shan.
 

 
In terms of funding, he indeed held the major stake.
 

 
However, some of the precise and seasoned decisions mentioned earlier, along with the reporting approach, were definitely not his own ideas.
 

 
While it’s important to polish one’s own brand in business, taking too much credit is also a major taboo.
 

 
"I want to invite Tong Zhao over to play,"
 

 
Wei Zekai was puzzled: "After reviewing the materials and reports I organized, she polished them up and told me to remember my lines, saying not to mention her and just act like these ideas were all mine."
 

 
Wei Father understood; she was trying to make a good impression on him.
 

 
But since Xiao Kai was an only child, he had no motivation to compete with siblings...
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao's image in Wei Father's mind shifted from a particularly shrewd and beautiful woman to a girl who really liked his son. "You should treat her well, you fool."
 

 
He patted his son’s head.
 

 
After that lesson, he asked Wei Zekai to share his thoughts and questions about managing the company.
 

 
That night, after tucking himself in, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but message Tong Zhao on WeChat: [My dad thinks you’re really good to me.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Did Uncle find out? Well, it’s hard to keep anything from him.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I treat you well because you treat me well.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Moreover, my kindness isn’t blind; I believe you’re qualified to be my partner and have the talent to manage a company... I want to act, I enjoy acting, and I like leaving behind various works that showcase different sides of me. Hearing discussions about the characters I’ve played makes me happy. When my time is limited and I want everything, I can only collaborate with others.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [They are my partners, and you are my collaborator.]
 

 
After sending that, Tong Zhao said it was too late and she was going to bed.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied with an "OK" emoji and didn’t message her again to disturb her.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other that as soon as Tong Zhao sent him a message, he could instantly hear her slightly cold and lazy voice in his mind. So, that lengthy text felt like it came with its own sound effects for him.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit restless under the covers, pressing on his chest where his heart was and feeling a little excited.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to make a lot of money, wanted to invest everywhere, and wanted to grow the company strong…
 

 
That was what he wanted too; they shared a common goal.
 

 
Yes, they were partners and lifelong good brothers.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly laughed under the covers.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't dare to go online and scroll through Weibo, because everywhere she looked, there were insults directed at her.
 

 
Originally, a small-time star from a talent show would be virtually ignored online, and after a couple of days of criticism, it would die down.
 

 
The problem was that Tong Zhao, who had recently had a conflict with her, had become incredibly popular.
 

 
She was so famous that her promotional image for "Heartless Tribulation" featured her in a flowing white outfit, holding a long sword. Even those who hadn't seen the movie could recognize her. Her elegant features were hard to reconcile with her softer, delicate persona from "Sea King Kill."
 

 
"Is Tong Zhao's multifaceted subconscious not enough to explain her? Could she possibly have split personality disorder?"
 

 
[Don’t joke about it; there hasn't been a successful example of split personalities portraying different roles in film history.]
 

 
[That's because they aren't all handsome or beautiful / doge/doge.]
 

 
[Instead of wondering why there are so many facets to her subconscious, I'm more concerned about Zhao Zhao's mental health!]
 

 
This was the mainstream view among her fans.
 

 
They believed what Tong Zhao said; after all, each of her personalities had a similar, stubborn core. The essence was still her, just painted in different colors by her tumultuous life experiences...
 

 
“Miss Tong, please have a seat,”
 

 
In a consultation room at the headquarters of the Instinct Film Association, Dr. Gu, a refined gentleman, sat waiting.
 

 
Unlike an ordinary psychological clinic, there was a white holographic imaging chamber in the corner of the room.
 

 
Dr. Gu's gentle eyes, framed by silver-rimmed glasses, looked toward his first special guest of the day. “Would you like something to drink? The examination you’ll undergo will last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, depending on your performance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's unique subconscious had caught the association's attention.
 

 
The Instinct Film Association deals with the subconscious, which differs slightly from the needs of traditional psychologists. Therefore, doctors in this field require an additional license, and top talent is unique to the association. If this emerging actress truly has psychological issues, the association will provide assistance right away, rather than impose sanctions.
 

 
After all, even if she were a patient with schizophrenia, she wouldn't be breaking any laws.
 

 
The production team is willing to work with her, and she still has roles to play.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously declined an examination, but after learning more about the process this time, she didn't want to raise further doubts or cause concern for her genuinely caring friends, so she agreed to find time for it—
 

 
The association has a great reputation in the industry and stands by the actors.
 

 
After she refused the examination last time, some senior colleagues thought she was being cautious and had even comforted and advised her.
 

 
“Once the examination is complete, if everything is fine, can I post the results on Weibo?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
Dr. Gu paused for a moment before smiling. “Miss Tong, are you worried about your fans?”
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
“Of course, Miss Tong, you can think of it as filming a short video for your fans,” Dr. Gu said with a smile. “Actually, I’m one of your fans too.”
 

 
“Great! What do I need to do?”
 

 
Dr. Gu clasped his hands and said gently, “Once you connect to the holographic filming pod, you don’t need to play anyone else; just be yourself.”
 

 
Tong Zhao paused, then jokingly replied with a double entendre, “I haven’t been myself in a long time.”
 

 
“Well, being a big star means you can’t help it.”
 

 
Dr. Gu assumed she meant that stars have to wear a persona when facing the public.
# Chapter62
In the office of the Instinct Film Association.
 

 
"Sorry, I was a bit delayed."
 

 
The association's evaluator walked in and explained the upcoming examination to Tong Zhao: "This is a brand-new medical technology primarily used to understand a patient's psychological state. You can think of it as a CT scan for mental health."
 

 
Tong Zhao understood.
 

 
In medicine, a significant challenge in doctor-patient communication is that the results from consultations are not always accurate. Sometimes, patients may feel too embarrassed to speak up or fall into cognitive traps. For example, when told to fast before a test, a patient might think that drinking a bowl of chicken soup or millet porridge doesn’t count as eating—subjectively not lying, but objectively misleading the doctor.
 

 
Physiological illnesses can be easily identified with a CT scan; tumors cannot be hidden under skin fat. However, psychological ailments have traditionally relied on doctors building trust with patients, who might not even understand themselves.
 

 
With the rise of Instinct Film, the technology has advanced rapidly, propelled by profit, making psychological therapy more accessible.
 

 
"We've both signed confidentiality agreements. Once the examination results are ready, we will provide you with the original recording. If you consent, the association will keep a copy."
 

 
The evaluator made a routine reminder, addressing any concerns: "After all, even if it's just a simulation, many people are reluctant to let others see their inner world."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded to indicate understanding.
 

 
"You’re being too serious," Dr. Gu said with a smile as he turned the tablet to show Tong Zhao three screenshots of rooms. "These are the examination results of three actors who were my clients. They all enjoyed it and even shared their results on Weibo for their fans to see."
 

 
The three rooms included a princess room filled with pink toys, a Scandinavian-style living room, and a library surrounded by bookshelves.
 

 
They all looked quite positive, and Tong Zhao guessed the artists released them after discussing with their companies. Naturally, seeing her inner self align with her expectations made her happy.
 

 
"If..."
 

 
Dr. Gu smiled again, reassuring her: "The confidentiality of the results depends entirely on your personal wishes. Even if the company requests, we won’t disclose anything."
 

 
...
 

 
As Tong Zhao lay down in the white holographic chamber and closed her eyes, a familiar wave of drowsiness washed over her.
 

 
It was worth coming today.
 

 
She thought hazily, also curious about what her subconscious would be like now.
 

 
What was special this time was that, without character background settings or memory inputs, she experienced minimal discomfort, as if she naturally slipped into a gentle dream.
 

 
...
 

 
Once it was confirmed that the guest had entered the holographic scan, the evaluator turned and asked, "What do you think of Tong Zhao's situation?”
 

 
"Tong Zhao's subconscious richness should be greater than that of the average person, which allows her to deliver nuanced performances," Dr. Gu said, filled with admiration.
 

 
He truly was a fan of Tong Zhao, not just for her looks—perhaps due to his profession, he paid special attention to the subconscious traits of instinct film actors. "I suspect her palace of consciousness has more than one room."
 

 
According to past records stored in the association, older actors with richer experiences tend to have larger palaces of consciousness. Even within the same house, the layout and style can vary greatly. There was an established actor who sought help from the association due to psychological issues—
 

 
In a quaint entrance lit by incense, the living room resembled a rundown old house, with dusty windows and a mountain of greasy dishes in the kitchen. Inside the bedroom was a peculiar bed with a cage underneath.
 

 
This type of bed was meant for a certain indescribable group.
 

 
The actor opened the cage door and curled up inside, satisfied.
 

 
The bed was empty except for the trophies he had once earned.
 

 
"You think too highly of Tong Zhao," the evaluator remarked skeptically. "I admit her subconscious expressiveness and resilience are much stronger than current young actors, but she’s still young. It’s likely just one room with a few more things in it."
 

 
Out of professional habit, Dr. Gu didn’t refute him, simply waiting for the monitor to light up.
 

 
It was pitch black.
 

 
"Is it broken? Not connected?"
 

 
Just as the evaluator was about to troubleshoot, the lights came on.
 

 
Contrary to their expectations, Tong Zhao's palace of consciousness appeared quite simple.
 

 
Displayed on the screen was an empty, off-white circular platform, with a single chair in the center.
 

 
It was a very ordinary chair, one that could be bought on Taobao for just 9.99 yuan with free shipping.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the chair, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
"So this is what you call a higher subconscious richness?" The evaluator chuckled, mocking his colleague.
 

 
It seemed rather mundane.
 

 
But the next moment, as she awoke, doors began to emerge from the off-white walls like relief carvings. Each door was spaced about two meters apart, arranged neatly like a poorly managed rental unit, with doors stretching endlessly around Tong Zhao, as if mysterious monsters were about to leap out from behind them, ready to peel her thin frame and devour her.
 

 
The evaluator fell silent.
 

 
Not because he was embarrassed, but because the environment felt unsettling, reminiscent of a horror film.
 

 
Could a psychologically healthy person's palace of consciousness really look like this?
 

 
"Okay, let’s begin the instructions."
 

 
The evaluator operated the scanning chamber, inputting a psychological suggestion for Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I’ve lost something, but I don’t know where it’s hidden in the house."
 

 
This would prompt her to explore her palace of consciousness.
 

 
As the thought formed in her mind, Tong Zhao stood up from the chair and opened the first door…
 

 
A light mist poured out from the door, revealing a resplendent interior of a palace.
 

 
To their astonishment, reclining on an intricately carved bed was a beautiful young girl dressed in vibrant clothes!
 

 
Both of them widened their eyes in shock.
 

 
Typically, there wouldn’t be other living beings in a palace of consciousness. If there were, they would appear in the form of inanimate objects, like poorly made dolls, a vase with a name tag, or a human statue... Instinct films rarely allow for the spontaneous creation of another living person.
 

 
A whole team of modelers could labor tirelessly to create majestic landscapes.
 

 
Even a small stream would leave traces to follow.
 

 
But human thought cannot be constructed in such a way.
 

 
Even the top modeling experts can only create the appearance of a person; they cannot conjure a living human being in the holographic world.
 

 
That’s why a large number of temporary actors are needed.
 

 
"Calm down and think of Han Zhi from 'Sea King Killer,'" Dr. Gu offered an explanation. "Her subconscious is quite unique, which is why she can take on such diverse roles. This girl should be… the favored concubine from 'The Chronicles of Ming Emperor'?"
 

 
...
 

 
"Zhao Zhao,"
 

 
the vibrant girl turned her head, revealing a youthful face that looked about six years younger than the current Tong Zhao, with a delicate flower ornament on her forehead. "Are you here to play with me?"
 

 
In the ancient setting, Tong Zhao had entered the palace at a young age.
 

 
She quickly gained favor, surrounded by young girls, and had enjoyed years of privilege. Eventually, she left as the beloved of the young emperor after completing her mission.
 

 
In her memory, Concubine Chen looked just like this.
 

 
"I’ve lost something. I wanted to see if it might be in your palace."
 

 
"Were you not specifically looking for me?"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Concubine Chen became displeased.
 

 
She waved her hand, her delicate, snow-white arm adorned with gold bangles and silver bells that jingled with her movement. With a sense of entitlement, she ordered Tong Zhao, "Come here and give me a hug."
 

 
Despite still being considered a young girl in modern times, she exuded a vibrant charm.
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed quite accommodating, walking over to embrace her for a moment before stepping back when she felt satisfied.
 

 
She didn't find what she was looking for in this room.
 

 
The next room was a cluttered storage space filled with all sorts of items.
 

 
Dr. Gu focused his attention.
 

 
No, in the corner of the room was a nylon bed, so old and shabby that it blended completely with the background at first glance. Sitting on the nylon bed was a woman in a tank top and shorts, about 28 years old, with a more mature face marked by a scar running from her left cheek to her nose.
 

 
The woman seemed completely unconcerned, playing with a Swiss Army knife.
 

 
The knife flipped skillfully between her fingers.
 

 
The "storage room" contained survival supplies that most people could hardly imagine. If the room's owner lived in peaceful times, they would likely be teased for being overly prepared or a survivalist. The only light source in the room was a dim oil lamp beside the nylon bed, softening her strikingly aggressive beauty.
 

 
Duan Ge smiled when she saw Tong Zhao. "What a rare guest."
 

 
"I'm looking for something," Tong Zhao replied.
 

 
"You’d better hope you never need anything from here," Duan Ge said, concern evident in her gaze. "Are you feeling okay?"
 

 
With that, she stepped down from the nylon bed and embraced Tong Zhao tightly.
 

 
Duan Ge was a head taller than Tong Zhao, her muscular arms clearly defined.
 

 
The powerful hug provided a sense of security.
 

 
While hugging Concubine Chen earlier, Tong Zhao had felt like a big sister, but now, wrapped in Duan Ge's arms, she felt small like a child.
 

 
"Good girl, good girl," Duan Ge cooed.
 

 
Tong Zhao tilted her head back in protest. "I'm not a kid anymore!"
 

 
"In my eyes, you’re still a baby."
 

 
Her protest was futile; not only was she hugged, but Duan Ge also playfully ruffled her hair. Only after Duan Ge felt satisfied did she let her go.
 

 
"Who are these people?" the evaluator asked, puzzled.
 

 
"They might be different phases of Tong Zhao's self-image," Dr. Gu rationalized. "We all had that as kids, right? Imagining ourselves as masked warriors, chosen ones, or magical girls, and then dreaming that we really looked like that."
 

 
The evaluator asked, "What are Diga and masked warriors?”
 

 
Dr. Gu said, "…Forget it."
 

 
Tong Zhao almost escaped from Duan Ge's room.
 

 
Her fair cheeks were slightly flushed from the hug. After closing the door, she angrily wiped her face with the back of her hand and kicked Duan Ge's door as she turned to leave.
 

 
"Why are you so angry?"
 

 
A male voice came from behind her, and Tong Zhao turned around.
 

 
Han Zhi was smiling at her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Wait! Does her palace of consciousness operate like a shared rental? Is that even reasonable? Can her mind really hold that many fully developed characters? They can even engage in logical, peaceful conversations..."
 

 
While the evaluator's worldview shattered, he asked Dr. Gu, "Does this count as schizophrenia?"
 

 
"Your understanding of schizophrenia might be based on artistic representations," Dr. Gu replied.
 

 
The evaluator said, "Got it, multiple personalities aren’t this exaggerated."
 

 
Dr. Gu nodded, "I can’t say it’s completely out of the question."
 

 
While such cases are rare, they don't fall into illegal territory. Dr. Gu was more concerned about Tong Zhao’s physical health—one's brain functions like a hard drive, with a limited capacity. Even if no one knows the exact limit, having more than ten doors in this scenario, each potentially housing a "Tong Zhao," would be a heavy burden on her mind.
 

 
A rather bizarre image popped into Dr. Gu's head.
 

 
In her palace of consciousness, Tong Zhao could hold an "AKB48" general election and a "Produce 101" audition all by herself. Can you play mahjong alone? Sorry, I can complete an audition all by myself!
 

 
Well, Dr. Gu’s concerns didn’t materialize.
 

 
Besides Han Zhi, Tong Zhao only encountered two other people. The remaining doors, no matter how she twisted the knobs, were locked.
 

 
"Should we give her another suggestion?" the evaluator asked Dr. Gu.
 

 
"No, that’s enough."
 

 
Dr. Gu said.
 

 
After receiving Dr. Gu's permission, the evaluator gently extracted Tong Zhao's subconscious from the holographic scan. At the same time, Tong Zhao, lying in the chamber, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
Unlike the slight headache she usually felt after filming, this time she felt refreshed.
 

 
After sitting up and facing the two, she asked, "How long was I out?"
 

 
"Fifteen minutes," Dr. Gu paused. "How do you feel now? If you start to feel any headaches, I recommend going to the next room for some observation. Some professional therapists can help you relax through massage."
 

 
Unlike filming a movie, this examination was like a self-reflection.
 

 
Not everyone can walk away feeling comfortable.
 

 
Of course, it’s generally not a serious issue.
 

 
Dr. Gu had seen a client who had a breakdown, crying in her room and tearing apart a teddy bear that represented her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
"I don't need that for now."
 

 
"You can take a look at the recordings first."
 

 
Dr. Gu turned the tablet around so Tong Zhao could watch the replay.
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao saw herself interacting with her other personas in visual form. Although she could talk to them anytime in her mind, it lacked the physicality of a hug. During lonely times, she could only lie in bed hugging a long pillow.
 

 
It turned out she had always wanted to embrace herself in her subconscious.
 

 
The usually aloof Tong Zhao felt a bit embarrassed in front of others.
 

 
Concubine Chen found it hard to accept: [Why is this side of me so childish? I should be the one hugging you.]
 

 
Brother Duan, having had the rare opportunity to hug Tong Zhao, was eager to recover that brief memory.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao did not exhibit any antisocial tendencies during the examination, nor did she show any self-destructive inclinations rumored due to a lack of pain perception, Dr. Gu issued her a mental health certificate but reminded her:
 

 
"I'm not sure if you have a split personality, because in past clients with similar mental disorders, awareness of other personalities often leads to aggressive behavior... A body is like a ship; it only needs one captain, and everyone wants to give orders."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "But I don't."
 

 
"Right, you don't, so I think you can't be classified as having schizophrenia. You are quite whole," Dr. Gu affirmed her statement before gently suggesting, "If each door holds a different version of you, my advice is not to open too many doors."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused.
 

 
Seeing her hesitation, Dr. Gu chose not to press the topic further and instead discussed the promising box office trends of "Heartless Tribulation," even asking her for a photo and autograph with a fan-like enthusiasm. Tong Zhao was glad to change the subject and left after taking the picture. Before she walked away, she turned back and sincerely said:
 

 
"I'll think carefully about whether to open the next door. Thank you for your reminder."
 

 
Dr. Gu is a well-known scholar in the industry and holds significant standing within the Film Association. Without knowing of the system's existence, he gave advice similar to what the system had suggested—
 

 
The system had also indicated that with her current mental strength, she shouldn’t forcibly open too many doors.
 

 
However, not opening those doors meant some experiences and memories from certain worlds would be forever forgotten.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Don’t push yourself.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I know.]
 

 
Stepping out of the association's building, the flow of traffic and heat hit her face.
 

 
By the side of a minivan parked across the street stood her assistant, waving at her. The mundane reality felt like an anchor, stabilizing her steps as she quietly said:
 

 
"Becoming whole is everyone’s wish. If I can't even remember my past self, then the Tong Zhao of that time would be left there forever, right? I don’t want that."
 

 
Dr. Gu mentioned that many with split personalities display strong aggression toward their other selves.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the opposite.
 

 
She loved herself too much.
 

 
To the world, a small Tong Zhao was insignificant, and a brief segment of her long life was even more trivial.
 

 
Yet she would take on more instinctive films, exercising and expanding her mental strength time and again until she could open the next door.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Please wait for me a bit longer.]
 

 
…
 

 
In her mind, the other personas, recalling the examination, complained: [Tong Zhao just pushes herself too much; no wonder we all want to hug her in our subconscious.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I hugged her the hardest.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [I want to hug her too.]
 

 
…
 

 
After discussing with her manager, Tong Zhao decided to hand over the fifteen-minute video to a professional for review and editing, removing any unnecessary and redundant shots.
 

 
Fortunately, she had many skilled colleagues in her WeChat contacts, so she posted a status.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Does anyone know how to edit short videos and do post-production? Paid help needed.]
 

 
It was rare for Sister Zhao to post, and soon there was a long string of likes and comments, including some post-editing professionals she had previously added.
 

 
Just as she was about to pick someone familiar and reliable, she spotted a particularly familiar name—
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Am I qualified?]
 

 
Post-Production A: 【……】
 

 
Post-Production B: 【…… oh wow】
 

 
This was Shi Qianqiu!
 

 
His editing skills were top-notch, and every film project he worked on was a hit.
 

 
Back in school, he was said to have a million-follower fan account for film-related content, which was his underground alias. He gained fame for skillfully editing Harry Potter and Qingwen into an outrageous couple, but he never admitted it, making it an open secret in the industry.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wasn’t qualified, who could claim they were?
 

 
As soon as he applied, other editors felt sidelined.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it both amusing and frustrating, and immediately messaged him: [I can't afford you, you're too expensive.]
 

 
She couldn’t even imagine his fees.
 

 
[I don’t charge. I’m just bored, and my hands are itching. Is what you want to edit too troublesome? If there’s room for creativity, I’d love to try; if it’s dull, then forget it.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was very straightforward, which was the kind of person Tong Zhao enjoyed dealing with.
 

 
She sent him the short video: [This was filmed when I went to the association for an examination.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’ll take it.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You haven’t even watched it yet?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [A video with you in it will definitely not be boring.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was pleasantly surprised by the compliment.
 

 
His way of flattering people was unique, often leaving them speechless, with Xu Zhu and Chen Zhuzhi being perfect examples. But when he complimented her, he acted quite normally. After agreeing to edit, he went quiet, and Tong Zhao didn’t rush him. Meanwhile, her manager checked in: “Have you found a post-production editor? If not, I can recommend someone.”
 

 
“I found one.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked, “When will it be done?”
 

 
“I don’t know; I’ll leave it to him.”
 

 
"Who has such an attitude?" Sister Chu frowned, worried that Tong Zhao might be misled. Her own pampered artist always seemed so obedient. Despite Tong Zhao being fierce with outsiders, she was especially kind to her assistants and other behind-the-scenes staff; she wouldn’t lose her temper over small mistakes.
 

 
Which post-production editor had the audacity to act like this with Sister Zhao?
 

 
Tong Zhao, sipping her warm water slowly, mentioned a name: "Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
"……"
 

 
Sister Chu covered her face and retreated in defeat.
 

 
They would just have to wait; Shi Qianqiu was more of an artist than a worker.
 

 
In art, taking time to produce quality work was normal.
 

 
After getting Shi Qianqiu’s consent, Tong Zhao’s manager took their half-true collaboration news to market, capitalizing on the popularity of "The Heartless Tribulation" to elevate Tong Zhao's status…
 

 
To become a big star, a solid body of work was essential, and marketing could accelerate that process.
 

 
How to convince the public that she was a big star?
 

 
Collaborate frequently with major directors and screenwriters; have box office hits; hold high-end endorsements; and receive numerous positive reviews… Once the hype was in place, she could ride the wave.
 

 
Unexpectedly, after a week, Shi Qianqiu sent two finished products to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【One is just a simple edit.】
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【The original footage was good, so I added some extra material and edited it into an experimental short film. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to release it; consider it a gift for you to enjoy.】
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was preparing with her manager to head to the deserted island for promotional filming, so they watched it together.
 

 
They had both seen the original footage, which was an unremarkable fan-made short.
 

 
Fans would naturally be happy to see their sister in different styles, but it didn’t tell much of a story.
 

 
Tong Zhao sought a post-production editor just to make it more concise and add suitable background music.
 

 
In the end, Shi Qianqiu delivered a microfilm.
 

 
After watching the film, Chu Jie turned to her in a daze and said, "This... isn't cheap, right?”
# Chapter63
The two of them skeptically watched it again.
 

 
Since Shi Qianqiu said he only added a bit of material, Tong Zhao and her agent initially didn’t think too much of it and just watched it as a routine check.
 

 
—“I’m looking for something.”
 

 
—“Where is it?”
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard typing, these two lines of text gradually appeared on the dark screen, voiced by Tong Zhao with a hint of confusion and hesitation. She had just entered the holographic filming and received the evaluator’s suggestion, making her tone especially uncertain.
 

 
Using these two lines as a lead immediately piqued the audience’s curiosity about why Tong Zhao was showing a vulnerable side.
 

 
Tong Zhao and her agent had seen the original footage.
 

 
The suspense created by Shi Qianqiu was ineffective for them; they naturally assumed the next scene would be Tong Zhao's consciousness palace…
 

 
However, it wasn’t.
 

 
When the dark curtain was lifted, it turned out to be a scene from "Countdown 72 Hours," where Tong Zhao played Feng Yanqi, showing her looking around in a weapon shop for suitable firearms, highlighting the theme of "searching."
 

 
—“At any cost.”
 

 
The tone of this line was particularly high and aloof, carrying a ruthless determination that indicated no matter the means, even sacrificing everyone to achieve the goal was acceptable. Outside of the scene, Tong Zhao thought about it and concluded it was neither from "72 Hours" nor from the inspection results.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [From "Sea King Kill."]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [...He even watched that!]
 

 
The beautiful woman was speechless.
 

 
Following that ruthless line about "at any cost," Feng Yanqi's accelerated beatdown of the robbers began, with each strike perfectly timed to the background music's rhythm, creating a strong sense of impact. In the frame, she appeared as a fierce and stunning female warrior. The camera then zoomed in on her plucking bullets with tweezers, before suddenly closing in on a gruesome wound, taking up the entire shot. This was followed by Feng Yanqi, with a high level of intensity, storming into the research facility, shooting through hordes of zombies and engaging in close combat, ultimately collapsing from exhaustion.
 

 
"This transition!" Sister Chu exclaimed again.
 

 
"The fan-made vibe is so strong; that million-follower editor on Bilibili must be him." As Tong Zhao prepared for "Heartless Tribulation," she wanted to learn more about the director and proactively looked up news related to Shi Qianqiu, which included this information.
 

 
In the film, Feng Yanqi collapsed, closing her eyes.
 

 
Those who have seen "72 Hours" know that she gets the antidote and won't die.
 

 
However, at the moment she shut her eyes, the sound of a door opening echoed.
 

 
Behind the door was a shabby old storage room, filled to the brim with clutter.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, while the space was cramped, the items were organized in a very orderly manner and not messy at all. However, it was still not a comfortable room to stay in, and the nylon bed tucked in the corner only deepened this sense of discomfort.
 

 
On the bed, Duan Ge (brother) looked like a more mature Feng Yanqi, her face showing signs of age.
 

 
The world isn't just filled with youthful beauties; every age has its own charm. Duan Ge clearly lived a turbulent life, and her features, weathered by hardship, remained strikingly beautiful and aggressively alluring. The same high bridge of her nose and deep-set eyes that appeared on Concubine Chen's face had a seductive allure, while on Duan Ge, they resembled a brightly colored leopard—dazzling yet intimidating, making one awestruck but not daring to touch.
 

 
The original scene was softened by the dim yellow oil lamp, but Shi Qianqiu altered its tone, making it heavy and oppressive.
 

 
The oil lamp cast the silhouette of a slender figure against the wall as someone entered.
 

 
Who is this uninvited guest?
 

 
This was the hint and information provided by the visuals and background music.
 

 
Duan Ge looked up and smiled, "What a rare visitor."
 

 
"I came to find something."
 

 
Following Duan Ge's upward motion, the camera shifted too.
 

 
This camera movement allowed the viewers to share Duan Ge's perspective and clearly see the visitor—it was actually Tong Zhao! She was dressed in casual attire, looking most like her real-life self.
 

 
At this moment, the camera didn’t capture Duan Ge’s expression, even cutting out her voice, focusing instead on her tightly gripped Swiss Army knife, conveying the message that "Feng Yanqi is unhappy to see Tong Zhao" through body language alone.
 

 
Duan Ge: "At that time, I just wanted to hug Tong Zhao so badly that I tightened my grip on the Swiss Army knife."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "But you still hugged me, didn’t you?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "I couldn’t help it."
 

 
The next moment showed Duan Ge stepping forward to tightly embrace Tong Zhao.
 

 
— "Killing is a heavy crime," came the husky, mature tone of Duan Ge.
 

 
— "Isn’t it only natural to listen to me?" This was a cheeky, arrogant line from Concubine Chen.
 

 
Duan Ge held on tightly, burying her face in Tong Zhao's hair.
 

 
Removing their real dialogue and adding somber, tense background music made the conveyed message very clear, leaving behind huge questions... This mature version of Tong Zhao listened to her orders to kill while simultaneously searching for something, establishing a clear dominant-submissive relationship between them.
 

 
The question remained: What were they searching for? Why did they share such strikingly similar features?
 

 
Montage editing can manipulate time and space, playing with the narrative. The director would cut out scenes deemed unnecessary, sometimes inserting footage from different timelines, locations, or even entirely different films to construct a fabricated storyline.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "What does this Shi person mean? Am I ordering Duan Ge to kill?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "If you need it, I'm more than willing."
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled delightfully.
 

 
In the film, immediately after "Isn't it only natural to listen to me?" was a passionate kiss between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao in the pottery studio from "Sea King Kill"...
 

 
After a long kiss, they locked eyes, and Han Zhi whispered:
 

 
"Of course, I'll listen to you."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had somehow obtained a lossless audio version, and with headphones on, it felt as if Han Zhi was whispering directly into the viewers' ears, causing Sister Chu to blush, while she was left stunned by this cross-genre dialogue: "This works too?"
 

 
"Basic operation. It’s clear you don’t often watch romantic pairing edits.”
 

 
Hearing her artist say this, Sister Chu began to consider spending more time on Bilibili.
 

 
She followed the data feedback from major video platforms, but terms like "la lang" left her feeling completely confused.
 

 
Next, they cut to clips of Han Zhi flirting with Zhong Muxi and Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The two girls were infatuated with their idol, interspersed with Han Zhi's gaze towards them that hinted at pity, suggesting he was seducing them at Tong Zhao's command, something he didn't want to do. The final clip of Zhong Muxi self-harming placed the blame squarely on Han Zhi.
 

 
Han Zhi: "..."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Wow, my brother's reputation is suffering."
 

 
However, the next clip split the blame between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—
 

 
Leaning lazily against the doorframe, Tong Zhao asked, "She didn’t cry and run away?"
 

 
After speaking, a haughty smile appeared on her delicate, beautiful face, exuding a poisonous charm.
 

 
— "Nowhere to be found; I can’t find it."
 

 
Tong Zhao's voice in the monologue grew increasingly irritable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "This is what I said in 'Sea King Kill' when I couldn’t find Wei Zekai."
 

 
The ending of this segment transitioned to an empty mansion, suggesting abandonment.
 

 
— "Sometimes I feel like he needs a little stimulation."
 

 
— "Without some stimulation, how would he know the potential he could unleash?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is…"
 

 
Chen Guifei: "I saw He Shun's inner monologue.”
 

 
Sure.
 

 
What played next was a scene of Chen Zhuzhi portraying Shao Xuanzheng, pacing back and forth in front of the alchemy furnace on the night before he attacked his partner, murmuring, "If I really do this, there’s no turning back..."
 

 
The shadows on the alchemy furnace flickered, accompanied by Tong Zhao's light, arrogant mockery: "Always thinking about turning back; no wonder you achieve nothing."
 

 
This was from "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the concubine belittles the other consorts.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng's inner struggle was edited by Shi Qianqiu into a dialogue.
 

 
Next, it seemed that everything Mu Yingchen suffered was manipulated by Tong Zhao from behind.
 

 
Concubine Chen praised sweetly: "This segment is well edited; Director Shi is a genius!"
 

 
The edit focused on her bullying of Lu Xianzhang, and Shi Qianqiu immediately elevated from "that Shi" to "Director Shi," changing his tone faster than flipping a page.
 

 
The manager was speechless: "Is Director Shi playing with his own film?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "He seems to be having a lot of fun."
 

 
After the misleading editing of "Heartless Tribulation," the scene shifted to Tong Zhao visiting Lu Xianzhang in the consciousness palace. At that moment, Lu Xianzhang was meditating in a corner, giving Shi Qianqiu ample space to create something out of nothing, first cutting to Lu Xianzhang with his eyes closed—
 

 
Lu Xianzhang appeared as a twenty-eight-year-old version of Tong Zhao, about the same age as Duan Ge, but showing signs of a life of luxury, exuding a cool, ethereal presence like a fallen immortal.
 

 
Though it was the same face and age, viewers could clearly feel that this was not the same person.
 

 
Inserting Mu Yingchen's original voice: "Are you satisfied now?"
 

 
"I will never be satisfied." This was the concubine's line.
 

 
Under Shi Qianqiu's editing, "Tong Zhao" in the consciousness palace was searching for something while continuously issuing commands for these "selves" to do bad deeds, not hesitating to harm them to achieve her goals, clearly portraying a behind-the-scenes manipulator, a super big boss.
 

 
During the second viewing, Tong Zhao noticed a detail: "The order is reversed this time; in the original, I first saw the concubine, then went to the storage room."
 

 
Why edit it this way?
 

 
Is it just a matter of habit?
 

 
At this point, the scene switches to "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the first clip shows the concubine being pushed into a palace by her family, instructed to serve the emperor well and gain his favor. Her youthful face reveals a hint of fear and confusion. This segment was a hard-won edit by the director of "The Ming Emperor," as Tong Zhao usually appears very confident and ambitious.
 

 
What is weakness? It doesn't exist.
 

 
In the scene, the young Tong Zhao closes her eyes tightly, as if trying to blink away her tears.
 

 
When she opens her eyes again, she sees the luxurious concubine, who turns around with an air of unmatched nobility: "Are you here to accompany me?"
 

 
The playful words were cut out.
 

 
After seeing the younger face that resembled her own, Tong Zhao had a sudden realization about the arrangement of the scenes—
 

 
the age difference.
 

 
From maturity to innocence, the concubine is the younger one.
 

 
"Aren't you here specifically to find me?"
 

 
"Come here and hug me."
 

 
In the original version, Tong Zhao's words were completely muted, leaving only a silent, hopeless embrace.
 

 
In film and television, silence and blank spaces are also a form of expression.
 

 
This transitions into another embrace—between the Ming Emperor, played by Song Wanzhuo, and the concubine. She opens her arms to wrap around the emperor, tilting her face up to flirt with him for a moment before resting her head against his chest. From the emperor's unseen angle, her youthful and beautiful face breaks into a slight smile, and the ambitious spark in her eyes burns like two flames, making the concubine even more captivating.
 

 
Sister Chu commented, "This uses a contrast of strength and weakness. She wants to use the Ming Emperor, but when you embrace her, she is fully reliant on you."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Wanzhuo has become a reliable tool."
 

 
Fast forward to the concubine's grand ceremony.
 

 
The concubine said, "With the queen gone, I am now the most esteemed woman in the world."
 

 
She asked, "Are you satisfied?"
 

 
Under the clear sky, countless noblewomen bowed to her. The splendidly beautiful concubine, adorned with heavy makeup, appeared even more stunning, yet her true emotions remained inscrutable.
 

 
—“Not enough, still not enough.”
 

 
This line is also spoken by the concubine in "Ming Emperor."
 

 
Each word captures her insatiable ambition and darkness.
 

 
Outside of the scene, the concubine remarked, "So, I even torment myself when I go crazy?"
 

 
The camera ended with a shot of a noblewoman who once troubled the concubine, bowing her head in resentment. As she lowered her head, the view went dark, and when it brightened again, it revealed a door opening in the consciousness palace.
 

 
This time, it was a door leading out from a room into a vast white hall…
 

 
“Tong Zhao.”
 

 
It was Han Zhi's voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to meet his deep, melancholic eyes.
 

 
Here, apart from the call, all other lines were cut, and unnecessary contact was removed, leaving only Tong Zhao walking toward one of the rooms.
 

 
The door was opened just a crack, but was caught by a security chain.
 

 
A small, soft white hand reached out from within.
 

 
At this moment, Shi Qianqiu pulled a side mirror for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Cold white light shone from the side, casting deeper contrasts on her expressionless face. Her pale eyes churned with nameless emotions, resembling an unfathomable abyss. Objectively speaking, Tong Zhao's expression was serious and heavy, with a hint of struggle that made her appear somewhat fierce.
 

 
—“You’re next.”
 

 
This was the thought of the concubine when she saw Wei Zekai in "Sea King Kill."
 

 
As soon as the words fell, that obviously childlike hand was firmly grasped by Tong Zhao.
 

 
The screen abruptly plunged into darkness.
 

 
---
 

 
Starring: Tong Zhao
 

 
Post-production: Shi Qianqiu
 

 
Acknowledgments: Copyright holders of "The Legend of Ming Emperor," "Sea King Kill," "Countdown 72 Hours," and "Heartless Tribulation.”
 

 
---
 

 
The manager, Sister Chu, was a bit suspicious of her eyes. She opened the original film on her phone and scrolled to the last part.
 

 
When the last door was stuck by the security chain, a childish voice from behind it apologized, "Zhao Zhao, I'm sorry. I can’t reach the chain even if I jump."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded patiently, "It's okay, I'll find a way."
 

 
Then she comfortingly held the child's small hand.
 

 
The two clearly had a very close relationship, trusting each other.
 

 
However, under the editing of Shi Qianqiu, Tong Zhao was portrayed as a cruel and cold mysterious figure, behind whose manipulation lay the misfortunes of many worlds, ultimately even resorting to harming innocent children. After watching this footage, Dr. Gu from the Instinct Film Association would likely suspect her of having antisocial and inhumane tendencies.
 

 
In plain terms, she was edited into a villainous character.
 

 
Although there are too many flaws to know where to start, objectively speaking, Tong Zhao admits that Shi Qianqiu made the character of "Tong Zhao" quite charming. Whether it’s the color grading, camera angles, or the accompanying BGM, she appears as a dark and beautiful mysterious villain.
 

 
She sent a message to Shi Qianqiu: "So what is the protagonist actually looking for?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: "I don’t know!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "It was just an idea from the evaluator for you to explore the consciousness palace more, to gather more information—there's no deeper reason."
 

 
Good point, “I don’t know.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Then didn’t you just turn it into a story? Digging a pit and not filling it?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Digging pits and not filling them is indeed one of my specialties.”
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered and opened Shi Qianqiu's Bilibili account, checking the section labeled "His Videos." It featured his representative work, "[Harry X Qingwen] So Sexual," along with a bunch of "series" like "When Qingwen Travels to the HP World (Part 1)," "Wang Xifeng Teaches Iron Man Business (Part 1)," "Jia Mu Visits Stark Tower (Part 1)," and "[Lu Zhishen X Loki] Mu Shaoai (Part 1)..."
 

 
The reason for the quotation marks around "series" is that once he finishes one, there’s no follow-up.
 

 
No matter how well-received or how many collections and likes he gets, he remains unfazed—no sequels, digging pits without filling them!
 

 
That's right.
 

 
As mentioned earlier, Shi Qianqiu is not a perfect person; he has bold ideas and creative editing but lacks strong logic. He often has short-lived enthusiasm, digs a pit, and then doesn’t want to fill it, with grand plans that he can't follow through. It's common for authors to finish works out of necessity, but he isn’t short on money and digs pits for fun, which is even more infuriating.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu kindly let her use the materials freely; he had already negotiated with the copyright holders.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Okay.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had inadvertently fallen into the pit, no longer wanted to talk to the "Pit King."
 

 
She explained the situation and posted both versions edited by Shiqianqiu on Weibo.
 

 
@TongZhaov:
 

 
"Did a check at the association.
 

 
@ShiQianqiu helped edit the film, adding a bit of material for a micro-movie version. Watch whichever you prefer."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted the micro-movie version on Weibo.
 

 
So, while her agent was marketing behind the scenes, they mainly pushed that post... In reality, the marketing money was just icing on the cake. Who is Shi Qianqiu? Tong Zhao is currently the hottest actress, with countless eyes focused on her. There had been speculation about their collaboration, and some imaginative netizens even claimed that their next joint announcement would definitely be about a wedding.
 

 
This scared many of Tong Zhao's career fans.
 

 
When her family matters were brought to light, her mother—who had once won a Best Actress award—was also dug up. Fans feared that Tong Zhao might end up like her mother, marrying and retiring from acting with no more works. They really didn’t want her to date—after all, they hadn’t seen enough of her films!
 

 
Instead of wedding news, fans received a micro-movie.
 

 
While they felt relieved, they were also a bit pleased.
 

 
In the past, some actors had shared their examination videos from the Association, creating an intimate feeling similar to reading a diary from their idol's private account.
 

 
Non-fans were also curious about Tong Zhao's examination results.
 

 
After all, she was known for her strong and unique subconscious.
 

 
How special could she be without the halo of her character templates?
 

 
Fans and onlookers clicked on the original link to the micro-movie.
 

 
It started with clips from "Countdown 72 Hours," and early fans were quite happy, but soon they sensed something was off.
 

 
First, a flood of question marks filled the screen.
 

 
[？？？？]
 

 
[Wow, where's this footage from? So much information!]
 

 
[Strangers asking for the source—this scene of a handsome guy being told to raise fish is so engaging, which idol drama is it from?]
 

 
[Hey, don't go, that’s not an idol drama; it’s from the variety show "Sea King Kill," and the truth isn’t like that…]
 

 
[Fans who have watched all of Tong Zhao's works assure you that the original story isn't set up this way!]
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans found themselves in a bizarre loop of accepting the problematic setting, thinking, “Once you accept it, it really feels amazing.” Meanwhile, confused onlookers became curious about the "original work," and after some explanation, they regretfully questioned:
 

 
[Alright then, where are these different age versions of Tong Zhao from?]
 

 
This…
 

 
The fans didn't know either.
 

 
Fortunately, the micro-movie was quite short. After watching it, the puzzled fans immediately went to see the examination result video edited by Shi Qianqiu, which was generally more authentic. This video's comments were sparse, and its view count was less than half that of the micro-movie.
 

 
[How many people are hidden in Sister Zhao’s mind???]
 

 
[Wow, don't worry about the number; just think about how much space is in a room—her subconscious intensity must be terrifying.]
 

 
[Incredible, Sister Zhao doesn't need character settings; she’s special enough on her own.]
 

 
[Is this really okay? The Association determined Zhao Zhao is healthy?] This came from fans who cared about Tong Zhao's well-being.
 

 
Discussion about Tong Zhao herself was mostly from those concerned about the entertainment industry.
 

 
Outsiders who only watched the micro-movie edited by Shi Qianqiu were captivated by the fabricated plot, thinking it was a trailer for some lengthy TV drama.
 

 
This clearly has a complete worldview and suspense that can be deeply explored!
 

 
So, some insiders, eager for drama, started spreading the news: “Shi Qianqiu is venturing into TV dramas! Once again collaborating with Tong Zhao for an ultra-long exquisite trailer
 

 
[video link]
 

 

 
.”
 

 
There’s even a plot summary, making it sound like a classic quick-transmigration story.
 

 
The production quality of this micro-movie is indeed excellent—its pacing is quick, easy to understand, and engaging. The suspense of the main character, who is also the behind-the-scenes antagonist, searching for something runs throughout the trailer, leading to unexpected buzz. It topped the daily charts of major video platforms, and even with fans frequently clarifying that this is not a TV drama, many netizens kept asking in confusion:
 

 
[When is Tong Zhao’s new drama airing?]
 

 
[Is Song Wanzhuo playing a supporting role? Zhao Jie is amazing!]
 

 
[Have I seen this Han Zhi before?]
 

 
With such a high-quality production, how could it just be a fan vlog?
 

 
It must be fans playing a joke!
 

 
…
 

 
Daily monitoring market feedback, agent Sister Chu remarked, “Tong Zhao, if you don’t turn this into a TV drama, it’ll be hard to wrap things up.”
 

 
“...Who cares? I’m off to survive on a deserted island.”
# Chapter64
It was originally possible to love whoever.
 

 
Imagination can be very aloof, but reality is full of complexities.
 

 
While the edited version went viral, surprisingly, the original version saw a drop in shares the next day in an unexpected manner—
 

 
Generally speaking, a Weibo post that gets thousands of shares goes through a fermentation process. It rises to a peak, then those interested share it early, followed by a stagnation and gradual decline until it fades into obscurity—this is the norm on Weibo.
 

 
Unless someone stirs the pot.
 

 
And someone did.
 

 
"Zhang Wenshi's Sharp Commentary: Tong Zhao is a Distorted Product of the Era's Excessive Reverence for Unique Subconsciousness"
 

 
[On October 22, 20xx, a sensational xianxia film officially premiered in all of Huaxia. This film faced countless doubts from preparation to release, with criticisms that no one could fulfill the role of the female lead. Then, Tong Zhao, symbolizing the "correct answer," fit in like the final puzzle piece of the film.]
 

 
Subsequently, the two biggest attention-seekers in all of Huaxia "collaborated" again, releasing a microfilm and a meticulously edited inspection video.
 

 
[In the era of instinctive cinema, unique subconsciousness is revered.]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is the most devoted follower of this genre. As a screenwriter, his actions are shameful; he indulges actors in straying from the path in the film and then calls it a masterpiece when they accidentally get it right? I cannot agree with that.]
 

 
[From Tong Zhao's original inspection footage, it’s clear that her most unique subconscious trait is possessing numerous distinct "personalities," rich enough for a holographic scanning system to model them in the palace of consciousness... I admit this is indeed special, but is it really worthy of praise?]
 

 
[Amidst all the admiration and accolades, I still have to say no.]
 

 
[Looking back, did Tong Zhao present different performances in "The Legend of Ming Emperor," "Countdown 72 Hours," and "Heartless Tribulation"? Is that truly excellent for instinctive cinema? Or is it an unstable hidden bomb? In the first three instances, she lucked out by showcasing the right side... Just think, if Tong Zhao from her concubine period were to star in a post-apocalyptic survival film, it would be a disaster!]
 

 
[The subconscious stability of seasoned instinctive actors only experiences a few fluctuations throughout their long careers due to real-life experiences, which is an understandable norm. From Tong Zhao's films, it's evident that she possesses far too much uncertainty; every performance is like rolling dice!]
 

 
[The vast majority of instinctive actors are quite stable, consistently playing similar roles and delivering outstanding performances. Tong Zhao relies on this characteristic to take chances in her films... I must admit, her luck is quite good; she always manages to roll the side she wants.]
 

 
[The emergence of this distorted unstable subconscious may be a responsibility we all share.]
 

 
[It is a tragedy of this era, and also a tragedy for the new generation of instinctive actors—]
 

 
[Just a friendly reminder, aside from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao has never used the same "personality" twice.]
 

 
……
 

 
This pointedly controversial post was shared by several entertainment accounts with millions of followers.
 

 
Fans and bystanders were a bit confused in the replies.
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has never done anything extreme or stirred up negative news; her public image is that of someone who works diligently.
 

 
However, after glancing a few times, bystanders found some validity in what this Zhang said.
 

 
Tong Zhao's subconscious is indeed quite unique!
 

 
Mainstream voices pursuing distinct subconsciousness might be overhyping it, potentially giving rise to a new generation of "Tong Zhaos." Clicking into the original post's comments revealed a flood of similar sentiments, expressing concern that Tong Zhao's unconventional acting style would ultimately lead to her downfall.
 

 
The retweets displayed a variety of opinions.
 

 
Some argued that he shouldn’t have criticized her by name, claiming it was overly provocative.
 

 
Others said he was just stirring the pot for attention, pointing out that Tong Zhao had never actually faltered in her performances.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi separately retweeted with: [I’m not targeting her; I’m targeting this kind of atmosphere.]
 

 
Some retweets wondered why the original post's comments were so one-sided.
 

 
It turned out the blogger had enabled a feature that highlights selected comments, which is why all the visible responses agreed with her. Uninformed netizens saw the comments and developed a herd mentality.
 

 
[Tong Zhao, whose heart did you stab? Look how sour the original poster is.]
 

 
[Check the box office of "Heartless Tribulation," then take a look at the industry... Turns out they aren't jealous of Tong Zhao; they're envious of Shi Qianqiu but don’t want to be too obvious, so they target Tong Zhao instead. After all, she is Shi Qianqiu’s most admired subconscious!]
 

 
[Witnessing the meltdown of a loser screenwriter.]
 

 
[Not every screenwriter gets to work with a subconscious as exceptional as Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
[Am I the only one who thinks the original poster's concerns are quite reasonable?]

Zhang Wenshi mentioning both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu essentially included "Heartless Tribulation" in the conversation.
 

 
The number of retweets surprised even him.
 

 
After all, the film's buzz had been extremely high lately—
 

 
How high?
 

 
Within three days of its release, the top trending topic on Zhihu was "How to evaluate the movie 'Heartless Tribulation'?"
 

 
Following that were various related questions and articles. Not only serious titles like "In-Depth Analysis of 'Heartless Tribulation'! The True Meaning Behind Mu Yingchen's Quest for the Sword," and "Who dares to say they understand Tong Zhao?" but also open-ended storytelling questions like "If you were Mu Yingchen, how would you break the deadlock?" had numerous responses.
 

 
The enthusiasm for the movie among netizens is clearly still high.
 

 
When you're on the cutting edge, even pigs can fly.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is a hot topic right now, and Zhang Wenshi has opened this conversation from an alternative angle.
 

 
Previous discussions mainly focused on the film itself.
 

 
His critical review shifted the audience's attention from the movie to Tong Zhao's subconscious traits.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Who is this Zhang Wenshi?"
 

 
The article was sent to her by an outraged assistant, and discussions were also happening in the crew's WeChat group. Tong Zhao couldn't recall offending him and felt a bit confused.
 

 
But after a moment of bewilderment, she regained her composure.
 

 
Even a scathing piece like this could gain traction, indicating she's riding the wave of popularity—something to be happy about.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Yeah, who is it?"
 

 
As soon as he popped up, a prop master chimed in: "It's your rival, Director Shi! He's your counterpart!"
 

 
Director Shi was shocked: "I have a rival?"
 

 
Immediately, a more informed crew member jumped in to enlighten them about the situation.
 

 
He indeed has a rival.
 

 
In fact, the number of rivals he has might even exceed some popular figures in the industry.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu is straightforward and often acts arrogantly, which has drawn criticism from many within the industry.
 

 
He was very easygoing with his subordinates and staff. Teased as the last eunuch in China for his habit of digging holes and not filling them, he didn’t take offense when called “Old Thief Shi” or “Eunuch Shi.” Sometimes, if the jokes went on too long, he would cryptically remark, “Impotence is actually the key to unlocking the second gate of wisdom for men; it's a blessing,” leaving people too stunned to continue murmuring about him.
 

 
With his peers, if someone wanted to discuss professional topics, he wouldn’t beat around the bush. He said exactly what he thought, often putting others in awkward positions. Yet, he had a divine talent for editing and directing, as if fate itself was feeding him.
 

 
At one dinner, the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi of "Non-Official Lover" learned that Shi Qianqiu had seen the preview of his film and insisted on getting his feedback. After being turned down twice, Zhang insisted on downing three drinks as a form of self-punishment, claiming that if Shi didn’t provide feedback, he should at least drink with him.
 

 
Shi wasn’t angry. Instead, he looked at Zhang with pity, thinking how poorly written it was, yet the writer was so eager to improve that he openly sought advice. It was truly a spirit of literary sacrifice.
 

 
"Alright, let’s help him out."
 

 
"I did watch 'Non-Official Lover.' I was quite surprised to see someone deliberately avoiding all the popular answers for innovation. It’s easy to imagine the writer trying to break the mold and ending up with a hodgepodge of disconnected sketches. Since the story wasn’t told well and didn’t please the audience... My suggestion? The best advice is to stop treating the audience and mainstream as fools. If you don’t understand why certain tropes are popular, don’t try to break them. Show some respect for your audience."
 

 
After encouraging drinking all evening, the previously tipsy screenwriter Zhang Wenshi instantly sobered up.
 

 
He couldn’t have been more awake.
 

 
The room fell silent, with the women he had forced to drink stifling laughter to the point of oxygen deprivation.
 

 
When "Non-Official Lover" was released, the box office indeed crashed, just as Shi Qianqiu predicted. A well-known critic, unaware of their feud, gave a similar review: "The screenwriter seems to misunderstand tropes. In the process of exploring innovation, constant attempts can overwhelm a film. If the skill isn’t sufficient, there shouldn’t be more than one or one-and-a-half innovative attempts in a single movie—films require guiding the audience. If the director is also uncertain, how can they lead?" He ended with recognition of the writer’s innovative spirit, giving him face.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was right about everything.
 

 
But he was too harsh.
 

 
The consequence of being harsh is having no friends, spending every day digging holes at home. Shi willingly accepted this outcome, conveniently avoiding unnecessary social interactions. Some colleagues, struck by his critiques but unwilling to admit it, harbored grudges against him while trying to console themselves that he simply couldn’t give compliments.
 

 
Humans are strange creatures; when one discovers that someone is consistently critical, it softens the sting of their own criticisms.
 

 
This balance worked well—until the anomaly, Tong Zhao, appeared.
 

 
Shi praised her highly, proving that he could indeed speak kindly. His compliments and criticisms were genuine, which only made those he had criticized feel even worse about themselves.
 

 
Take the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, for instance.
 

 
He was quite pleased when "Heartless Tribulation" was indefinitely shelved due to the inability to find a lead actress, secretly celebrating with champagne at home—how could Shi Qianqiu criticize him for having high expectations? At Shi's standards for female leads, it could take ten more years to make this film!
 

 
However, before he could finish the discounted champagne, "Heartless Tribulation" officially announced its lead actress.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi: …damn it.
 

 
As he watched the film rise to great heights, breaking box office records, he…
 

 
Had nothing better to do than write little essays and shower praise on Tong Zhao, damn!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi's mindset could have been balanced; it was Tong Zhao who ruined it for him.
 

 
He bought the viewing rights for "Heartless Tribulation" and watched it in a holographic cinema no less than three times. Given Shi Qianqiu's negative reputation with him, along with the bias of his colleagues, he couldn’t understand why this film was so successful.
 

 
It was too cliché!
 

 
Wasn’t it just a typical female empowerment story?
 

 
Although Zhang Wenshi didn’t predict that Mu Yingchen would experience a rebirth through adversity, he did foresee the reversal. The later Goldfinger moments given to the female lead by Shi were plentiful—Tong Zhao delivered a performance worthy of the extravagant budget, delighting the audience and reflecting positively at the box office, leading to a significant profit.
 

 
Box office figures are straightforward data that can be checked online at any time.
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming praise for the two of them in the news, Zhang Wenshi felt a slight crack in his composure.
 

 
Initially, he simply disliked Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He believed that "Heartless Tribulation" became successful due to the lead actress's influence. If he could get Tong Zhao for his own project, he could also create a blockbuster!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi happened to be working on a film that still needed a lead actress. The director and producers agreed with his suggestion that Tong Zhao would be an excellent choice, so they sent the script to her agent, expressing their interest in inviting her.
 

 
Tong Zhao declined.
 

 
The film was titled "Chasing Immortals."
 

 
Just hearing the title felt like a trend-chaser, and Tong Zhao didn't want to repeat herself or slow her momentum; she needed to rest—so she turned it down casually, having rejected countless offers lately, and didn’t take this small matter to heart.
 

 
The director and producers of "Chasing Immortals" didn't mind much either.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao's market value was soaring, with billions in box office earnings. If she agreed to star in another fantasy film, that would truly shock them!
 

 
Only Zhang Wenshi cared deeply.
 

 
Without Tong Zhao, it seemed he could never compete on the same stage as Shi Qianqiu…
 

 
This "harsh critique" was a product of his imbalanced mindset.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi originally just wanted to vent, but he didn't expect many who envied "Heartless Tribulation" box office and resented Tong Zhao's recent success to rally behind him, firing the first shot against her—
 

 
Calling it an attack felt more like a way to vent their frustrations.
 

 
Tong Zhao had only just debuted a little over a year ago, and at such a young age, what if it affected her mindset? In the era of instinctual filmmaking, mindset has a significant impact on the subconscious. Some young actors, in order to adjust their mentality, choose to take breaks during their peak times.
 

 
"This is a psychological tactic; Zhang Wenshi seems like a fool being used in the moment… Just look at his previous conflicts with Shi Qianqiu to see he isn’t very smart."
 

 
Agent Chu analyzed this for Tong Zhao, hoping she wouldn’t be affected.
 

 
This is also a product of the instinctual filmmaking era, which focuses on actors' mindsets, akin to how they used to sabotage singers' voices.
 

 
"Don't worry, my mindset is solid; I’m very stable," Tong Zhao reassured her. "Think positively—I’m about to get popular again!"
 

 
Being comforted by an artist who could be her niece, Chu was a bit amused. She said, "You still have the energy to cheer me up! I'm fine; can there really be a problem? My biggest issue is that my throat hurts from all the calls I’ve been getting, all wanting to invite you to be the lead!"
 

 
"Isn't that the case with every project?"
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t react much.
 

 
"In the past, only similar types of projects would invite you. Now, well… I can’t say all, but among the scripts being produced daily in Huaxia, removing those who know they can’t afford you or those already designated with better options, most roles will first come to you. You’ll pick from what’s left, and only then will others get a chance to compete. Sigh, anyone who can call me has some skills; the rest just email me, which is making my eyesight worse.”
 

 
Sister Chu spoke with a tone that suggested regret yet was filled with genuine delight as she boasted.
 

 
After she finished, she glanced at Tong Zhao, waiting for her reaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “If your throat hurts, drink more warm water and make sure there’s plenty of light in the room.”
 

 
…Okay, her artist's mindset should be fine now.
 

 
The discussion in the WeChat group was lively; after all, this was clearly aimed at undermining ‘Heartless Tribulation’ and its golden crown.
 

 
Modeling artist: “Will it affect the box office? It hasn’t even peaked yet.”
 

 
Supporting actor: “Come on, Shi, do something. Isn’t it time to buy him some help?”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “Should I speak up to support Zhao Zhao? That guy is turning Tong Zhao into someone who seems ready to collapse at any moment!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Support Sister Zhao!”
 

 
The actress playing Qing Niang, Fu Xiaoheng, was eager to call him Master. She felt a strong connection and was even more outraged than Tong Zhao, who was being slandered; she had already retweeted and blasted Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Should I respond?”
 

 
The director wanted to set a good example for everyone.
 

 
However, the crowd immediately restrained him.
 

 
He was a public relations disaster who spoke too loudly.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng understood and took on the responsibility, representing ‘Heartless Tribulation’ with a brief statement. He assured that the entire film's production was legal and compliant, with no crew members experiencing psychological issues during filming. He emphasized that the team didn’t glorify anyone but simply aimed to make a good movie while trying some new approaches to entertain the audience.
 

 
He shared this statement with the group for review before posting, receiving unanimous praise like “Top-notch bureaucratic tone,” “That basically means nothing!” and “This definitely won’t be a problem now!” among other affirmations.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng was relatively unknown, a non-entity in the film industry, with only a few thousand fans on Weibo—one-third bought, one-third given away.
 

 
His voice was reliable, but no one paid him any attention.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: "Hey, Shi, you should retweet and support this!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted.
 

 
So he wanted him to back him up?
 

 
He was sincere, not cutting corners with fast-forward, and added, “Well said!” to show his support.
 

 
However, the comments and retweets below didn’t match Shi Qianqiu’s expectations—
 

 
[Deputy Director’s words seemed normal, but once Shi Old Thief retweeted, it took on a strange vibe.]
 

 
[Now it feels off.]
 

 
[Aren’t you going to say something else? We’re waiting for you to confront someone!]
 

 
Many were eager to see him clash with Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Netizens were excitedly following the situation. Since Shi Qianqiu retweeted the crew’s stance, Tong Zhao should come out and say something too! They kept refreshing Tong Zhao’s Weibo page until finally, her response appeared—
 

 
@Tong Zhao V:
 

 
“Well said! //@Shi Qianqiu: Well said!”
 

 
[Deputy Director Zeng’s Weibo]
 

 
…
 

 
Originally, Deputy Director Zeng’s serious comments became amusing after being mixed up with the two big names.
 

 
Fans, who were initially angry, were amused by their sister’s tweet.
 

 
[Sister, don’t get led astray! /laughing and crying/ laughing and crying.]
 

 
[If it goes astray, so be it. Isn’t optimism better? Just don’t let it affect your mindset. What’s so special about subconsciousness? I love every version of Tong Zhao (especially Han Zhi).]
 

 
[Same here! It’s all Tong Zhao herself (especially love for Han Zhi).]
 

 
Some of the popular comments got sidetracked, while the rest understood the main points the subject wanted to express, organizing their agreement—returning to the film itself, Tong Zhao is healthy, gets along well with the crew, and doesn’t give off any sour vibes.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans understood the message.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng opened with a solid start, but he never expected the two to take a sharp turn, leaving the supporting cast to go along with the humor, using the format “Well said!” to uniformly express their stance.
 

 
These catchy four words washed over the audience’s minds.
 

 
# "The Heartless Tribulation" Crew: Well said! #
 

 
The tension was diffused by humor. It was the weekend, and many workers connected to the holographic network, interested in the topic on Weibo, bought viewing rights.
 

 
“Heartless Tribulation" not only exploded in popularity but also had lasting momentum.
 

 
Previously, there was a chorus of praise, and many were curious enough to watch, with some managing to hold back. Now that there were questioning voices, those who had hesitated were even more curious—
 

 
Is it really that good?
 

 
Good enough to make peers jump in frustration?
 

 
When Zhang Wenshi saw this question, he nearly had a heart attack from anger.
 

 
[It really is that good! Mu Yingchen's sword skills are exceptional.]
 

 
[I don’t like that Tong Zhao has so many facets... if only she were like Mu Yingchen in real life...]
 

 
Fans who got to know Tong Zhao through "Heartless Tribulation" felt unsettled.
 

 
In the age of instinctive cinema, characters and actors are inseparable. Fans who got hooked after watching the show wouldn’t unfollow due to a significant gap with the actors; instead, they’d feel reassured by the consistency between on-screen and off-screen personas! But Tong Zhao was an exception—liking her felt like traditional fandom, with a clear separation between the character and the actress.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans quickly jumped in to say they were used to it.
 

 
[Oh, what's the big deal? Fans of Han Zhi's girlfriend are the real zen ones.]
 

 
[I suggest you check out Tong Zhao’s other works; every version of her is quite charming!]
 

 
Fans who loved Tong Zhao’s ethereal, cold demeanor were still quite conflicted.
 

 
This group cared a lot about Zhang Wenshi’s article, where he pointed out that Tong Zhao's performances would be fleeting, never to be seen again...
 

 
Never to be seen again? What should they do?
 

 
Just pay to watch it again!
 

 
Rewatching is basic; some even watched it three or four times.
 

 
However, besides core fans, most were drawn in by the big scenes.
 

 
A film good enough to warrant a rewatch certainly has lasting appeal.
 

 
No matter how jealous peers were, no matter how hard it was to accept, "Heartless Tribulation" still dominated the box office, creating a significant gap with the second and third-place films. Song Wanzhuo's manager stopped mentioning Tong Zhao, instead praising his insight in booking a duet with the box office goddess.
 

 
Wanzhuo felt a bit discontent.
 

 
He understood "Heartless Tribulation" fans all too well.
 

 
Why couldn't Tong Zhao be as enchanting as in "Emperor Ming"?
 

 
He felt the same way.
 

 
Perhaps it was the editing by Shi Qianqiu that triggered this reaction. Bilibili's talented UP creators, unwilling to fall behind Shi, began to take action.
 

 
Other UP creators had to admire Shi Qianqiu; his angle of “Tong Zhao in different works—self-reliant yet vulnerable” generated the highest buzz. Collaborating with other male leads didn’t compare to this theme, and there were plenty of editing opportunities.
 

 
And since it has an ancient backdrop, the hottest pairing is...
 

 
Immortal Master X Imperial Concubine.
# Chapter65
How did these two end up together?
 

 
Viewers who have watched this TV series and the movie may feel puzzled. In "The Legend of Emperor Ming," the favored consort has always ignored same-sex affections. Although part of this is due to the assumption that same-sex individuals in the harem are competitors, it is true that the consort has never shown tenderness towards women.
 

 
Mu Yingchen is a character who is completely the opposite.
 

 
She is exceptionally gentle with girls and shows no interest in men.
 

 
Even when treating her male disciples, her kindness is limited to not drawing her sword...
 

 
In "The Heartless Tribulation," there is a segment questioning Yingchen Fairy about only accepting female disciples, highlighting her obvious favoritism towards them.
 

 
Mu Yingchen coldly replied:
 

 
"Isn't the favoritism that men receive in this world enough? Family businesses, ancestral lines, and achievements are all inherited by men. In the mortal realm, respect is given to the ruler, the father, and the husband. Given that they enjoy so many benefits yet still feel insufficient, they cannot tolerate my favoritism towards women and come to dispute it with the term 'fairness'? My actions do not require outside opinions. If you have anything to say, take it up with my sword."
 

 
The hall fell silent immediately.
 

 
Who would dare take on her sword and then talk about fairness?
 

 
So no one dared to speak.
 

 
If we must talk about the commonalities between the two, it’s that they are both domineering, portrayed by the same actress, and are both female.
 

 
No matter how hard you think about it, you just can’t understand how they got paired together.
 

 
It’s okay not to understand.
 

 
Perhaps those in the know might not get it, but many fans take pride in creating a shipping vibe between two people who had no connection, watching the audience evolve from “Wait, how is this possible?” to “Once I accepted this pairing, it’s actually kind of cute,” and finally to “What is this random pairing? This AE is real!”...
 

 
Among them, the thrill of distorting facts and manipulating hearts is like a god holding great power.
 

 
Once the first shipper video hit the charts, other shippers eagerly followed suit—
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Correct Way to Open the Palace and Immortal Realm”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Girls She Loved Were Fake”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Wind Rises”
 

 
It’s like the classic scene of Bucky falling from a train off a cliff, frequently used in Marvel edits; this couple also has a scene that gets recycled over and over—
 

 
Coincidentally, the luxurious palanquin that the female supporting character Li Qiaoqiao rides in "The Heartless Tribulation" shares the same modeling code as the one used for the favored consort in "The Legend of Emperor Ming" when she is brought into the palace. The production team didn’t think much of it; they simply bought a set for the popular data and that was it, which resulted in solid evidence that “this cross-drama couple is real.”
 

 
Thus, with injuries all over and looking utterly disheveled, Mu Yingchen leans against the tree once again, only daring to silently gaze at the magnificent palanquin on the main path, inside of which sits the girl she loves, about to be taken into the imperial palace...
 

 
Meanwhile, the actress playing Li Qiaoqiao, Ding Jiao, tweeted a complaint.
 

 
@DingJiaoV:
 

 
I shouldn’t be inside the palanquin; I should be underneath it.
 

 
[Mu Fei CP Screenshot]
 

 
The comments below are hilarious.
 

 
[Poor sister became a tool/dog head emoji]
 

 
[I’ve really been brainwashed by these edits and have rewatched “The Heartless Tribulation” three times, always wanting to see where the favored consort is...]
 

 
[Mu Fei Szd!!! I recommend everyone to watch “[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears,” the lyrics fit perfectly; it’s so heartbreaking!]
 

 
“[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears”
 

 
This video topped the Bilibili film and television editing hot list, ranking fourth overall, showing just how many netizens it touched.
 

 
Due to the numerous close-ups of their one-sided conversations, they edited it into a shippy dialogue.
 

 
—You gaze at the horizon, I gaze at your face [Note 1]
 

 
In the masterful editing of the canola flower creator, the favored consort says, “This dance, the person I wanted to perform it for is no longer here.” It’s actually about her regretful sister, the queen, but it was interpreted as referring to Mu Yingchen.
 

 
Mu Yingchen once danced with a sword on the Sword Peak, accompanied by the favored consort playing the guzheng for the emperor.
 

 
When the background music changes, it feels like one person plays the zither while the other dances.
 

 
Favored Consort: “I want the riches of this world.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen: “Wealth and power are nothing but dust.”
 

 
There’s a close-up of Mu Yingchen holding her sword, her cold voice stating, “My golden core has been shattered, and my spiritual power is nearly depleted; today is my day to die.”
 

 
“I’ve come to seek justice for myself, to settle the past grievances.”
 

 
After saying this, she strikes down with her sword.
 

 
This section cuts from some unfortunate period drama where the palace gets destroyed.
 

 
Next is the scene where the favored consort coughs up blood and dies in the emperor's embrace.
 

 
A close-up of Mu Yingchen's astonished expression follows.
 

 
A tear falls from the favored consort’s eye, sliding down her delicate cheek.
 

 
—Your tears are not the only thing teetering on the edge.
 

 
—The mocking wind sings a farewell. [Note 2]
 

 
Here begins a series of hard cuts showcasing memories, accompanied by suggestive lines that could easily confuse viewers who haven't seen the original version:
 

 
Favored Consort: “The first time I saw her, I thought to myself, how could there be such a woman in the world? She is beautiful and noble, has a good background, and the man she marries is…” Her voice trails off, a hint of mockery evident in her tone.
 

 
It transitions to Mu Yingchen’s debut at the Dao Companion Ceremony, dressed in white, untainted by dust.
 

 
The creator who used “A Thousand Years of Tears” as background music has a dirty mind. At the end, they splice in the “Sea King Kill” along with the real-life “Tong Zhao,” crafting a yuri version of their reunion a thousand years later. This edit is much easier since Tong Zhao has recently become popular due to Mu Yingchen’s role, and during promotional events, she would pose with a cold expression that matched everyone’s imagination, thus…
 

 
Cold and aloof actress X manipulative green tea, modern CP is now a thing.
 

 
“The rise of the Mu Fei CP, and the biggest victim should be my brother, Wan Zhuo.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really has it hard.
 

 
He was dragged out to be beaten down again.
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a duet for the New Year’s Eve party? Considering the timing, it was about right, so he posted on Weibo again, cueing Tong Zhao. The tone was very businesslike, almost bureaucratic, clearly written by his agent. However, the comments section completely backfired.
 

 
[Break up my Mu Fei CP, the dog emperor, come out and face death!]
 

 
[But I want to see the consort and Mu Yingchen sing love songs together. How about you take responsibility for playing the guzheng, Your Majesty?]
 

 
This comment immediately sparked a rebuttal from Wanzhuo's fans: [No way, our brother can only play the electric guitar. Can Yingchen rock out?]
 

 
Although Tong Zhao and Song Wanzhuo had a very casual friendship, they maintained ongoing collaborations in public.
 

 
Their relationship was known to be pretty good, and when others commented on it like this, fans would inevitably start arguing.
 

 
The new generation of young stars were all avid surfers on the internet, and Song Wanzhuo was no exception. He loved browsing Bilibili to watch video edits. During the middle of “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” the romantic plot between the dog emperor and the favored consort sparked a wave of videos, and he had saved a special compilation of moments with his goddess in his favorites.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo complained to Tong Zhao on WeChat: [Why am I the dog emperor again? I clearly pamper you!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Because in the fan edits, you killed the favored consort.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was taken aback: [Why would I kill my beloved consort?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The plot needs a villain; just accept your fate.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [I must be the most resentful person regarding this CP in the world.]
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and wanted to say, “No, you’re not.”
 

 
The most resentful person in her mind was—
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Help! Spare me, even if all the men in the world die, I will never have the thought of being with her!]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [If I have committed any offenses, the palace rules would punish me, not let me see this kind of thing.]
 

 
Concubine Chen’s intense output: [Even if I were paired with He Shun, at least that would make sense. Have we ever appeared together? It’s impossible. Let go of that thought; the person edited in is not me at all.]
 

 
Duan Ge (brother) accurately strikes: [You guys are serious.]
 

 
[Back in the palace, could the palace rules do anything to you?] Lu Yingchen said coolly, with a tone full of exhaustion from seeing the fickleness of the world: [It’s quite nice; finally, there’s something that can sanction you, the calamity-bringing concubine.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I really enjoy watching these videos. I didn’t expect that we could have this side in the eyes of the audience. They all praise your portrayal of Mu Yingchen as the most ethereal cultivator! In “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” you were a flower of wealth and nobility, but in “The Heartless Tribulation,” you have that disenchanted look that seems above the mundane.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [What disenchanted look? I see her as a retired security guard.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...Pfft.”
 

 
“What’s wrong?” The manager, who was discussing the variety show details with Tong Zhao, looked over with concern as she suddenly burst into laughter.
 

 
Tong Zhao covered her mouth with her hand and pulled out a versatile reply: “I just thought of something happy.”
 

 
She really couldn’t help it; she wanted to laugh out loud.
 

 
“Seeing you laugh makes me happy too,” Sister Chu said. “Come and take a look at the flying guest spoilers prepared by the production team.”
 

 
@OneLifeSurvivor:
 

 
#OneLifeSurvivor# Guess who the flying guest is for the next episode.
 

 
[Silhouette]
 

 
The figure in the silhouette is tall, and the long sword at their waist is a recognizable feature.
 

 
At first, no one recognized it as Tong Zhao; they didn't dare to guess it was her. She has been quite popular lately. Would she really come to this kind of grueling variety show? It seemed unnecessary for her to participate; it would be much more comfortable to join lighthearted shows filled with food, drink, and entertainment while still maintaining her fanbase.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans often say that their idol works too hard and hope her manager can arrange some easier gigs for her.
 

 
“Stop scheduling activities that involve losing limbs or digging for bullets all the time.”
 

 
The manager felt quite wronged.
 

 
After the spoiler tweet was posted for a while, some sharp-eyed netizens thought the silhouette looked familiar. They compared it with screenshots from "The Heartless Tribulation," and surprisingly, they lined up perfectly. This netizen posted the comparison in the comments, and it was quickly shared on forums. Other netizens were skeptical but also felt there was some logic to it—
 

 
[Not to mention, this variety show really has that girl’s style.]
 

 
[Fan: My heart aches for my sister QAQ. Tong Zhao: Is there any other way to torture me? Hurry up.]
 

 
[#The last female celebrity who doesn't need fans to feel sorry for her#]
 

 
[What is she doing on this variety show? If she goes, is there still a way for others to survive?]
 

 
"In One Life Survives," there are twenty contestants each episode.
 

 
They form groups of four and must survive on a deserted island for fifteen days. They face not only the challenges of hunger and thirst but also the potential dangers from wild animals. The production team will periodically drop limited supplies to encourage conflict and competition among the teams, leading to mutual elimination.
 

 
It’s essentially a real-life, team-based version of PUBG.
 

 
If a guest is attacked by a beast, there will be a struggle period. If there are no teammates to defeat the beast or escape successfully, the system will directly determine them as dead, without any additional physical pain or gruesome scenes of being bitten.
 

 
The firearms issued have real lethal force when hitting wild animals, but when they hit other contestants, they are simply paintballs. Depending on the area hit, there will be corresponding negative effects—for example, if a contestant is hit in the knee by a paintball, they won’t feel any pain aside from a slight jolt, but they will be deemed hit and thus unable to move that leg.
 

 
Therefore, aiming for the legs to incapacitate them is a viable strategy in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
After the holographic technology matured, this type of survival variety show sprang up like mushrooms after rain.
 

 
However, there aren't many stars willing to participate, especially idols.
 

 
Those who are delicate and precious will get teary-eyed with just a slight bump; if they endure even a little hardship, they’ll buy marketing campaigns to maintain their image. Participating in such a variety show would be self-inflicted suffering and ruin their reputation. Fans also don’t want to see them suffer, so this type of show is generally reserved for tough-guy male stars, who can come in, dominate the competition, and immediately gain a large male audience's favor.
 

 
Long Jue, the top rising star, became an instant sensation in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
Originally a young man working on a construction site while dealing with family debt, Long Jue had trained in martial arts before his family fell on hard times. He stepped in at the last minute for a missing contestant due to illness. His ability to endure hardship and fight was fully displayed on the show, particularly in a scene where he was wearing a black tank top, washing off sweat and blood under a waterfall, which left countless viewers breathless.
 

 
His chest and biceps were incredibly impressive.
 

 
When he dove into the water and raised his head, slicking his hair back, his handsome and strong face caught the audience's attention, revealing him as a hidden gem. After the show ended, he was immediately signed by an entertainment company, and his experience on "In One Life Survives" made him successful during auditions for tough-guy roles.
 

 
[Those who got into "Countdown 72 Hours" are really looking forward to seeing Tong Zhao's strong "true self" again.]
 

 
[72 Hours 1]
 

 
Tong Zhao's strong subconscious is evident in "Countdown 72 Hours."
 

 
Initially, netizens were quite surprised that a rising female star would be willing to participate in a survival variety show. As discussions went on, they began to feel excited about it, though there were also male users on a male-dominated forum who were openly mocking her—
 

 
“Seriously, are there really female stars who think they can thrive in a survival variety show?”
 

 
“Friendly reminder: in a survival variety show, no one gets special treatment like in movies.”
 

 
“Click to see confident comments from Chinese female fans.”
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has had a group of male haters.
 

 
Her PR team and manager analyzed that it's mostly born from love turning to hate.
 

 
The character she portrayed, the imperial concubine, can be considered a heartthrob killer, attracting a significant number of male fans. Many on that forum refer to her as their wife, believing that having her makes them feel like emperors. Given that the survival genre often depicts a character's journey from being a newcomer to facing life-changing experiences...
 

 
Tong Zhao has chosen to play Feng Yanqi.
 

 
Her portrayal of a cold and fierce woman shattered some male fans' delicate hearts.
 

 
At first, they criticized her manager for taking on too many roles.
 

 
But when they realized Tong Zhao was willingly accepting these roles, they felt she wasn't listening to advice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's patriarchal mindset reflects the sentiments of many men—
 

 
You have to listen to me; I understand a lot, and I am the truth of the world. If you don’t listen to me, something bad will happen.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t run into trouble; instead, everything she acted in became a hit, and her new film ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had a great box office success, showcasing a cold demeanor that didn’t rely on men.
 

 
This instantly triggered those male fans, turning them into die-hard haters, hoping she would fail.
 

 
Seeing her take on a highly challenging role in the male-dominated survival variety show In ‘One Life Survives’, they immediately got excited. On one hand, they felt their masculinity was being insulted, while on the other, they were relieved that she dared to take on anything, giving them a chance to mock her.
 

 
"Rational Discussion: What Gave Tong Zhao the Confidence to Venture into Survival Variety Shows?"
 

 
Original poster:
 

 
“From randomly taking on post-apocalyptic films to hitting it big, someone has tasted the sweet fruit of a fierce woman image. After listening to her fans' uncritical praise, she feels like she can take on five at once, forgetting how she got here—wasn’t it by flattering men as the imperial concubine?
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao makes me think of those soft support girls I encounter when I’m playing ranked matches...
 

 
Getting carried to diamond rank by the wild king brother and occasionally winning MVP, they start to think they’re really at that level.
 

 
It’s not that I’m misogynistic; let’s let the data speak.
 

 
Survival variety shows generally lack female guests; even if they go, they’re just dragging everyone down. Tong Zhao’s fans shouldn’t be too quick to curse me. Your sister has such a beautiful face; do you really want to see her ruin her image? Isn’t it better for her to be a beautiful little fairy or a little princess? She could do great in shows like ‘Sea King Kill’.”
 

 
The provocative original post, which wore the guise of a rational discussion, quickly became a hot thread that represented the mainstream voice of this forum.
 

 
At first glance, it seemed to make a lot of sense.
 

 
Tong Zhao is indeed beautiful, and some fans hope she maintains a delicate and beautiful image, participating in leisurely and fun variety shows.
 

 
The original poster felt that their comments were quite reasonable.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans, unable to accept this, were labeled as mindless defenders who couldn’t grasp the situation.
 

 
Data analysis also showed that after Tong Zhao took on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, the male percentage in her fan base slightly decreased.
 

 
However, some male users held a different opinion: “I admire Tong Zhao for being willing to take on various challenging roles, which is why I became her fan. Why do you insist on demanding that an independent and strong woman fit your idea of a delicate flower?”
 

 
The same argument had different responses in different places.
 

 
On Weibo, Tong Zhao, who severed her father-daughter relationship, was met with sympathy from netizens.
 

 
The mainstream opinion felt she was strong, unaffected by her weak mother, and impressively independent.
 

 
On the cat forum, however, this was seen as a black mark against her.
 

 
There were plenty of posts expressing that if their daughter were a fan of Tong Zhao, they would break her legs to stop her from emulating an idol who easily disowns her father like an ungrateful wolf.
 

 
Bias often shapes perception; one's position determines their thoughts.
 

 
This topic intensified, fueled by some who wanted to bring Tong Zhao down, creating a spectacle for their competitors while causing more trouble, spreading to Weibo.
 

 
They claimed that fans were resisting Tong Zhao appearing on ‘In One Life Survives’.
 

 
The fans looked completely bewildered.
 

 
They immediately went to check the original post that was shared and felt even more wronged than Dou E.
 

 
[... We don't want Zhao Zhao to suffer, but we never thought of her like that!]
 

 
[Please, straight male cancer, if you can’t handle a female actress being tough, don’t drag us into it, okay?]
 

 
[I’m a male fan, and I feel really wronged; I suggest removing this brain-dead person from the male ranks.]
 

 
[Ugh, I can’t take it. I really hope Tong Zhao survives until the end and slaps those self-confident boys in the face.]
 

 
Normal male fans felt unjustly treated and couldn’t understand this group’s mindset.
 

 
In ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, Tong Zhao was indeed fierce, yet she remained beautiful; when she was shooting with the gun, she was undeniably sexy—especially for otaku who loved mobile games like ‘Girls' Frontline’, who all referred to her as the gun girl of their dreams, feeling as if she had stepped out of the 2D world as a Valkyrie.
 

 
Different strokes for different folks.
 

 
But these haters didn’t feel the same way; they adored Tong Zhao’s performance in ‘Emperor Ming’ and believed she had gone astray, criticizing her for her own good. Couldn’t the fans see how many boyfriend fans she had when she performed in ‘Emperor Ming’?
 

 
For these haters, seeing Tong Zhao was like watching their delicate wives go to work as a strong woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were infuriated, but looking at the data…
 

 
It seemed that survival variety shows really had very few female guests!
 

 
And even fewer had outstanding performances.
 

 
However, some fans countered with solid arguments—
 

 
Although the physical fitness of female guests may be lacking, their emotional stability is quite high, unlike what some male netizens say about them easily breaking down. They also move very cautiously and carefully. There was a winning team that managed to survive because one female guest remembered to erase their traces in the jungle.
 

 
Haters:
 

 
[Oh, so your sister plans to survive by avoiding confrontation?]
 

 
[Then we’re not wrong; she might as well go to a relaxing variety show where she can shine. If she spends the whole time avoiding confrontation without getting a single shot, isn’t that just a waste of time? How long is a female actor’s golden period? Isn’t it a waste for her to spend it avoiding confrontation like a coward?]
 

 
...
 

 
It seems there’s some truth to that.
 

 
Some more influential fan leaders advised fans not to get too worked up. If someone made a claim like, “Tong Zhao will lead the team to victory in the variety show,” and a screenshot was taken by someone with ill intentions, only for her not to deliver in the end, that would be quite embarrassing.
 

 
Isn’t it unfair to raise expectations for sister?
 

 
Don’t give the haters attention; let them go crazy. Zhao Zhao is a woman they can never have.
 

 
With such a big uproar, Tong Zhao naturally knew about it.
 

 
The production team was thrilled; the natural buzz surrounding her made other variety shows that didn’t invite Tong Zhao jealous. Some with darker minds were already hoping she wouldn’t perform as well as the haters claimed.
 

 
The female journalist humorously commented: “Is this the power of the national disaster beauty? Little Chen should reflect on this.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke more harshly than the fans defending Tong Zhao against the haters: “All I can say is that there have always been such fools in every era. They don’t consider that if it were an era of imperial authority, my beauty would be something they could only covet. Everyone thinks they could be the emperor; I should be their beloved concubine. But if we were to dream back to ancient times, their only chance to interact with me would be to enter the palace as eunuchs.”
 

 
Tong Zhao found it hilarious and was in a great mood.
 

 
No one could ruin her mindset; it was all related to her.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Alright, don’t be upset. I’ll find a way to support you.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I’m not upset; men can’t get to me. The only one who can truly anger me is that cultivator.”
 

 
Female journalist: “Do you know how many people are going to comment ‘I’m shipping this’ after you say that?”
 

 
With Duan Ge backing her up, Concubine Chen was happy again.
 

 
Duan Ge: “As long as you’re not angry, that’s good. But I’m a little upset.”
 

 
Online, some of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t stand the backlash and secretly sent her encouraging messages in private and comments, hoping she could lead her teammates to victory and slap the haters in the face. In situations like this, the best response is not to engage, and the fans understood that.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s response shattered their hopes—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
“I’m sorry, but it’s impossible to lead my teammates to victory in #OneSurvives#.”
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[Why is sister saying such pessimistic things????]
 

 
Just as the haters were about to celebrate, the production team of “One Survives” retweeted.
 

 
@OneSurvives v:
 

 
“Because @Sister Tong Zhao is serving as the hunter for this episode of survival!”
 

 
An external trial officer for a group of twenty.
 

 
Unlike other teams that can muddle through to victory, the hunter's only winning condition is to eliminate everyone. They have no teammates, and for every person they eliminate, they receive supplies for one day. Theoretically, there’s no need to search for food; they only need to find people.
 

 
Lead teammates to victory?
 

 
Impossible, because Tong Zhao has no teammates.
 

 
Both the haters and the fans were stunned.
# Chapter66
“Did you hear that Tong Zhao is coming? Is it true?”
 

 
“It’s true; it’s already officially announced.”
 

 
“I heard she was only supposed to come for two days, but then it changed. Who knows what she’s after.”
 

 
“Then we have to help her out, right?”
 

 
At the filming site of ‘OneLifeSurvivor’, three ordinary guests huddled in a corner, discussing quietly.
 

 
Even with a 24-hour survival show, there’s still some room for behind-the-scenes manipulation.
 

 
It’s just much less than traditional variety shows.
 

 
In survival-type shows, if a certain guest's physical capabilities are enhanced—like when everyone is getting rained on and drinking raw water—only that guest won’t suffer from headaches or fevers. Or if the same food supplies are available, one specific guest might feel fuller than the others, giving them an invisible advantage.
 

 
However, the audience for survival shows seeks a sense of realism, so such behind-the-scenes interference is rare...
 

 
Or rather, it’s very well-kept secret, with few leaks.
 

 
“Who knows?”
 

 
When Tong Zhao was mentioned, the two shrugged dismissively, and one added, “Director Chen wouldn’t dare to go too far. If the complaint rate exceeds 40%, the backend data has to be made public. The show’s ratings are good; why would they ruin their reputation for a publicity-seeking female star?”
 

 
The remaining person looked a bit embarrassed: “I actually like Tong Zhao, so don’t say that about her.”
 

 
“Why do you like her? Is she going to ruin your own rice bowl?”
 

 
...
 

 
As soon as the words left their mouths, Director Chen walked in through the door.
 

 
He was no longer the aloof figure he usually presented to his subordinates; instead, he wore a smile on his face. “I can’t feel at ease for even a moment when I don’t see anyone.”
 

 
Walking beside Director Chen was a tall, slender woman.
 

 
“I’ve always been on time.”
 

 
Her voice was a bit cold. Dressed in sporty casual clothes with sneakers and a baseball cap, she wore an outfit that, while suitable for sweating it out on the sports field and not showing off her figure, made it clear that she had model-like proportions with her long legs. Even if she wore a burlap sack, she could easily be ready to strut down a runway.
 

 
When people see a good figure, they can’t help but imagine she must be beautiful.
 

 
When she took off her black cat-ear hat, the other guests couldn’t help but have their hearts skip a beat.
 

 
It was really Tong Zhao!
 

 
They had known for a while that a very beautiful female star would be coming today—the recent splash screen advertisement on Weibo was for ‘Heartless Tribulation’, and with Tong Zhao’s rising popularity, anyone in the film industry, even a temporary actor, couldn’t possibly have not heard of her or seen her photos.
 

 
These guests, who often frequented the film city, had long been accustomed to handsome men and beautiful women.
 

 
To stand out among so many attractive faces, Tong Zhao’s looks had to be remarkable.
 

 
The guests who had been whispering and speaking dismissively about her fell silent in unison, turning their attention to her with respect.
 

 
The smile at the corners of her lips was faint.
 

 
Director Chen wanted to say something else to her but couldn’t think of a topic, so he moved aside to put on the protective gear provided on-site—knee pads, elbow protectors, and fingerless gloves.
 

 
The film city, primarily focused on survival variety shows, was built on the outskirts, encompassing a large area.
 

 
This setup was intended to ensure that when the guests took breaks from the cabin, there wouldn't be a significant environmental contrast that could cause psychological discrepancies. After waking up in the cabin, they would still see green mountains and clear waters outside their dormitory windows, accompanied by the sounds of birds and the fragrance of flowers. The location rented for ‘One Life Survivor’ included a site for artificial off-road challenges, where a warm-up activity would be conducted before filming, allowing the audience to observe the physical fitness levels of the guests in real life.
 

 
There was no way to alter the backend data in reality!
 

 
Director Chen really dared to go this far.
 

 
The crowd couldn't help but steal a few more glances at Tong Zhao.
 

 
After she skillfully donned the protective gear, she began to stretch and warm up in place.
 

 
"She looks pretty serious."
 

 
Guest No. 7 muttered.
 

 
"Maybe she really has some skills; otherwise, why would she dare to come? If she shows off a bit during the warm-up, it would make sense to alter the data later," another seasoned guest, often seen on survival variety shows, whispered. Her black knee pads accentuated her long legs, which looked snow-white and delicate, making him swallow hard.
 

 
While the other guests quietly gossiped about Tong Zhao, she was completely oblivious.
 

 
After all, the noise in her mind was loud enough.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “There are so many men here!”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Are you happy?”
 

 
Lu Yingchen: “I wake up in a place like this…”
 

 
Lu Yingchen couldn't hide his disgust and wanted to clear the place with a single sword stroke.
 

 
“Happy my ass! It’s infuriating! I shouldn’t have come to this place; it’s an insult to my eyes,”
 
Concubine Chen said, fanning herself with a peacock-feather fan, covering half of her beautiful face. “Let me reiterate, I only accept the best men in the world. Not just any good, definitely not mediocre—only the best will do.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke with an arrogance born from being spoiled.
 

 
She wasn’t targeting anyone in particular; she considered all the men present to be trash.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted Lu Yingchen: “Why don’t you rest a bit longer? Duan Ge (brother) will cover for you here.”
 

 
They had previously considered who should participate in the survival variety show.
 

 
After all, Lu Yingchen’s outdoor survival skills were quite strong; she had lived in the jungle for a long time before restoring her cultivation, much like a monk in training. She had done all sorts of exaggerated things often seen in anime, like meditating under a waterfall and challenging wild black bears—her ethereal aura had come later.
 

 
If she lacked capability, how could she remain untarnished?
 

 
But later, upon looking up the guests for the survival show, Tong Zhao knew that there would be many men. She was aware that Lu Yingchen didn’t like this kind of environment. Even if she said she could handle it, it didn’t matter; she wouldn’t be willing to.
 

 
If she didn’t cherish her own character, who would cherish it for her?
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been the one who valued herself the most.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t speak. She had been unhappy ever since the negative comments about Lu Yingchen started circulating online.
 

 
One, she felt pity for Concubine Chen being coveted by a group of lowly people.
 

 
Thinking about it, the haters who favor Concubine Chen and resist Tong Zhao's participation in other roles are really trying to sow discord between their different personalities. To put it bluntly, it’s like demanding that a girlfriend or daughter be virtuous and gentle, molding them into what they want like clay, erasing any aspect they dislike.
 

 
They love her for being delicate and charming but hate her for being strong and fierce.
 

 
And they never consider that both the delicate and the strong sides are just facets of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Do they want Tong Zhao to erase some of her traits just to please them?
 

 
That's impossible. Not only will she not give them the satisfaction, but she will also continue to walk her own path.
 

 
Additionally, due to being immersed in a war-torn apocalypse, Duan Ge's hostility is heavier than that of other personalities, and it’s impossible for her to vent her anger at her sisters during this survival variety show. Tong Zhao agreed to change her participation from two days to one episode for this reason—both the production team and she felt they were leveraging each other, achieving a win-win situation.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Well, I’m going to sleep now. Wake me up when you’re done having fun with the body.”
 

 
Duan Ge chuckled lightly and replied, “Okay.”
 

 
……
 

 
"One Life Survivor" is a live-streamed variety show.
 

 
Similar to "Countdown 72 Hours," it has both post-edited versions and 24-hour live broadcasts.
 

 
The warm-up activity consists of a four-person group completing an obstacle course challenge.
 

 
The first task is a basic 1,000-meter run on grass, followed by climbing an artificial rock wall, a short hurdle race, crossing an artificial lake, completing a rope net climb, and then facing various minor challenges, finishing with a 200-meter swim…
 

 
The shorter the time it takes to complete, the better the score.
 

 
Of course, if someone can’t finish, there’s no need to force themselves; they can withdraw partway and still participate in subsequent segments of the variety show.
 

 
The show itself has decent popularity, and with Tong Zhao joining this episode, the viewership for the warm-up activities has already reached six figures and is continuing to rise. This is also why the show has chosen to have Tong Zhao make her appearance last… They’re worried that once she completes her challenge, the audience will leave, so they’re keeping her as a highlight to hold the viewers' attention.
 

 
[Where’s Tong Zhao? When is she coming out? I came to see her.]
 

 
[Why hasn’t she shown up yet?]
 

 
[I suggest we fast-forward to Tong Zhao’s appearance!!!]
 

 
[Wow, there are really so few female guests, I’m a bit worried about Zhao Zhao QAQ]
 

 
The frequency data of keywords in the comments clearly demonstrates Tong Zhao's commercial value.
 

 
Regardless of the evaluations, netizens are simply curious about her.
 

 
Actors often repeat the same type of roles, just like an author who only writes one genre. While this can stabilize their fan base and provide a steady income, it can also lead to fatigue—it's difficult to keep all audiences consistently engaged in the same tone over a long period. However, as long as they handle this well, they can earn significant wealth.
 

 
Tong Zhao changes her style with every film she makes; some people criticize her for being too unconventional, but one has to admit that this is also a way to maintain freshness.
 

 
……
 

 
At this moment, the crew member came over to call her: “Sister Zhao, it’s almost your turn.”
 

 
The host smiled at the camera and encouraged Tong Zhao:
 

 
“If you feel like you can’t hold on anymore, you can immediately press the emergency button on your watch, and a medical team will come to take you for a rest. Remember to know your limits, okay, miss?”
 

 
Prior to this, he had added Tong Zhao on WeChat and greeted her, saying he would make some provocative comments for the sake of the show’s effect.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood immediately.
 

 
Of course, the production team was racking their brains for explosive moments, and the host was just a worker; she wouldn’t make things difficult for him. She simply replied that she understood and told him to say whatever he wanted, but her fans might go after him, so he had to be careful.
 

 
[If the host can’t speak properly, he should just shut up.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's fans are getting anxious? Advising her to know her limits is for her own good? Got it, some people’s fans are all elementary school kids who don’t understand kind advice.]
 

 
[Even though I think what the host said was unpleasant, I also hope the sister knows her limits. There are male guests ahead who are exhausted and can’t complete the tasks; there’s no need to push herself...]
 

 
The comments were buzzing, and a debate erupted.
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her eyelids and glanced at him.
 

 
That dark and silent glance cast a chilling and deadly aura over her beautifully shaped eyes.
 

 
The host's smiling face froze.
 

 
Humans are all part of the same species, yet there are a hundred different types. A student standing in front of their teacher will behave obediently under a gaze, while a fugitive will have their heart race at just a glance from someone in a police uniform. There is a theory of mutual suppression between people; herbivores will never get to eat meat in their lifetimes. Just putting on a wolf's skin won’t change that.
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really that intimidating?
 

 
The host felt dazed by her gaze, like a noisy sheep being caught by a disgruntled tiger ready to bite into its carotid artery, contemplating whether to give it a quick end.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
Duan Ge, a beat behind, flipped through Tong Zhao's memories to find their WeChat chat records, remembering that this person was only speaking oddly for work purposes…
 

 
The fierce aura that seemed to be ready to devour someone suddenly froze.
 

 
It was as if the sharp teeth of a wild beast were pressing against her skin but had stopped their advance.
 

 
The eyes that had been shrouded in hostility cleared slightly, as if the clouds had parted.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
These three words were spoken with the same coldness as “Get lost and stop bothering me.”
 

 
“Okay, okay! Good luck, miss!”
 

 
The host, who had originally prepared a barrage of strange remarks, dared not utter another word and obediently retreated.
 

 
The challenge involved completing the obstacle course in groups of four, and the first five groups had already finished.
 

 
The best time was 10 minutes and 07 seconds, achieved by a male guest, number 16, who usually trained in long-distance running and looked like a potential star athlete.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the final contestant, and there would be solo camera shots of her throughout.
 

 
Several guests who dreamed of standing out in the survival variety show and joining the ranks of celebrities cast envious and jealous glances at her as she stood at the starting line. The various complex gazes seemed to pierce into her, but unfortunately, she stood too far forward for them to look her in the eye—
 

 
And Duan Ge would never look back.
 

 
“Get in position,”
 

 
“Ready—”
 

 
[Tong Zhao, go!]
 

 
[That figure is incredible! When she crouches in the starting position, her legs have muscle! How come I never noticed this before? She looks so good; I want to be squeezed to death by her thighs.] After this comment was posted, the fan who clicked on it angrily found out it was from a girl, so it was all good.
 

 
As the gun fired, her slender figure shot out like an arrow.
 

 
This body was a bit more delicate than the one Duan Ge used during the apocalypse, but Tong Zhao had consistently practiced her cultivation techniques since returning, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. This not only made her skin and overall condition nearly perfect but also strengthened her physique. She didn’t pursue a fragile “ideal body”; she had all the muscles she needed, and now was the time to put them to use.
 

 
If it came down to physical ability, Tong Zhao’s body was not much worse than that of a male athlete.
 

 
Duan Ge was also a good runner.
 

 
She understood exactly when to sprint in a kilometer, when to pace herself, and how to regulate her breathing.
 

 
This wasn’t something learned from a gym teacher.
 

 
It was experience gained from being chased by zombies; different paths led to the same destination.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team could be considered humane.
 

 
The afternoon sun was abundant, not scorching enough to make one feel dizzy. The light fell on Duan Ge as she ran on the track, like a layer of golden powder laid over her fair skin, dazzling to the eyes. This scene put many of her fans at ease.
 

 
A strong sister is certainly impressive.
 

 
However, beauty fans are quite real; they love that face and hope their idol looks beautiful in everything she does. They fear seeing her unflattering moments and unfollowing her—this group is common and is like those online who shout, “You can trick me with a fake photo, but please don’t scare me with a real selfie.”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao looking so beautiful during high-intensity exercise reassured her beauty fans!
 

 
[Mom asked why my screen is wet.]
 

 
[? GHS?]
 

 
[It's because I couldn't help but lick the screen when I saw the beautiful sister!]
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t think about the effect of the show.
 

 
She had never been a star; at most, she would remember that she was an artist now and should pay attention to her image. But deliberately running beautifully? That was impossible. Her thinking was very practical; the reason she looked good was simply that she was too comfortable and effortless.
 

 
This cross-country challenge was not just a test of physical ability but also the difficulty of switching between various activities.
 

 
One moment she had to run, the next she had to climb a wall, then hurdle, and then swim...
 

 
But for someone who had survived in the apocalypse, wasn’t this quite normal?
 

 
She didn’t even have to turn back to shoot zombies.
 

 
Watching Duan Ge complete the challenge, it was hard for not just the onlookers but even her fans to feel anxious.
 

 
They had initially been quite worried about her.
 

 
As a result, after watching for a while, they completely forgot their nerves and started admiring her beauty.
 

 
A significant portion of her fans had a strong admiration for strength. Tong Zhao's fanbase mainly consisted of career-oriented supporters, which was even more of a group that idolized strength. Watching their sister complete the challenge effortlessly and gracefully filled them with pride.
 

 
"Whoosh!"
 

 
When Duan Ge reached the finish line, the recorded completion time on screen was 10 minutes and 17 seconds.
 

 
That was only 10 seconds slower than the first place.
 

 
That was already incredible.
 

 
After all, the physical differences between men and women are objective and not discriminatory. Sports exams have different standards for men and women; if a unified standard were applied, it would be a form of invisible discrimination.
 

 
After swimming the two hundred meters, Duan Ge pressed her hands against the edge of the pool, pushing her upper body out of the water.
 

 
To facilitate movement, she had her hair tied up in a high ponytail today, which now hung down her back, wet and resembling a soft whip. Duan Ge was dressed quite conservatively and knew she would be entering the water, so she wore materials that wouldn’t become transparent when wet, showcasing the elegant lines of her shoulder blades. She looked like a dragon leaping from the surface of the water, embodying the cold and noble dragon maiden imagined by the people of China.
 

 
[...I’m dead. Thank you, production team, for arranging the wet segment!]
 

 
[Someone is desperately requesting Tong Zhao to play the princess of the Dragon Palace in the East Sea.]
 

 
[Princess? This is clearly a queen!]
 

 
This was the beauty fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Onlookers, especially those who loved survival variety shows, were shocked by Tong Zhao's performance.
 

 
[Does looks matter? The real issue is that Tong Zhao’s speed is incredible!]
 

 
[Is this a river raccoon? This is clearly not a river raccoon! Can her muscle mass support such intense exercise?]
 

 
[...Shocking my entire gym.]
 

 
Some stubborn individuals insisted on recording this segment to time it with their own stopwatch, refusing to believe that Tong Zhao was that fast. Those less adamant began to make jokes—previously, Tong Zhao had been jokingly suggested by netizens to get her brain checked due to her unique subconscious; this time, it seemed like she needed a full physical examination as well.
 

 
What others thought didn’t concern Duan Ge, nor did she have any interest in knowing.
 

 
After leaving the swimming pool, an assistant immediately draped a towel over her shoulders and handed her a hot drink.
 

 
"Thank you."
 

 
Duan Ge turned and smiled at the young assistant.
 

 
She was as fierce with the male host as she was gentle with the female assistant.
 

 
"You're too polite, Sister Zhao."
 

 
The assistant quickly waved her hand, blushing as she stayed by Duan Ge's side, waiting for her to finish drinking before collecting the thermos cup. She didn’t understand what was happening; despite working with Tong Zhao every day, she found her especially charming at that moment. Just a simple thank-you made her heart race.
 

 
What’s going on?!
 

 
She was straight!
 

 
The assistant strongly reminded herself.
 

 
The assistant's racing heart wasn't an isolated phenomenon; nearly 70% of the comments in the live chat mentioned that they were charmed, with the remaining 30% being male viewers who were drawn in. Some had even started researching how to work alongside Tong Zhao, thinking that they could also fetch water and hand over towels! They wanted to hear their sister say thank you in person!
 

 
The other guests at the event had long since collapsed from exhaustion after completing the challenge.
 

 
Even if they couldn't lie down to rest immediately, most were doing gentle exercises to bring their heart rate and blood pressure back to normal levels.
 

 
The performance of other competitors during the guests’ commentary was also a major highlight of the show, so there was a huge screen on site displaying the live footage.
 

 
The contestants, who had originally been chatting aimlessly, all raised their heads to look at the big screen as Tong Zhao began her challenge.
 

 
At first, their curiosity was mixed with malice.
 

 
But the more they watched, the more they couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Tong Zhao might not be the fastest, but she definitely ran the most gracefully.
 

 
Everyone found it hard to believe that she could run so effortlessly, especially since they had all just completed challenges that they knew were exhausting—while they had anticipated that the tests would challenge their stamina, they had not expected to feel completely spent afterward.
 

 
And Tong Zhao was even able to manage her expressions!?
 

 
What incredible professionalism!
 

 
“Wow, is she even human?”
 

 
“Hey, Lao Song, stop drinking water and look at the screen…”
 

 
In the rest area, all the guests instinctively started talking about the same person, their eyes glued to the screen showing the final challenger. When she completed her challenge, the time record flashed on the screen in exaggerated effects, accompanied by sound effects, and they all fell silent.
 

 
When the host asked the other guests for their thoughts, surprisingly, there were very few malicious comments.
 

 
They were stunned.
 

 
Host: “Now that you've seen Tong Zhao’s preliminary challenge, do you feel confident about being her opponent?”
 

 
The male guest answered instantly: “No.”
 

 
“Ah? Why not?”
 

 
“I feel like she could take me out without any expression.”
 

 
The host also asked the female guest who had given up midway and slowly completed the challenge. She replied in a standard manner, “Tong Zhao is much better than me. It’s a pity that she’s in the hunter role; otherwise, I would really want to be her teammate.”
 

 
This sentiment echoed the thoughts of most people.
 

 
After all, the winning team would receive extra bonuses, and they would have a greater chance of being favored by the production team for future survival variety shows.
 

 
No one mentioned the idea of manipulating the data anymore.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's current abilities, if they were to manipulate it again, she would have to be a Super Saiyan, right?
 

 
The preliminary event came to a successful conclusion, and the top three would receive a mysterious reward to aid in their survival on the show.
 

 
The first-place male guest looked at Duan Ge with a complex expression.
 

 
He was only ten seconds behind the young lady, and suddenly, the first-place spot didn’t seem so appealing.
 

 
“What did you say???"
 

 
After the modeling team leader ran over to Director Chen and said a few words, Director Chen’s expression changed dramatically.
 

 
Duan Ge was sitting close enough to hear their conversation clearly.
 

 
The map for each episode of ‘One Life Survivor’ would change, and the planned deserted island map had a bug that couldn’t be fixed quickly: “How could it not be fixable? If there’s a bug, just fix it!”
 

 
“No, that bug is a special kind; identifying it will take a lot of time.”
 

 
Duan Ge was stretching when Han Zhi’s sigh echoed in her mind: [Why does something go wrong every time we do a variety show?]
 

 
Last time during ‘Sea King Killer’, there was an unexpected incident that forced him to step in at the last minute.
 

 
It was impossible to delay the shoot, and killing the director wouldn’t solve anything.
 

 
After thinking for a while, Director Chen decided to change the map: “How many maps do we have that aren’t past their copyright?”
 

 
The popular wilderness themes were gone, leaving only an urban map and a Western fantasy castle.
 

 
Director Chen pressed his forehead and made a decisive call:
 

 
“Then let’s go with the urban map. Don’t bother fixing the bug; just identify it and report it to the uploading party, asking them to compensate for the filming costs!”
 

 
“Okay!”
 

 
Duan Ge quietly finished her stretching exercises.
 

 
In her mind, the Concubine Chen was puzzled, thinking: [Isn’t the urban map your strong suit? You should be happy!]
 

 
[No…]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m just wondering if this might be a bit too unfair for others.]
# Chapter67
When the director announced the change of map, the entire venue erupted in uproar.
 

 
After all, the "home-field advantage" is a real thing.
 

 
Among the attendees, several competitors might not excel physically but had plenty of experience in outdoor survival—children raised in rural areas had certain advantages on a deserted island, while muscles built in the gym might not be much help in the jungle.
 

 
"Why the sudden change?"
 

 
"I heard there's a bug in the deserted island map."
 

 
"What kind of bug? If it's not serious, can't we just make do?"
 

 
A host who usually livestreams cooking and advertising quietly complained, "With the map change, I’ve lost my advantage."
 

 
"It's pretty serious. Apparently, a member of the development team slacked off and reused some ancient data, which caused all the T-Rex eggs to hatch on the island. There's no time to check the data, and if we use this map, we not only have to battle wild animals but also outsmart and outfight T-Rexes..."
 

 
It's gone from "National Geographic Channel" to "Jurassic Park."
 

 
The competitor who previously said it could be made to work fell silent for a moment, then grumbled, "Fine."
 

 
They had to accept reality.
 

 
They had signed performance contracts, and unless there were uncontrollable factors, they couldn't withdraw without paying a hefty penalty, as it's practically impossible for the show to bring in replacements last minute.
 

 
[The T-Rex is killing me with laughter!]
 

 
[I want to see Tong Zhao battle the T-Rex!]
 

 
[This bug… it really shows that one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch in any industry. Luckily it was discovered in time; otherwise, finding out that a survival show turned into a dinosaur cooking show right before filming would be a huge loss.]
 

 
The entire production team was relieved.
 

 
However...
 

 
After the announcement, Director Chen sat down beside Duan Ge with a big smile: "Sister Zhao, you heard the situation just now."
 

 
Tong Zhao's situation was different from the others.
 

 
She was a special invited guest, and her contract was drafted separately. The sudden map change was a breach of contract by the producers, giving her the right to leave without filming.
 

 
Everyone else watched her with eager eyes.
 

 
When the map change was announced, Duan Ge's usually calm expression showed significant signs of wavering—everyone was paying too much attention to her, even catching the slightest change in her demeanor.
 

 
Was she scared?
 

 
Although the black-box operation to change the data wasn't particularly difficult, a sudden map change would surely have some impact.
 

 
Some competitors couldn't help but speculate.
 

 
While they had preliminary activity data, being able to run and jump was completely different from surviving in extreme environments; otherwise, athletes could easily transition to special forces.
 

 
"Yes," Duan Ge nodded. "I heard.”
 

 
...
 

 
And then?
 

 
There was no "and then." Duan Ge watched him quietly, waiting for him to continue speaking.
 

 
She showed no intention of taking a stance.
 

 
In fact, Duan Ge knew he was testing her attitude—even in the apocalypse, she wasn't just a mindless brute relying solely on force. Being a leader required a good grasp of emotional intelligence. However, her mood was currently poor, and the director had just hit a nerve.
 

 
She wouldn't lash out at just anyone, but if he had something to say, he should be direct.
 

 
Tong Zhao was in a bad mood today...
 

 
Chen Director speculated, but he also sensed the other contestants' unfriendliness towards her.
 

 
Who could maintain a good temper in such an environment?
 

 
There were plenty of big-name stars who loved to throw tantrums and act aloof, making cold faces and asserting their presence was not uncommon. Tong Zhao had previously seemed approachable enough to give him the impression of "maybe I can take advantage of her." But now, with that icy glare, he quickly dismissed his earlier underestimation. He wiped the flattering smile off his face and earnestly explained the situation, sincerely apologizing and hoping she would stay.
 

 
After speaking, Director Chen was sweating profusely.
 

 
He had mentally prepared himself for Tong Zhao to explode and say she wouldn't film anymore.
 

 
After all, Director Chen knew very well that there was no black-box operation to favor Tong Zhao; her performance depended solely on herself. The public pressure she was under was immense. If she could find an excuse to walk away, it would be understandable... While she might have confidence in wilderness survival, she might not feel the same about a city map!
 

 
An easy excuse had just been handed to her.
 

 
[Tong Zhao doesn’t want to film anymore?]
 

 
[This map change is way too sudden; who would be happy about that?]
 

 
[Only she has objections while the other contestants unanimously agree? Is she really that noble?]
 

 
Those who questioned were immediately countered by more informed viewers—
 

 
[Exactly! In terms of this variety show, she is "noble" because her contract is different. A last-minute map change generally constitutes a breach of contract, giving her the right to opt out. Didn’t you see that some contestants also had concerns? Everyone came prepared for survival on a deserted island... It’s like a science student taking a liberal arts exam, got it?]
 

 
This analogy was easier to understand.
 

 
But then the comments quickly turned into a debate about the differences between the deserted island and city maps.
 

 
...
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay, no problem.”
 

 
“We really hope…”
 

 
Director Chen's persuasive words were on the tip of his tongue but then paused, realizing that the other party had readily agreed: “Huh?”
 

 
“A map change is fine,” Duan Ge patiently explained. “I thought you were going to mention other issues.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Director Chen's bewildered expression garnered a unanimous [hahahahaha] from the comments.
 

 
In that moment, the director deeply understood one thing—
 

 
Don’t play games with Tong Zhao; just speak directly and clearly.
 

 
After sweating profusely during the off-road challenge and even swimming in the pool, the production team gave everyone an hour to freshen up and rest before gathering in the shooting studio. This film studio had space for fifty holographic filming booths and was adjacent to a villa-style dormitory resembling a resort. As a special guest, Duan Ge enjoyed certain privileges, having an entire small villa to herself, complete with a garden enclosed by a grassy wall and an outdoor bathtub. Considering her status as a female star, she only took a shower indoors.
 

 
Other contestants were relaxing in a Zen-like manner while waiting for the shoot to start.
 

 
Some hurriedly sought advice from colleagues who had experience in urban survival variety shows, trying to adjust their mindset in the limited time.
 

 
There were also a few individuals who weren’t even considered variety stars; they were merely lucky enough to be selected for a chance to earn some appearance fees, dreaming of winning the prize money. They eagerly searched for a chance to get autographs and photos with female celebrities.
 

 
However, they couldn't find anyone.
 

 
They didn’t see anyone in the rest area, nor were they able to gather with the director, and the villa door displaying Duan Ge’s name indicated that the owner was temporarily unavailable.
 

 
Where could she have gone?
 

 
In the end, a clever contestant pulled out their phone to check the live stream of “One Life Survivor,” clicking on the camera that followed Tong Zhao throughout—
 

 
They had searched all the recreational facilities but had overlooked the gym inside the shooting studio.
 

 
Meanwhile, Duan Ge was running on a treadmill at a steady pace.
 

 
A flying camera hovered to her right.
 

 
Under the camera, Duan Ge slightly tilted her face up, and a droplet of sweat slid from her tight jawline down to her collarbone. The gym lights illuminated her, making her skin appear dazzlingly white. Perhaps because she wanted to focus on exercising, she wore very light makeup, which highlighted the striking features that seemed sculpted by divine design—her high nose bridge and full lips formed an impeccable profile, resembling a beautiful girl straight out of an anime.
 

 
Damn.
 

 
So beautiful.
 

 
Several male contestants watching the live stream couldn't help but start imagining—
 

 
If Tong Zhao accidentally fell into their hands during the survival show, would they dare to eliminate her?
 

 
They were thankful that the intelligent AI would block and suppress any inappropriate thoughts; otherwise, they were genuinely concerned about losing control.
 

 
[Zhao Zhao is really working hard, completely different from her role in "Emperor Ming."]
 

 
[The scariest part is that such a naturally beautiful woman is working so hard… Just finished a tiring challenge, took a shower, and now exercising. Does her stamina never run out?]
 

 
[So now are they trying to set up Tong Zhao as a strong sportswoman?]
 

 
[Huh? Is this really considered a character setup?]
 

 
The comments almost erupted again.
 

 
They didn’t because the time was up, and all the contestants gathered in the shooting studio.
 

 
Everyone lay down in the holographic shooting pods.
 

 
Duan Ge closed her eyes, waiting for the equipment to activate, and heard a faint child’s voice in her mind:
 

 
[Big sister Duan Ge, you seem really irritable lately. Are you unhappy?]
 

 
The chances for Zhao Zai to emerge were very rare.
 

 
Since it had been so long, this personality was buried deep within, and it was only during the last check of her consciousness palace that Zhao Zai had awakened.
 

 
[It's a bit,]
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t want to scare her little self and explained actively: [Every world setting and life experience in the quick-traveling has been exaggerated—like Sister Lu almost losing her life due to betrayal by her husband, I inevitably ended up with blood on my hands in the apocalypse, and Xiao Chen developed an odd personality in the palace… Each of us has obvious character flaws, and I’m just a bit restless in peaceful times. Sorry about that.]
 

 
Zhao Zai was puzzled: [Why does sister need to apologize to me?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Not becoming a perfect adult, I feel quite sorry for my childhood self.]
 

 
At this moment, the equipment activated, and a strong wave of uncontrollable drowsiness swept over her, pulling her into the depths of consciousness...
 

 
Zhao Zai still wanted to say something, but Duan Ge could no longer hear.
 

 
...
 

 
When she regained consciousness, all the contestants were initially in an uncontrollable state, with a full minute to absorb the introduced plot background.
 

 
In "One Life Survivor," the contestants retained their original memories.
 

 
Only the memories related to the survival variety show would be temporarily blocked, replaced by a new unified storyline.
 

 
[This is Ganan City, an empty city.]
 

 
[It was once the city you were most familiar with. You lived here, trading your labor or knowledge for meager rewards. A war has transformed Ganan City beyond recognition; every shadow could hide danger or opportunity.]
 

 
From a bird's-eye view, the aerial shots captured the entire concrete jungle.
 

 
If it weren't for the signs of destruction scattered throughout the high-rise buildings, it would remind one of a promotional video for a first-tier city.
 

 
[Before the withdrawal of your country’s army, three supply points were left in Ganan City.]
 

 
[Compared to the unpredictable airdrop resource packages that could land on your head or in front of the enemy, these three supply points offer you fair competition.]
 

 
A low, soft male voice emphasized "fair competition."
 

 
On the live broadcast, the map of Ganan City slowly unfolded, with the locations of the three supply points highlighted in bright yellow circles. Next, fifteen equally long routes in different colors were shown—this ensured that the "spawn points" for the five four-member teams were at equal distances from each supply point, making it a "fair competition."
 

 
This information was marked as "For Audience Only" on the live stream, and the contestants were unaware.
 

 
Some contestants might notice this detail and deduce their opponents' approximate positions.
 

 
For those who couldn't figure it out, they would just have to guess.
 

 
[Ganan City has no other living people. Your goal, as a group of twenty, is to survive for fifteen days. To stay alive, you must search for limited resources in this wasteland and learn to hide yourself in danger...]
 

 
[Due to periodic gas attacks from the enemy, the area available for safe activities will keep shrinking. Try to find enough supplies while you still have the chance to explore!]
 

 
[Alternatively, stealing from other teams is also a good option.]
 

 
[You five teams come from five different countries, and the seeds of suspicion and conflict have long been planted in your hearts. Do you really have enough trust to collaborate and achieve a win-win situation across language barriers?]
 

 
The "Language Barrier" option lit up on the live stream.
 

 
All the guests were from China, and this was a difficulty setting to prevent full cooperation among them.
 

 
[---Just try your best!]
 

 
[You are respectively the Cloud Team, Sun Team, Star Team, Moon Team, and Thunder Team.]
 

 
As the deliberately slowed narration played, the live stream switched between different teams. Since the storyline hadn’t fully been introduced, they were still unable to control their bodies, forced into a half-awake sleep as the plot unfolded.
 

 
It was like an unskippable opening CG.
 

 
[Friendly reminder: Enemy assassins are wandering in Ganan City, searching for their prey.]
 

 
[You can attempt to kill or capture her, and both will yield generous rewards.]
 

 
While all the contestants were asleep, the camera shifted.
 

 
It landed on a gray concrete floor, where a pair of pure black military boots walked steadily.
 

 
The footsteps were light.
 

 
The camera slowly panned up, revealing a section of a fair leg, followed by a woman dressed in tight black gear.
 


She walked outside, and the rising sun broke through the clouds, unveiling the entirety of Ganan City, casting light on her face and outlining her cold, beautiful features—
 

 
The special guest of "One Life Survivor," Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Only when you kill, capture, or are killed by her... ]
 

 
[Will you know the name of this assassin.]
 

 
[Hiss—]
 

 
[The temporary change in the map's storyline setup is really exciting! Tong Zhao is so cool QAQ]
 

 
[Assassin!]
 

 
[Shall I call out the name of the Assassin?]
 

 
[The previous Assassin was referring to the killer.]
 

 
Duan Ge woke up particularly early.
 

 
Unlike the other guests who slept until the opening CG finished, she had been wandering around for a while.
 

 
The storyline she received was different due to her "faction," and much shorter than that of the other contestants—
 

 
[You are an imperial assassin.]
 

 
[Your mission is to identify the living hidden in this city and eliminate them all.]
 

 
[This is not a simple task, as you will be facing twenty opponents.]
 

 
[Your superiors expect you to die on this mission and have not provided you with any weapons or resources; you must provide proof of your kills to exchange for survival resources.]
 

 
In her mind, a special watch appeared, the kind worn by the other contestants.
 

 
[You don’t want to die.]
 

 
[If you want to survive, you must hunt down these twenty survivors.]
 

 
[Your codename is—]
 

 
[Hunter.]
 

 
As the deep, powerful male voice finished the last English syllable, Duan Ge tilted her head back, her dark eyes seemingly locking onto those of the audience watching the live stream. The background noise faded into a whisper, leaving only her cold gaze and vibrant lips.
 

 
[...If ABO really existed, Tong Zhao would undoubtedly be an Alpha.]
 

 
[I’m crazy! Too Alpha! I used to think I was straight until I met Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Target! Aim! Shoot!]
 

 
In the large crowd of Tong Zhao's female fans, they excitedly discussed the live stream content, relieved that their sister didn’t adopt the same values as the male viewers; otherwise, they wouldn’t have witnessed her cold and cool side! Of course, the sweet and charming Tong Zhao had once captivated them at first glance, but the Tong Zhao in "One Life Survivor" made the fans want to marry her!
 

 
They wanted to be taken out by the assassin sister!
 

 
…
 

 
The assassin sister wore a displeased expression.
 

 
She had every reason to be unhappy.
 

 
Her unscrupulous superior was pushing her toward a deadly mission, which was why she was given such a challenging task.
 

 
To ensure the show began with excitement, the production team cruelly set Tong Zhao's initial hunger level to thirty, equivalent to waking up after ten hours of sleep and having just one dry piece of bread.
 

 
Meanwhile, everyone else started with an eighty hunger level.
 

 
This was to urge her to quickly hunt down the other contestants.
 

 
Duan Ge found herself on the top floor of a building disguised as a ruin, where she could send signals to headquarters for resource exchanges via a special watch—her base as a hunter and her sleeping place—
 

 
which was just a simple nylon bed.
 

 
It was identical to the one in Tong Zhao's consciousness palace, likely a gag by the production team.
 

 
"So annoying..."
 

 
Duan Ge clasped her hands and moved her joints.
 

 
The intelligent AI did not broadcast her inner thoughts, leaving the audience to guess.
 

 
At the same time, the members of the five teams gradually woke up.
 

 
After receiving the background setting, their reactions varied. Some first-time participants were overwhelmed by the dire situation and burst into tears while holding onto their teammates.
 

 
"I want to go home..."
 

 
"Can we really survive for fifteen days? There’s no food, and we can’t even hide to get through this."
 

 
A short-haired man, about 1.8 meters tall, cried on his teammate's shoulder.
 

 
People are easily influenced by the atmosphere; listening to his muffled sobs, the remaining three teammates felt the pressure and couldn’t find comforting words to say, only managing to awkwardly say, "Stop crying, it won’t help."
 

 
This only made him more distraught.
 

 
[While it's human nature, given the circumstances, why do I feel like laughing?]
 

 
[Laughing 1, I hope some narrow-minded elementary students realize that vulnerability isn’t exclusive to women; stereotypes that discriminate against women also oppress men.]
 

 
[If I were in their shoes, not knowing it’s a variety show, I would definitely be scared...]
 

 
In the live broadcast, the other four teams had cautiously begun to explore. Everyone recognized the importance of the supply points, and with three supply points to be divided among five teams, conflicts were highly likely. The best strategy was to reach one first and secure the resources.
 

 
Only the team with the emotionally broken member stood still, each person looking troubled. The contestants only had vague information about the supply points.
 

 
They didn't know the exact locations of the supplies.
 

 
For example, Point A was marked as the McDonald's at 280 Qilisi Avenue, but it was a larger McDonald's. Where exactly inside the store were the supplies kept? That would require the contestants to go in and search for themselves.
 

 
Once found, they had to transport the supplies quickly.
 

 
Otherwise, they risked being outpaced by others or getting into a conflict that would leave both parties worse off.
 

 
At this moment, two groups were approaching the McDonald's at Point A, one right after the other.
 

 
The two teams had about a five-minute time difference.
 

 
The first team to arrive successfully entered the McDonald's. Upon entering, they immediately noticed that the kitchen was devoid of any food, and even the straws and tissue boxes that were supposed to be available in unlimited quantities were empty. After confirming that the inside was relatively safe, the leader signaled for his teammates to come in—he remained vigilant, indicating that they should pay attention to the other door in case other teams entered, so they wouldn’t get trapped inside and forced into a conflict.
 

 
As two of them entered the kitchen, one stayed outside to keep watch.
 

 
“Captain!”
 

 
He Su excitedly called the captain over when he discovered a box in the storage room, eager to take credit.
 

 
Since all useful supplies in the store were gone, he instinctively thought he had found a supply pack. Just as the captain came over, delighted, he heard a strange noise: “Wait, there’s something odd inside.”
 

 
Tick-tock... tick-tock...
 

 
A faint, strange sound that could only be detected by careful listening.
 

 
There was a broom by the door, and the captain held the broomstick, slowly prying open the box.
 

 
At the moment the stick lifted the lid, a spark ignited—
 

 
Boom!
 

 
The two of them instinctively fell back, only to be hit by a noxious chemical smell.
 

 
Fortunately, the explosion's force was minor, and since they had anticipated it, they managed to retreat in time. Aside from being covered in smoke and their hearts racing, they suffered no injuries.
 

 
But if someone had been right next to the box when it exploded or had opened it barehanded, they might have lost an arm or worse.
 

 
“If I had just opened the box directly...”
 

 
The terrifying image flashed through He Su's mind, leaving him shaken.
 

 
“Every dark corner may hide danger or opportunity,” the captain repeated the words left by their reinforcements.
 

 
In Ganan City, there were dangers left behind by the enemy, which could be a small “surprise” or an unreasonable landmine.
 

 
To navigate this city in search of survival, without extraordinary luck, one had to be extremely cautious!
 

 
“What happened?”
 

 
The earlier explosion had attracted the attention of other teammates. A young boy, Chen Xiangtai, peeked in and said, “I found a cardboard box under the cash register in the dining area. Captain, come check if it's what we’re looking for!”
 

 
The captain quickly and concisely briefed Chen Xiangtai on what had just happened and acknowledged his caution: “Well done. We need to move quickly; that explosion was loud, and it’s possible others heard it.”
 

 
This time, they had successfully found a supply box filled with food and drinking water.
 

 
Another team would arrive in two minutes.
 

 
Fortunately, they hadn’t heard any noise from the kitchen.
 

 
Only a pair of eyes, which had captivated countless souls, stood at a high vantage point observing the activity on the street.
 

 
“Ah, I see food!”
 

 
Duan Ge's gaze fell on the second team rushing toward point A.
# Chapter68
The once globally popular reality show "One Life Survivor" focused on the conflicts between humans and nature, as well as the tensions among people. To emphasize the former, the filming locations were set on resource-scarce islands (the production team intentionally chose places without easily accessible natural resources). To stimulate the latter, an elimination system was established.
 

 
Many subsequent survival-themed shows originated from this concept.
 

 
To enhance viewer engagement, the production team preferred contestants of equal strength rather than a solo act dominating the stage, which is why they invited Tong Zhao to play the role of the hunter—part of the consideration was to "balance the power."
 

 
While all the other contestants had yet to obtain weapons, the hunter already had a crossbow. If given to a burly man with relevant experience, he might eliminate an entire team by himself. Giving it to a fit female celebrity, however, was seen as more balanced.
 

 
The entire production team was quite pleased with this arrangement.
 

 
At that moment, Duan Ge, who had just discovered the whereabouts of the other contestants, was descending.
 

 
—And she was really going down.
 

 
Repeated explosions had left many buildings in Ganan City in disrepair, with frequent missing tiles on the east side or gaping holes on the west, and entire ceilings blown away. Duan Ge climbed down the fire escape, the wind tousling her short hair, as she hummed "Hotel California" leisurely.
 

 
Viewers watching this scene momentarily felt as though they were watching an action blockbuster.
 

 
She had originally had long hair.
 

 
However, after pondering for a while, she couldn't figure out why she, as an assassin, had grown long hair in the first place. Even if tied back into a manageable ponytail, it could easily become a noticeable weakness in close combat, where being grabbed by the hair would be quite troublesome.
 

 
Without hesitation, Duan Ge took a small knife and cut her hair to a neck-length bob.
 

 
This action left her fans feeling a chill.
 

 
Soon after, they noticed that Tong Zhao had a small face, and her short hairstyle accentuated her delicate features, making their hearts warm again.
 

 
Even with a messy haircut, the beautiful sister looked good—especially with her stylish short hair!
 

 
Assassins never take the main roads.
 

 
Similarly, Duan Ge preferred not to walk the main path.
 

 
Her aversion stemmed from her experiences in the apocalypse, where countless eyes lurked in the shadows. Walking the main road was just asking to be ambushed. Thus, viewers watched as she effortlessly navigated between buildings in a straight line, like a wildcat roaming the city, unconcerned with human-made paths—why should a little cat adhere to human social rules?
 

 
If this segment of Duan Ge’s actions were cut out, it would make a delightful parkour short video.
 

 
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
 

 
Duan Ge landed on a rooftop, bending slightly before leaping to a lower terrace.
 

 
From a bird’s-eye view, the height between the buildings looked perilous, a misstep could mean fatal consequences.
 

 
Traditional viewers were fine, but the immersive experience of holographic viewing had many feeling weak in the knees.
 

 
Duan Ge’s movements were decisive, showing no hesitation.
 

 
The camera maintained a distance that was neither too close nor too far, allowing the audience to see her expressionless, cool profile, with only her breathing slightly quickening.
 

 
A special alert from the production team read: “Dangerous actions, please do not attempt.”
 

 
[Wow, my legs are shaking!!!]
 

 
[What’s so impressive about this? I did it all the time before I broke my leg.]
 

 
[Thinking about it, if she falls, it’s not just a broken leg that’s at stake.]
 

 
The audience's first reaction was that the official had given her cheat codes.
 

 
"One Life Survivor" is a relatively credible variety show.
 

 
Regardless of whether it's the template or the storyline, everything is published on the official website—like in a cop drama, where the lead gets the [shooting] skill, it’s not just a simple line of text saying they’ve acquired it; multiple lines of code must be integrated into the lead's subconscious.
 

 
Even if a skill is mastered, based on personal style, the lead might not use a gun as their primary weapon.
 

 
Just like someone who has never used a gun may instinctively grab the nearest item—a folding chair—when confronted with conflict; it’s a matter of thought patterns, it’s subconscious.
 

 
Astute variety show fans checked the official website and found that there were no related skills assigned to Tong Zhao.
 

 
This proved that her walking habits were genuine.
 

 
She doesn’t take the usual path.
 

 
[So, can some fans chime in? Does your sister in real life also dislike walking properly? /doge]
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans were just as perplexed.
 

 
Despite watching countless interviews and keeping up with her on social media, thinking they understood her well...
 

 
Every time Tong Zhao appeared, there was always something new to discover!
 

 
[If I had to describe Tong Zhao with a food, I’d say she’s a lasagna.]
 

 
[You only see the second layer; you think she’s the first layer, but she’s actually on the fifth!]
 

 
[So hard to see through her!]
 

 
Climbing the fire escape on the outside of a skyscraper might be bold for a normal person, but she effortlessly slid down the vertical pipes attached to the wall, with no footholds in sight.
 

 
Duan Ge's parkour route was not just impressive; she significantly shortened the time it took to get from Point A to Point B. In the blink of an eye, she landed in the alley behind the McDonald's kitchen. She approached the door quietly and overheard two teams inside.
 

 
[Wow x100]
 

 
[This place looks a bit dilapidated; it probably can't support an adult's weight... Anyway, don’t try this; we don’t know any tricks.]
 

 
[Maybe they climbed down when no one was watching the pipe.]
 

 
[That makes sense.]
 

 
A minute earlier, a member of the Sun Team, on lookout duty, heard the approaching footsteps and immediately interrupted his teammate's excitement over finding supplies, urging them to leave through the second door quickly.
 

 
The McDonald's had three doors.
 

 
Two faced the customers and led to the dining area.
 

 
The last one was in the back kitchen, facing the alley.
 

 
“Someone's coming!”
 

 
“Quick, go!”
 

 
“Damn, someone got here first!”
 

 
The captain of the later-arriving Cloud Team hesitated for a moment. Although he couldn’t understand what the Sun Team was saying, he sensed their anxiousness from their expressions—this meant they were also afraid of conflict!
 

 
In this instant, he quickly called his teammates to advance and fight for the supplies.
 

 
Duan Ge stood at the back door and listened for a moment.
 

 
The smart AI scanned her thoughts:
 

 
[Once again, I can’t understand their chatter.]
 

 
[Hmm, seven guys and one girl.]
 

 
According to the variety show’s settings, as the "hunter," she also couldn't understand the other contestants' languages. However, she could categorize each voice based on subtle differences, immediately visualizing the specific number and gender of the speakers in her mind.
 

 
Upon seeing this, the variety show fans became excited, eagerly anticipating a fight with one celebrity taking on eight.
 

 
However, the next moment, Duan Ge decisively made a choice: “Hmm, there are too many people to take on, I’ll wait a bit.”
 

 
...?
 

 
Wait, does your dictionary really have the words "too many to handle"?
 

 
Perhaps Tong Zhao's earlier unexpected moves had raised the audience's expectations to a Super Saiyan level. Now, seeing her practical mindset made the audience both amused and understanding—yes, she wasn't Superman, nor a berserker charging into the crowd; she was a nimble and perceptive assassin.
 

 
The production team noticed this change and couldn't help but admire how intuitive Tong Zhao's subconscious was.
 

 
If she maintained a perfect persona all the time, completing missions would just be satisfactory, not stunning.
 

 
Unintentionally, she showcased the strategy of building up before revealing strength…
 

 
Director Chen commented, “Her subconscious really brings a sense of drama, it’s amazing.”
 

 
In reality, the director was overthinking it.
 

 
Duan Ge was just a practical person; as long as they could scan her thoughts, they’d realize she was particularly "calculative," skilled at finding the optimal solution in chaotic situations.
 

 
The Sun Team's hesitation had its reasons. Among the four, there was a female doctor who probably thought she couldn’t take on four big men. Unexpectedly, the female doctor of the Sun Team quickly grabbed a chair and smashed it onto the attackers' knees. The force from their close encounter startled the opponents.
 

 
Inside the McDonald's, a fierce battle was underway.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded repeatedly, leaving the audience wondering what she was up to.
 

 
Is she catching the rhythm now?
 

 
The AI promptly scanned her thoughts:
 

 
【A horse stance forward, throw a left hook, then a right hook… quickly use the nunchaku, hum hum ha!】
 

 
……
 

 
She was still humming.
 

 
Due to the reality of not being discovered, she was quietly humming in her mind, still to Jay Chou's "Nunchaku," skipping over the parts she forgot.
 

 
Having just "woken up" in the variety show, everyone was still getting into the groove. The members of the Cloud Team were startled by the fierce display from the female doctor, and in a moment of distraction, the opposing team managed to escape. Hearing that one side had fled, Duan Ge slipped into the kitchen.
 

 
At this moment, the entire Cloud Team's attention was focused on the direction the Sun Team had fled, unaware of the pair of eyes watching them from the kitchen.
 

 
Duan Ge: 【Four of them...】
 

 
Duan Ge: 【I can probably handle this.】
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[I take back what I said about her being a normal person!]
 

 
[No, what do you mean "probably handle"? Sister Zhao, wait, let’s talk this through!/panic/panic]
 

 
Duan Ge readied her crossbow:
 

 
Duan Ge thought clearly: 【My lousy boss only left me two arrows, damn it.】
 

 
She knew that her ranged weapon was meant to weaken the strongest member of the opposing team, who would be a difficult opponent in close combat—undoubtedly the Cloud Team's captain, a tall man nearly six feet tall with a background in sports.
 

 
As she readied her crossbow, the audience held their breath.
 

 
Could she hit her target?
 

 
Keep in mind, her boss not only left her with just two arrows but also didn't give her any shooting skills.
 

 
Soon, the answer was revealed!
 

 
The moment she pulled the trigger, although it didn’t produce a terrifyingly loud bang like a gun, the ensuing gasp confirmed its power—the captain, about to exit McDonald's, howled as he slumped against the wall, collapsing to the ground: “What the fuck? I got hit?!” He touched his wound in disbelief: “An arrow???”
 

 
In "One Life Survivor," pain perception is significantly reduced.
 

 
All contestants accepted this setup without feeling it was unusual.
 

 
However, sustaining multiple injuries would still decrease their mobility.
 

 
Even if the Cloud Team's captain managed to stand up, he would lose combat effectiveness for a while…
 

 
The unexpected attack, combined with the leader's injury, threw the remaining three into chaos. Duan Ge knew this was her fleeting advantage; she had to take out all four of them before they could react. She vaulted over the counter, landed on a table, and with a powerful push, jumped onto one of their shoulders, using her thigh to exert force. Within seconds, the first person was knocked out.
 

 
How to defeat the strong with the weak, to fight solo against many?
 

 
If Duan Ge were to explain, she would say that combat skill is the most important.
 

 
Why can a small, frail assailant kill a tall, strong man? It’s about catching them off guard. Most ordinary people are law-abiding citizens who freeze in fear when faced with evil, becoming even weaker when injured, panicking and only knowing to throw wild punches when fighting back.
 

 
Of course, brawls among ordinary citizens are on the same level.
 

 
But Duan Ge is not ordinary.
 

 
Her combat skills have long been ingrained in her bones through countless skirmishes and ambushes.
 

 
Even her mind sees it as trivial, hardly producing any adrenaline.
 

 
Ordinary people struggle psychologically before life-and-death fights, hesitating over whether they might kill someone… Predators are always in the minority; humans are social creatures, and killing is undoubtedly an act of alienation, a behavior that exiles one from the community. Duan Ge has long been accustomed to the process of humans turning into beasts, and she doesn’t need to wrestle with that.
 

 
If you don’t want to kill, then you shouldn’t draw your weapon in the first place.
 

 
The resolve to put someone to death is the sharpest blade in Duan Ge's hand.
 

 
If life-and-death combat is akin to treasure hunting in water, ordinary people are like beginner swimmers, while Duan Ge is an amphibian; she can calmly and skillfully dive in and find what she seeks—
 

 
The enemy’s vital points.
 

 
The latest episode of "One Life Survivor" features the most popular combat U1, which displays both sides' heart rates, HP values, and fighting spirit levels—when fighting spirit decreases, a person begins to show fear and looks for a chance to escape; when it hits rock bottom, they lose all desire to resist, kneeling down to plead for mercy.
 

 
And in the live broadcast—
 

 
Hunter "Tong Zhao"
 

 
Heart Rate: 140 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 80
 

 
Cloud Team "Shi Sha Tao"
 

 
Heart Rate: 180 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 40
 

 
[Wait, is Tong Zhao’s heart rate during a light jog? Are these two really engaged in the same fight?]
 

 
[You see her looking calm, but her fighting spirit is really high.]
 

 
[How is that determined?]
 

 
Since this is a newly launched system, the audience doesn't understand the principles behind it.
 

 
They might not get it, but they certainly understand the scene where the assassin takes down everyone with a cold face:
 

 
One summary in the comments gets a lot of praise: [Got it, it boils down to four words—steady hands and ruthless.]
 

 
If Duan Ge couldn’t handle eight people, she would instantly become the target of concentrated fire.
 

 
Just like some wild animals won’t attack groups of humans, when the numbers drop to a certain point, they will hesitate no longer, pouncing from the shadows to bite the throat of the straggler, taking them down one by one.
 

 
Everything happened very quickly.
 

 
Without any cinematic slow motion, Duan Ge's speed had the audience furiously typing question marks.
 

 
Good movies don’t have dull moments, and her fight scenes left the audience without even a chance to blink; in the blink of an eye, a big man had fallen. The differences in muscle, height, gender, and age seemed irrelevant before this assassin.
 

 
So fierce that it made the audience's hearts race.
 

 
Yet she was also very beautiful.
 

 
The audience's gaze drifted between her expressive eyes, slightly parted red lips, and the contours of her body.
 

 
Blood splattered onto Duan Ge's cheek.
 

 
She closed her eyes quickly, avoiding any in her eyes, and raised her hand to wipe her face with the back of her hand.
 

 
The captain, who had initially been shot and incapacitated, ended up being the last survivor.
 

 
Cloud Team "Pei Sijie"
 

 
Heart Rate: 177 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 10
 

 
Director Chen switched to Pei Sijie’s perspective, who was sitting on the ground, looking up at Duan Ge with sheer fear on his face.
 

 
Duan Ge stepped through a pool of blood and approached him.
 

 
Her steps were light and graceful, fitting in perfectly even at a gala.
 

 
Pei Sijie was too scared to speak.
 

 
The exemption from pain didn’t make him braver; rather, it diminished the courage needed for a desperate fight to the death. He still believed he could survive, as long as the deadly figure in front of him spared his life.
 

 
Those who rely on their opponents to spare them cannot win.
 

 
[It’s over, it’s over, it’s over…]
 

 
The audience could hear his racing heartbeat.
 

 
Duan Ge, however, had a slight smile, her eyes curving with an expression of delight, as if pleased.
 

 
She nudged Pei Sijie's thigh with the tip of her boot, causing the wound in his side to reopen and let out a small trickle of blood: “Hey, you can move, right?”
 

 
Pei Sijie didn’t understand.
 

 
He covered his wound while begging for mercy and apologizing.
 

 
“Ah, forgot you can’t understand,”
 

 
Duan Ge lost interest instantly.
 

 
[It’s okay, we understand! Zhaozhao, say more QAQ]
 

 
[Want to hear 1]
 

 
“My first arrow was a bit off; I didn’t hit your heart, just your lower back,” Duan Ge lifted her foot, pressing the boot against the arrow’s end, slowly and firmly driving it deeper into his abdomen: “You could stand up, but you didn’t. You watched your teammates die and chose to plead with me… From their attitude towards you, you must be a little leader, right?”
 

 
Duan Ge: [Forget it, it’s boring.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [All dog bosses in the world are the same.]
 

 
Duan Ge had good qualities and didn’t take pleasure in torturing her prey; she ignored the heavy undertones of Pei Sijie’s pleading and gave him a swift end. Then, she removed the watches from the wrists of the four and gathered them.
 

 
After a moment’s thought, she also took any visible jewelry and miscellaneous items from them.
 

 
Duan Ge actually wanted to strip off their clothes.
 

 
However, this fell under restricted behavior. Even though she had no inappropriate subjective intentions, the system would still prevent her from such excessive thoughts to protect the contestants' minimum dignity.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I don’t want to expose my target, which is their watches.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Let’s just leave it at this…]
 

 
Duan Ge: [It would be great if I could blow this place up in one go.]
 

 
The light fell on the assassin’s face, casting a gentle hue.
 

 
Only the audience knew that her mind was filled with anything but gentle and merciless thoughts.
 

 
They had no doubt that as long as she had the materials and conditions allowed, she would indeed blow the entire restaurant to smithereens.
 

 
The audience felt a bit dazed.
 

 
[Duan Ge caught four lone ones by herself?]
 

 
[Oh my, it’s like four soft and crispy players ran into a fully geared assassin and were wiped out in the blink of an eye.]
 

 
[False dangers: landmines and poison gas; true danger: Duan Ge.]
 

 
While the audience was dazed, the production team was losing it.
 

 
Director: “Thick crab…”
 

 
Assistant Director: “Ward?”
 

 
In the filming studio, the four innocent and pitiful contestants woke up in the holographic filming chamber. Pei Sijie looked around in confusion and raised his hand to report: “Director, it seems there’s a problem with the filming chamber; I didn’t enter the survival show.”
 

 
Shi Shatao raised his hand: “Me too.”
 

 
The other two members of the Cloud Team also raised their hands, eager to give feedback.
 

 
However, what they received was a subtle gaze of disappointment mixed with pity from the production staff, leaving them puzzled as they glanced at the clock on the wall—sure enough, it wasn’t long before the equipment had indeed malfunctioned!
 

 
Director Chen waved his hand: “Xiao Wu, go talk to them and find out what happened.”
 

 
Was there even half an hour since the start?
 

 
Editing it down, there might only be fifteen minutes of content?
 

 
… No, we can focus on giving more shots to Tong Zhao to extend the time, making the sacrifice of these four contestants seem less pointless. Director Chen exchanged glances with others, and they all saw the shared pain in each other's eyes.
 

 
There are twenty contestants, and with Tong Zhao, that makes twenty-one.
 

 
Starting off by losing four—how are we supposed to film this?
 

 
And looking at Tong Zhao's subconscious…
 

 
Fewer than five people are seen by her as easy targets.
 

 
According to the show's setting, teams cannot communicate or cooperate…
 

 
To prevent teams from banding together for peaceful coexistence, the production team had unintentionally turned into Tong Zhao's slaughterhouse.
 

 
“This episode's audience retention rate has hit a new high!” an excited staff member exclaimed.
 

 
Director Chen shook his head, pointing out the problem: “Don't be shortsighted: the high retention is because Tong Zhao made a big move, raising the audience's expectations significantly—think about it, if you were the audience, wouldn't you be curious about how this survival show can continue after losing one-fifth of its contestants in less than half an hour?”
 

 
The staff nodded honestly.
 

 
“That’s exactly it,” Director Chen held his head in despair: “I want to know how to continue filming too!”
 

 
The worst situation for a survival show is when everyone is ordinary, just waiting to die at the starting point.
 

 
The second worst is a series of solo acts.
 

 
The audience would get bored quickly, leading to a severe imbalance.
 

 
A meticulously prepared survival variety show turning into someone's personal showcase is something the director absolutely does not want.
 

 
The assistant director suggested, “What if we throw in four more people?”
 

 
“That would just seem like cheating…”
 

 
The director shook his head again, pondering: “How about this—let's remove the language barrier between the teams and see if the remaining teams can find a way to work together against the hunter.”
 

 
Staff member: “Chen, wouldn’t that also be cheating?”
 

 
Director Chen: “This is just a desperate measure.”
 

 
After some thought, everyone realized there was no better solution and agreed to change the rules as the director suggested.
 

 
Thus, the audience in the live stream saw a special effects announcement in the chat—
 

 
Temporary Announcement
 

 
“Except for the Cloud Team, the other teams are all citizens of the same country and can communicate freely. [Crying face emoji]”
 

 
The audience slowly began to flood the chat with question marks.
 

 
[Don't ask, just know that Tong Zhao is too awesome.]
 

 
[Can anyone explain what's going on?]
 

 
[The production team definitely didn’t expect Tong Zhao to be a walking cheat code. They initially had the language barrier for balance but realized they miscalculated and quickly patched it to stabilize the situation; otherwise, they couldn't continue filming.]
 

 
After a fan explained, even some viewers who usually don’t watch survival shows began to understand.
 

 
Tong Zhao, a woman who made the production team change the rules!
 

 
And this woman, upon returning to base, tentatively used a watch to trade for promised resources from her superiors…
 

 
She received a gun, which contained only one bullet.
 

 
And three packs of Master Kong instant noodles.
 

 
The instant noodle packaging had three stickers on it, labeled "Breakfast," "Lunch," and "Dinner."
 

 
Duan Ge: "..."
 

 
In that moment, the cold and stylish imperial assassin turned into a worker exploited by her boss.
# Chapter69
Angry as she was, she still had to eat.
 

 
After all, she was too hungry.
 

 
The imperial assassin could only bow down to instant noodles.
 

 
Duan Ge ripped open the packaging.
 

 
When she looked inside and didn't find the seasoning packet, the cold, beautiful face wavered again. Her pale hand crushed the noodle block through the packaging. Watching the unlucky assassin struggle, the audience couldn't help but burst into laughter.
 

 
["Tong Zhao is just too, too cute!"]
 

 
["An assassin who's working while eating plain instant noodles without the seasoning packet feels so painfully real… I can't believe I'm feeling the hardship of being an overworked employee in a survival show. After finishing a tough day of overtime and wanting a good meal, but the takeout you ordered turns out awful—it's enough to break your spirit."]
 

 
["Production team, have a heart! I know you're reading the comments, give my girl a decent meal!"]
 

 
The third comment was upvoted to high visibility and bolded.
 

 
But it was no use—the production team knew this would hit the audience’s soft spot.
 

 
Is a particular contestant especially capable and popular with the viewers?
 

 
Great! Make things harder for them! The audience will keep complaining but still watch.
 

 
Since there was no electricity at the ruins and no hot water at the base, Duan Ge bit directly into the crunchy noodles, gnawing them as if she was chewing on the skull of her annoying boss. After finishing the whole block, her hunger level rose to 50, which left her in an awkward spot of "barely not hungry, but definitely not full."
 

 
With Duan Ge's level of activity, she wouldn't gain weight even on a feast of meat.
 

 
She needed more calories!
 

 
Eating three packs of instant noodles a day, and dry at that—if the survivor doesn't die first, she'll want to.
 

 
Duan Ge jumped twice on the spot to vent her frustration.
 

 
Her legs were long and straight. Not long ago, she had used those beautiful legs to press against an enemy's carotid artery, causing them to pass out from lack of oxygen. Her whole body was a lethal weapon, but when she wasn't fighting or showing off her skills, the audience found her adorable—
 

 
["Those two little jumps make her look like a bunny!"]
 

 
A cold comment from a passerby: ["That bunny could kick your head clean off."]
 

 
["Stop, I can picture it now."]
 

 
Duan Ge pursed her lips, realizing they were a bit dry.
 

 
Dry noodles are dry enough, but with no water in her supplies, it was practically the definition of "extra dry." Thinking about it carefully, how could there be no water in the supplies—weren't they deliberately making things difficult? Clean drinking water is a critical survival resource.
 

 
As for the survivors in the city, Duan Ge knew little: there were twenty people in total, but the gender and age ratio was unclear. Judging from the recent conflict between two teams, it seemed the survivors weren't in the United States, which worked to her advantage.
 

 
Duan Ge: "If none of them are alone, even I'd find it troublesome."
 

 
["Now that's more like an assassin."]
 

 
["As long as I kill all the witnesses, it's a successful stealth mission!"]
 

 
The audience nodded in agreement.
 

 
Duan Ge: "But there are advantages to groups gathering, too."
 

 
Duan Ge: "I'll need to find a way to get some explosives, just in case..."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Sigh, that kind of stuff should've been prepared by my boss. I'm not really good at handling that."
 

 
["Huh?"]
 

 
["Okay, explosions are art. Anything can be assassin gear!"]
 

 
["Traditional assassin equipment: black clothes and a grappling hook; modern assassin equipment: explosives."]
 

 
In the variety show, the “annoying boss,” who in reality was the production team, subtly added a special effects subtitle: “If we prepare anything more for you, the show would end in a day,” accompanied by a trembling, cartoonish dog emoji. It was a precise attempt to be cute without being annoying, turning their rule-changing "desperate move" into something more palatable. After all, everyone knew Tong Zhao wasn’t in it for the prize money; the production team clearly wanted the show to be entertaining. Making small rule adjustments was understandable.
 

 
The audience was thoroughly amused.
 

 
Where was the supposed apocalyptic atmosphere?
 

 
Where was the brutal combat in the ruins?
 

 
Even though they understood, they were still eagerly waiting for Tong Zhao to dominate her opponents!
 

 
This series of cheeky maneuvers indirectly proved that Tong Zhao wasn’t colluding with the production team. But, if there was any shady business going on, it wasn’t about favoring Tong Zhao. Instead, it seemed more like the opposite—making things harder for her.
 

 
...
 

 
Duan Ge casually stuffed the remaining unredeemed watches under her pillow.
 

 
Wasn’t she redeeming them all to see if there might be other useful items?
 

 
Just as the audience began to wonder, the AI revealed her inner thoughts and cleared up the confusion:
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’m saving up for a ten-pull before redeeming.”
 

 
["Ten-pull, hahaha!"]
 

 
["Come on, production team, at least guarantee an SR self-heating hotpot with the ten-pull!"]
 

 
["Look at how they’ve pushed the imperial assassin!"]
 

 
Director Chen didn’t expect Tong Zhao’s subconscious to take her acting skills to a new level—she was like a walking meme machine. He quickly instructed the effects team to create a prize wheel, which would be used the next time Tong Zhao came to redeem her items. They also came up with a small event: the top ten viewers on the gift leaderboard, all wearing Tong Zhao fan badges, would participate in a prize draw. Whatever the fan won, Tong Zhao would receive in the survival show.
 

 
If those ten fans were willing, they could even fill out their address in the background, and the production team would send them a real-life version of the item their idol received.
 

 
If the fan was super lucky, their idol might just end up with a self-heating hotpot, freshly coded by the modeling team working overtime!
 

 
If the fan drawing the prize for their idol has bad luck, well, sorry—your idol will just have to keep eating instant noodles without a seasoning packet...
 

 
Tong Zhao's fan clubs, a few unofficial support groups, immediately got anxious, determined to make sure she got a decent meal. Five members in the top ten leaderboard were wealthy patrons from her fan club. These rich fans certainly had money, but since they usually just spent directly on mobile games, they had no idea if they were lucky or not. So, they started asking other fans with better luck to draw for them in the support group.
 

 
In real life, the “lucky” and “unlucky” fans were teaming up to ensure Zhao Zhao could finally enjoy a hotpot feast.
 

 
In the variety show world, the Sun Squad returned to their "spawn point"—a partially destroyed house with half the ceiling blown off, but with three intact walls and a secure front door, which seemed safe enough. They opened a box to check their supplies.
 

 
At the bottom were 24 bottles of 500ml mineral water, stacked neatly. On top of that were various canned foods, and finally, there was a layer of tightly packed, individually wrapped small bread rolls, which bounced out like little white rabbits as soon as the box was opened. Rice was hard to come by, but the bread could be dipped in the canned food—quite a thoughtful arrangement.
 

 
[...]
 

 
["I'm losing it here... Won't Tong Zhao just break down if she sees this?"]
 

 
["The production team has no chill, hahaha!"]
 

 
The team captain pondered for a moment and said, "Everyone's tired. Let’s each have a bread roll, and two people can share a can. Let’s eat something first."
 

 
He Su chose a can of luncheon meat and shared it with the female doctor.
 

 
He tore open the bread roll and stuffed some luncheon meat inside.
 

 
The cold, unheated meat was a bit greasy, but He Su was so hungry that even the grease soaking into the bread became delicious. The four of them silently finished their portions of bread. He Su couldn’t hold back and muttered quietly, “Is this all we get to eat? How are we supposed to last fifteen days? Preparing something better wouldn’t cost much.”
 

 
The female doctor patted him on the shoulder and said, “Be grateful we have anything to eat.”
 

 
He Su, still frustrated, added, “It’s hard to accept that the enemy’s lackeys are feasting while we’re stuck gnawing on bread and cold canned food.”
 

 
Due to the storyline’s faction setup, He Su’s reference to the “enemy’s lackeys” was a direct jab at Tong Zhao.
 

 
["The ‘enemy lackey’ is over there gnawing on plain instant noodles, so let’s not bring her into this."]
 

 
["Good thing Tong Zhao doesn’t speak their language, or would she be furious hearing this?"]
 

 
["Now I want to see an angry bunny!"]
 

 
It’s unclear who started it, but somehow, Tong Zhao had been nicknamed "bunny" by the audience.
 

 
There was no hidden food stash in the house—no safe, no basement. After some discussion, the Sun Squad decided to hide half of their supplies deep under the bed and cover them with miscellaneous items. Canaan City was a tiny, remote place, and the chances of running into one of the twenty survivors were slim, let alone having their base discovered. The captain reasoned, “From the outside, this place looks like any other abandoned house. The chances of someone coming in while we’re out and doing a full search are very low. Don’t worry about things that haven’t happened. What are we going to do, stash our food in a bank?”
 

 
The banks in Canaan City had been bombed into ruins. Cash was now as worthless as scrap paper, even less valuable than toilet paper.
 

 
At least toilet paper could be used to wipe your face.
 

 
After the captain finished, the group found his reasoning sound and stopped worrying.
 

 
The conversation then shifted to the conflict that had occurred while searching for supplies.
 

 
He Su said, “Sister Tan was so cool—she threw a chair and scared them all off. They didn’t even bother chasing us afterward.”
 

 
Sister Tan was the female doctor on their team.
 

 
Actually, she had decent stamina. After all, being a doctor requires endurance—without it, one could collapse during surgery. When the young, enthusiastic teammate praised her, she didn’t feel much emotion, but instead voiced her suspicion: “...I noticed that after they recovered and wanted to chase us, we weren’t running very fast. But after a while, there was no noise at all. It’s a bit strange.”
 

 
At the time, they had been so scared, adrenaline was pumping through them. They bolted out the door and ran as fast as they could, avoiding retracing their steps to avoid being followed. Instead, they took several detours before finally returning to their “spawn point,” the residential area in Julong District.
 

 
Thinking back now...
 

 
The captain said, “Yeah, after we reached the end of the street, we couldn’t hear anything anymore.”
 

 
Although he could run much faster, he held back, struggling with himself but ultimately slowing down to stay at the back of the team to protect those who were slower: “From what I remember, as soon as we left the store, they didn’t chase us. I even heard a strange scream.”
 

 
That was the Cloud Team’s captain howling like a wounded pig after being shot with an arrow.
 

 
Sister Tan added, “I heard that too.”
 

 
He Su disagreed, “It sounded more like a roar to me.”
 

 
A roar could make sense too, as a way to boost morale.
 

 
One of the team members quietly suggested, “Should we... go back and take a look?”
 

 
The captain shook his head, fearing an ambush.
 

 
His reasoning was clear: since they had already secured food, it was better to stay holed up until their supplies ran low before taking another risk. “Why look for trouble when you don’t have to? Surviving these fifteen days is the real goal of this game. If we must take a risk, I’ll be the one to go.”
 

 
He patted a teammate on the head. “Don’t overthink it. We don’t know when the enemy might release poison gas. Keep an eye on the alerts on your watch.”
 

 
The poison gas was released at random intervals.
 

 
However, thirty minutes before the gas was released, the watch would display a map of Canaan City along with an official warning, giving any players in the affected area time to escape.
 

 
“If we have to take risks, we might as well check out the other two supply points,” He Su suggested.
 

 
So, what were the conditions at the other two supply points?
 

 
The Thunder Team had exceptional luck. When they arrived at their supply point, they didn’t run into any other teams and successfully gathered food supplies and a small amount of basic medical supplies from a hospital.
 

 
The Star Team and Moon Team evenly split the supplies at an elementary school supply point.
 

 
Although they only got half of what was available, they came away without any injuries.
 

 
From the audience's omniscient perspective, not running into Tong Zhao was a huge stroke of luck.
 

 
This turn of events surprised both the audience and the production team.
 

 
How did they manage to negotiate without speaking the same language?
 

 
AI-scanned thoughts revealed the answer—
 

 
Star Team Captain: "Damn, the other side looks strong. We wouldn’t have the advantage in a fight."
 

 
Moon Team Captain: "Those muscles must’ve come from eating protein powder. If I took a punch, even if I didn’t die, I’d definitely get a concussion."
 

 
After weighing the pros and cons, both sides tentatively used gestures to express minimal friendliness. They then divided the resources equally and backed away slowly while keeping each other in view. They only turned around and left once they had reached a safe distance, ensuring there was no opportunity for a sudden betrayal.
 

 
When every potential human treachery was taken into account, the outcome turned out to be peaceful and civilized.
 

 
The production team was quite pleased with this development.
 

 
“Not bad, starting to feel like a proper survival show.”
 

 
Director Chen finally felt a bit of relief. “This feels right.”
 

 
As the show seemed to be getting on the right track, the staff could relax slightly. As for the contestant who had been eliminated early, well, they just chalked it up to bad luck!
 

 
“By the way, what’s Tong Zhao doing?”
 

 
Just as the words fell, the director switched the main screen to focus on the exploited imperial assassin, Duan Ge.
 

 
After the other contestants had found supplies, they followed human instinct and hid indoors, where they felt safe. Meanwhile, Duan Ge, who was still hungry and thirsty, managed to find the last two bottles of mineral water on a nearby supermarket shelf.
 

 
That's right—there were still a few remaining resources in Jinan City.
 

 
However, they were hard to find, requiring contestants to take the risk of running into other teams or being caught by the assassin while out searching.
 

 
How did Duan Ge just happen to find them in the nearby supermarket?
 

 
Was this a moral awakening or the production team growing a conscience?
 

 
No, it was neither.
 

 
It was because AI had scanned that Duan Ge, who was suffering from thirst and on the verge of losing her temper, had decided to return to the McDonald's nearby, intending to cut open the bodies while they were still fresh to drink blood...
 

 
To avoid airing such a graphic scene, Director Chen had hastily added two sets of mineral water into her path, hoping to calm her down.
 

 
The two bottles of water somewhat appeased Duan Ge.
 

 
She then found a high vantage point to overlook the city.
 

 
While contestants had supply points, hunters like Duan Ge also had special privileges. Her privilege was being able to choose the gas drop location an hour before the toxic gas was released. The range and timing of the gas drop were decided by the production team, but the exact location within Jinan City was up to her.
 

 
Duan Ge took only ten minutes to finalize her plan.
 

 
It wasn’t difficult.
 

 
She would wait near the edge of the gas, waiting for the right target to appear. It was like fishing on the edge of the shrinking zone in PUBG—wait, and you'll catch someone. As the safe area shrank, even if she was unlucky, she had mapped out three main routes on the map. All she had to do was watch from her high perch.
 

 
"They didn't even give me a military-grade binocular…”
 

 
Duan Ge muttered quietly in complaint.
 

 
Those escapees were way too poor—none of them had any useful resources on them.
 

 
[Our girl is the poorest assassin in history!]
 

 
[The production team has no heart.]
 

 
[No, think about it—if they actually gave her a full assassin's kit, the other teams would probably already be wiped out. This show could go straight to casting for the next season = =]
 

 
The audience laughed while agreeing this made sense.
 

 
While Duan Ge in the show struggled with her lack of resources, outside the show, a video of Tong Zhao single-handedly taking down four people was edited by devoted fans and uploaded to Weibo. Her agent, Sister Chu, had been keeping a close eye on things and wasn’t about to miss such a golden opportunity for promotion. She quickly paid for big influencers and some PR pieces to boost the video.
 

 
@VarietyShowReviewsV:
 

 
I have to share this hidden gem of a variety show, “One Life Survivor”! Less than 15 minutes into the episode, and four contestants are already eliminated. Can you guess who the killer is?
 

 
[Video]
 

 
This post hit the target audience perfectly.
 

 
Since the fight scene was so short, the video posted by the marketing account was a combination of two clips: the original and a slow-motion version. In slow motion, you could clearly see how Tong Zhao had taken down four opponents in such a short time. Some people who hadn’t been following the entertainment industry but remembered liking Tong Zhao’s previous work were immediately intrigued:
 

 
[Whoa? Is this a variety show? This clip gives off serious Feng Yanqi vibes.]
 

 
[Mind blown!!! So cool!!!!]
 

 
[Oh please, is this supposed to be impressive? If Tong Zhao fought me, she’d be begging me not to die within five seconds*.]
 

 
[The person above... your mom's dumplings are really delicious.]
 

 
The scene of Tong Zhao taking on four opponents was incredibly entertaining, something rare in Chinese entertainment—at least in variety shows. Once people explained the context behind it in the top comments, the post got even more traction and was shared widely.
 

 
Her agent, Sister Chu, monitored the data feedback and nodded in satisfaction.
 

 
The money spent had brought back substantial returns, which made perfect sense.
 

 
Great content + a well-managed entertainment company = success.
 

 
Everything had progressed logically up to this point.
 

 
However, just as the agent closed the chat to attend to another artist's matters, the assistant she had been in contact with suddenly started messaging frantically again.
 

 
What now?
 

 
Sister Chu, puzzled, opened the chat:
 

 
[Something big happened!!!]
 

 
[Because the fans allowed reposts, that clip got shared on international platforms. A lot of people from overseas are asking who this girl is and whether this is the legendary Chinese martial arts! (Twitter screenshot) The response is huge, even the National Martial Arts Institute posted a Weibo about it… (Weibo screenshot)]
 

 
Just seeing the number of shares on those two screenshots made the agent snap to attention.
 

 
This was basically an example of something becoming a hit abroad and then being re-imported to the domestic market.
 

 
In the West, there's often a preference for Japanese culture when it comes to Asian content—things like “Dragon Ball” are right up their alley.
 

 
China's primary cultural export is martial arts, which remains popular worldwide, thanks to iconic stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, who opened the door for international audiences and left a lasting impression.
 

 
Chinese fight scenes are incredibly captivating!
 

 
Even as traditional cinema fades and action blockbusters dominate, martial arts choreography continues to thrive, with Chinese martial arts films remaining in high demand.
 

 
However, the video of Tong Zhao circulating on international platforms is something different.
 

 
This wasn’t from a movie?
 

 
It was from reality TV?
 

 
Was there an action choreographer involved?
 

 
The person who reposted it kindly answered the curious netizens—no, there was no action choreography; it’s a survival-themed reality show, and the girl’s name is Tong Zhao, a Chinese celebrity!
 

 
The hashtag “#TheGirlWhoFoughtFourOnRealityTV” started gaining moderate attention across North American and European networks. Although Tong Zhao's fighting skills weren’t traditional martial arts—just something she’d honed through rough survival training—it didn’t matter. Her incredibly beautiful East Asian face in front of the camera, combined with the fact that she was Chinese, sealed the deal.
 

 
No problem! It was ‘definitely’ Chinese kung fu!
 

 
Most foreign comments humorously agreed that Chinese kung fu is real.
 

 
Childhood dreams weren’t shattered, and they joked that it would be perfect if a panda appeared as well.
 

 
Chinese students abroad reacted, “Damn, there’s no way we can explain this to foreigners anymore.”
 

 
But despite the confusion, everyone was pretty happy.
 

 
After all, people from every country share a common trait: they love hearing foreigners praise their own people.
 

 
Since it was vaguely related to martial arts, the National Martial Arts Institute jumped on the bandwagon, re-importing the clip to Chinese social media by posting a screenshot from Twitter.
 

 
@NationalMartialArtsInstituteV:
 

 
New-style Chinese Kung Fu! /Laugh and cry/Laugh and cry
 

 
Miss Tong, are you interested in joining our institute?
 

 
This National Martial Arts Institute isn’t like the many fake institutions that use the guise of traditional culture to scam students. Whether in the era of traditional films or the era of instinctive action movies, the top martial arts choreographers and action designers all come from this institute’s masters and students. It is well-known in the film industry, and in recent years, more than 80% of martial arts stars have either graduated from or trained at this institute.
 

 
Their official social media account is not managed by any PR team. In fact, it’s run by the old headmaster himself, who, after learning how to type with one finger, personally posts updates.
 

 
This was basically the grandmaster speaking.
 

 
In the martial arts community, the concept of master and disciple is significant, so naturally:
 

 
- "Are we getting a new junior sister?"
 
- "I really want a junior sister!"
 
- "I just happen to need a female lead for my new film."
 

 
At first glance, these replies seemed like ordinary fan comments...
 

 
But upon closer inspection, they were all verified gold accounts, and all belonged to famous actors, action designers, and directors in the martial arts film industry. Any one of them could provide invaluable resources to newcomers aspiring to enter the world of action films.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, this wasn’t particularly enticing since she was already in a position where she could choose roles at will.
 

 
The problem was the surge in popularity that followed, propelling this short video to the number one spot on trending topics.
 

 
#JuniorSisterTongZhao#
 

 
Manager Chu scrolled through the replies, overwhelmed by the buzz.
 

 
Especially the top comment—director Shi Dingjun, who said he was looking for a female lead for his new film…
 

 
This famous director had just won an international award with his last movie.
 

 
Unlike commercial directors like Shi Qianqiu, who made money from passion projects, Shi Dingjun pursued artistic excellence, particularly in the realm of Chinese martial arts films.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao had piqued his interest?
 

 
Her peers were stunned—who knew that participating in a survival reality show could yield such results!?
# Chapter70
The favor from both the National Martial Arts Academy and Shi Dingjun was like two giant windfalls landing on manager Sister Chu's head. When someone's luck picks up, there's really no stopping it.
 

 
Sister Chu was so pleased that she couldn't contain her smile. She wanted to immediately pull Tong Zhao out of Jinan City and discuss these opportunities with her. Of course, that wasn't possible, so she could only send her a WeChat message. She was sure Tong Zhao would contact her once she emerged from the holographic filming pod.
 

 
With other artists, things might be uncertain, but Tong Zhao always put her at ease.
 

 
...
 

 
At the same time, within the “One Life Survivor” variety show.
 

 
In Jinan City, the captain of the Sun Team, while searching for possible resources in the city, ran into two members of the Thunder Team at a Walmart. As both sides hesitated, unsure whether to part peacefully or start a fight, the Sun Team captain blurted out, “What the hell?” breaking the tension.
 

 
The Thunder Team realized they could communicate!
 

 
When there's a common language, things become less frightening.
 

 
After some long-distance discussion, the two teams reached an agreement.
 

 
What convinced the Sun Team captain, Kong Yeming, was a single statement: “Think about it. Who said we have to be enemies? Why do we have to fight the moment we meet? Our common enemy should be the military, the assassins sent to eliminate us. We should join forces, survive these remaining fourteen days, and wait for the rescue team to pick us up.”
 

 
To show sincerity, the Thunder Team captain handed his weapon (a stick) to his teammate, then walked over to the Sun Team captain with empty hands, extending his right hand.
 

 
Kong Yeming hesitated for a moment but eventually shook the hand that symbolized cooperation.
 

 
Once the decision was made and physical contact occurred, the atmosphere became noticeably more relaxed.
 

 
The Thunder Team captain invited him to join in the search for supplies, and Kong agreed. As he moved to stand between the two Thunder Team members, he finally got a clear look at the "weapon" that had been handed to the teammate earlier—an old, worn-out baguette.
 

 
Kong Yeming: "This?"
 

 
The Thunder Team captain gave a wry smile. "Couldn't find anything better for defense, so we’re making do with this. It's too hard to eat anyway; I can’t even bite into it."
 

 
To emphasize his point, he picked up the baguette and struck a nearby metal shelf twice. The force of the impact made a loud banging sound, causing the metal shelf to shake slightly, while the baguette remained completely intact. It was easy to imagine the damage it might cause if swung at someone’s head by an adult man... well, maybe not really.
 

 
[What? A baguette? Is the show serious?]
 

 
[Russian black bread could at least put up a fight!]
 

 
[Lol, such an insult to the French!]
 

 
At that moment, the special effects team added a glowing blue outline around the baguette, accompanied by mechanical sound effects, and a pop-up window displayed its item stats:
 

 
[Name]: A baguette forgotten by customers, staff, and chefs alike.
 
[Expiration date]: One year ago.
 
[Note]: As food, it’s a failed, expired product.
 
As a weapon, it’s an unmatched heavy sword with no edge.
 

 
The item description was clearly a joke.
 

 
Kong Yeming was skeptical, but the Thunder Team members actively shared their findings during their search for supplies— a small amount of medical supplies and food, as a gesture of goodwill. Kong understood that this was an act of kindness and trust, meant to prevent him from having any thoughts of greed or theft, and said, “It just so happens that we have a doctor in our team. If you have any injured members, he might be able to help.”
 

 
The Thunder Team was delighted.
 

 
Although none of them were injured at the moment, having a medical professional was certainly valuable.
 

 
Kong Yeming continued, “You guys are lucky you didn’t run into anyone else. We went to a McDonald's, and we almost got into a fight there…”
 

 
He recounted what had happened that day and then expressed a concern he hadn’t mentioned to his teammates before: “I’m pretty sure that once we ran out of McDonald’s, they didn’t follow us. That doesn’t make sense; after all, we’re not fast runners, and they were willing to use force to fight over food. Would they really be the type to give up just because we left the restaurant? We didn’t run far. I wanted to go back and take a look, but I felt it wasn’t worth the risk.”
 

 
“I think we should go back and check it out.”
 

 
The Thunder Team captain confirmed Kong’s concern: “If they’re in danger, it’s something we’ll need to face together.”
 

 
[That’s right, if your team runs into Tong Zhao, you’ll get wiped out.]
 

 
[If the two teams cooperate, Tong Zhao will be in danger; the remaining Moon and Star teams should also be able to unite. They managed to split supplies even when they couldn't communicate, so it should be easier now that they can.]
 

 
[Everyone targeting Zhao Zhao, and she can only eat instant noodles without seasoning packets.]
 

 
The two teams agreed to meet at that McDonald's the next morning at eight o'clock, after which they would search for supplies together.
 

 
With eight people working together, safety would be increased.
 

 
When Kong Yeming returned to the gathering place and spoke to his teammates, the members of the Sun Team, with the exception of Tan Jie, were usually indecisive and always followed his lead, so there were no objections this time.
 

 
The next morning at eight o'clock.
 

 
On the empty street, the two groups met right on time at the corner across from McDonald's. He Su from the Sun Team took the initiative to chat and lighten the mood as they crossed the street together. After all, the two teams had never had any conflicts, and under He Su's cheerful laughter, the atmosphere felt as relaxed as a high school field trip.
 

 
However, just ten meters from the entrance of McDonald's…
 

 
A wave of putrid stench surged into their nostrils, leaving everyone in shock.
 

 
What was that smell?
 

 
The team's mood-lifter, He Su, couldn't help but turn away and cover his mouth, gagging, while Sister Tan also changed her expression.
 

 
She knew what was causing the smell.
 

 
[Warning ahead! Protect yourselves!]
 

 
[Bros who are scared, put up your shields on the screen.]
 

 
[What’s there to be afraid of? Those corpses are just code; the real ones have probably woken up and are watching the livestream!]
 

 
The third comment was on point.
 

 
The entire Cloud Team, which had been wiped out, theoretically could be reintroduced into the reality show because their contract hadn’t expired yet. Director Chen hadn’t decided if there would be any opportunities for them to be useful again, so they were kept around to do odd jobs in the studio. Naturally, they would see the live broadcast on screen.
 

 
The Cloud Team looked at the close-up of their own corpses with complex feelings.
 

 
The broadcast version was heavily edited (adult viewers could pay to purchase an unedited version), while what they were watching backstage was the high-definition, unedited version.
 

 
The stage manager said, “Oh man, you’re in bad shape.”
 

 
The Cloud Team captain responded nonchalantly, “No, not really; it’s just a bit decayed.”
 

 
Member A asked, “Are there maggots on my face...? Wait, why are you filming me?”
 

 
Member A turned to look at a guy holding a camera filming him. The guy said he thought their conversation was quite interesting and figured that since Member A probably wouldn’t get any screen time on the show, he might as well show his face in the behind-the-scenes footage. Member A thought this was fair and encouraged the guy to film more.
 

 
The Thunder Team also had unpleasant expressions, hesitating.
 

 
Kong Yeming took a deep breath and showed the leadership expected of a captain: “I’ll go in and take a look first.”
 

 
No one objected.
 

 
He stepped inside, and through the glass door, he could already see a horrific scene.
 

 
Kong Yeming furrowed his brow and opened the door; the stench intensified, making his eyes water.
 

 
After all, it was an enclosed space with poor air circulation, and things were decaying rapidly, creating a strong odor.
 

 
A comment quietly floated by: [Fermentation is on point...]
 

 
[To the one who said “fermentation on point,” what kind of devil are you? I’ll gag in respect.]
 

 
[Is the little girl chasing after Tong Zhao scared off by the survival show's standards?]
 

 
There were definitely points that could provoke a debate. Goodness.
 

 
The girls were already a bit intimidated; who wouldn’t be? Even some of the guys were afraid of corpses, but now with the provocations, Tong Zhao's fans couldn’t sit still and began to retaliate: [What’s there to be scared of? This is an artwork made by my sister; we’re lucky to be able to appreciate it!]
 

 
[Exactly! With a filter, it’s just like other female stars posting pictures of their handmade cookies on Weibo.]
 

 
The love from these fangirls was incredibly strong!
 

 
Some particularly proactive fans even took screenshots of the blurred corpses, added a dreamy pink filter, and included them in Tong Zhao's collection of highlighted works. They used their actions to prove that the stereotype of women being timid was outdated. What’s there to be afraid of? They loved Tong Zhao, who even created the corpses, so what were a few more corpses to them?
 

 
Fangirls were not afraid of corpses.
 

 
The two teams in the variety show were genuinely scared.
 

 
Even someone like Sister Tan, a healthcare professional who was used to seeing cadavers during her studies, felt her grip tighten and chills run down her back when she thought about the presence behind the “creation” of these corpses.
 

 
Kong Yeming pinched his nose to reduce his breathing and crouched down to examine the state of the bodies.
 

 
He Su, who had finally managed to suppress his gag reflex, said, “Ugh, Captain, what’s so interesting about this?!”
 

 
The captain ignored him.
 

 
After a while, he signaled his teammates to follow him out onto the street, returning to the embrace of fresh air. He took several deep breaths to expel the faint stench of decay and said, “The fatal wound is in the throat; there are no other obvious external injuries. They were all killed by having their throats cut.”
 

 
The members of the Lightning Team looked at him with newfound respect. “Are you a forensic doctor?”
 

 
“No, just a loyal “CSI viewer.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Alright then.
 

 
Kong Yeming cleared his throat and analyzed the situation: “In other words, when we had the conflict with them, there was a third party in McDonald’s that I didn’t notice. They must have attacked them after we left the store.”
 

 
“The wounds are clean; the attackers were human.”
 

 
The captain of the Lightning Team nodded thoughtfully.
 

 
“The supplies are in my hands. If it were another team, they should be consistently pursuing us. Clearly, the ones who attacked them must be the enemy’s lackeys.”
 

 
Kong Yeming’s analysis received high praise from the audience in the live stream.
 

 
So far, everything he said was correct, and he had even guessed the identity of the murderer.
 

 
[Not bad, Mr. Kong, lucky and smart; you might just survive to the end.]
 

 
[I feel like the Lightning Team wants to side with him now.]
 

 
“I believe that the intelligence about the reinforcements was wrong, or the enemy has changed their mind,” Kong Yeming continued.
 

 
Kong Yeming's tone shifted, becoming grave: “The enemy’s lackeys are not just one; they’re not a single person but a team. That’s why they were able to take out four people in such a short amount of time! This isn’t a brawl or a fight; it’s a cold, ruthless execution. We’re in danger!”
 

 
His words jolted everyone awake from their stupor.
 

 
Yes, it was unreasonable to send just one person to wipe out twenty survivors.
 

 
With such a disparity in numbers, who would kill whom?
 

 
There must be a scheme behind this!
 

 
…
 

 
[Uh…]
 

 
[Correct reasoning process leading to the wrong conclusion.]
 

 
[Actually, it’s not really wrong; Tong Zhao alone is like an army. Is there a problem with that?]
 

 
[No problem; you’re very right.]
 

 
Understanding this point, Kong Yeming felt that uniting the other teams was now an urgent task.
 

 
At this moment, the camera suddenly pulled up, higher and higher…
 

 
Up to the edge of a rooftop of a tall building.
 

 
The first thing visible on screen were two long, perfectly white legs, creating a strong visual contrast with the pure black military boots. The camera pulled up further, revealing a pair of always bright and alert beautiful eyes coming into the audience's view.
 

 
It was her.
 

 
Duan Ge gently swayed her legs, beneath her a bottomless abyss, a maze of complex buildings, as if a single misstep would result in a fatal fall. Yet she appeared oblivious to it all, enjoying the cool breeze high above.
 

 
Everything in The City was still; there was no traffic, no throngs of people. Those walking through this city were undoubtedly her targets. Duan Ge once again occupied a high vantage point and spotted Kong Yeming and his group.
 

 
Duan Ge's eyes lit up, narrowing slightly as she tried to see more clearly.
 

 
But she was not Superman; no matter how hard she strained her eyes, she could only see the vague movement of ants.
 

 
Duan Ge whispered in frustration, “If only I had binoculars.”
 

 
Forget it, relying on the boss was not as good as relying on herself.
 

 
After locating her target, Duan Ge skillfully took a route that the audience could hardly imagine, dashing down. Just when the audience thought she was fearless enough to go anywhere, she chose a safer path while passing through an apartment.
 

 
[Eh? I thought she would jump straight across.]
 

 
Just as the audience was puzzled, the special effects team pulled up a small box.
 

 
In a picture-in-picture format, they replayed Tong Zhao's perspective, and the audience then realized—
 

 
From Tong Zhao's viewpoint, no matter how bumpy it got, running up and down, or jumping between two buildings, members of the Thunder and Sun teams were always within her line of sight.
 

 
The earlier adjustment of the route was not for safety but to avoid losing sight of her prey.
 

 
[Wow, that line of thought is quite terrifying.]
 

 
[Kong, hurry up and run!]
 

 
After exchanging information, Kong Yeming and his group illuminated their “spawn points” on the map displayed on their watches, realizing that the distance to both their spawn points and supply points was the same. They deduced that the remaining two teams’ bases wouldn’t be too far away.
 

 
They needed to find them without being discovered by the enemy…
 

 
Kong Yeming's eyes lit up: “Right, the resource package!”
 

 
He Su: “Captain?”
 

 
“The resource packages that the reinforcements drop irregularly; the drop points are known only to our five teams. We can meet there when the time comes.”
 

 
Everyone nodded in agreement; it made sense.
 

 
The female doctor was troubled by the doubts: “In my memory, the five teams couldn’t communicate because they were from different countries. I didn’t expect that when we actually met, we could communicate. The irregularly dropped resource packages also carry the implication that we should fight over them. I suspect there’s a conspiracy behind this.”
 

 
[Sister Tan is absolutely right; it’s all the fault of the dog program team.]
 

 
[Feeling sympathy for the program team for a second; the originally planned map had a bug, and in the last-minute switch, Tong Zhao, this big weapon, popped up.]
 

 
[Who would have thought Tong Zhao’s subconscious would be so fierce?]
 

 
No one thought so.
 

 
This is the interesting aspect of instinctive variety shows; the program team is not all-knowing and omnipotent. Even if they can temporarily change the rules, they cannot alter the memories in the contestants’ minds. They cannot achieve the dominion of “with the script in hand, I hold the world.” This is also one of the reasons fans find instinctive variety shows more authentic and appealing than before.
 

 
The camera pulled back again.
 

 
The camera pulled back slowly, not causing any visual discomfort, but the audience, prepared psychologically, was still startled—
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao was hanging not far behind Kong Yeming and his group!
 

 
This was in a physical sense.
 

 
She hooked onto the railing from a height and swung down, her toes landing on the huge golden “M” sign of McDonald’s. After steadying her position, she fluidly climbed down. In just two or three seconds, she reached the ground, her snowy white arms demonstrating an inexplicable strength.
 

 
A parkour-loving audience member provided some insights about core strength.
 

 
[Core strength refers to the muscles that support our upright posture. If this part is well-trained… you know about swinging your legs on parallel bars, right? That’s using core strength. Tong Zhao is the same; many of her amazing parkour moves rely on her core. Her techniques and postures while doing parkour are very standard—any extra movement is wasted, and if it’s not precise, she won’t get through. It’s incredible.]
 

 
[I shared her in our city’s parkour group, and it has now turned into a fan group for Tong Zhao. “laughs and cries”]
 

 
Netizens seemed to understand, but in any case, she was awesome!
 

 
[Tong Zhao is so popular now; if she goes out without a mask, she’ll probably be photographed. I really want to know how she trains her parkour skills while being so busy with her schedules…] The comments showed envy.
 

 
How does she train?
 

 
All the real skills were honed at the brink of life and death, and they couldn’t be forgotten.
 

 
Tong Zhao herself didn’t remember clearly due to the system’s protective measures for her consciousness—if we were to liken Tong Zhao to a computer, her main personality would be the C drive, containing only the necessary content, while the other assorted skills would be stored in her sub-personality, lightening the load.
 

 
With her toes on the asphalt road, Duan Ge turned her gaze toward the prey.
 

 
Light enveloped her, casting a gentle halo around her.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I can’t understand what they’re saying.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [There are so many people; it’s a bit difficult to take action, so I’ll just follow them.]
 

 
In the audience’s imagination, following meant something very animated, like hiding behind a telephone pole and trailing along step by step.
 

 
But Duan Ge’s tracking was not like that.
 

 
She only ensured that those people remained in her line of sight; everything else was irrelevant. She didn’t mind lagging far behind, fluctuating between distance and closeness, filled with patience. Following and sniping are both disciplines that test one’s patience. There will always be answers at the end of tracking; if there aren’t, then you shouldn’t have embarked on this path in the first place.
 

 
Sometimes the audience felt anxious for her, but she remained unhurried, maintaining a distance that wouldn’t raise suspicion.
 

 
Duan Ge saw them arrive at the Julong residences, then change locations, and finally come to a primary school with two boxes of supplies—
 

 
This was the third supply point.
 

 
It was also the place where Star Team and Moon Team completed their transaction through gestures.
 

 
Originally, avoiding other teams meant they shouldn’t have come to such a place, but now their target had shifted, and using a supply point where other teams might come looking as a base was Captain Kong Yeming’s suggestion. Moreover, a primary school was itself a good choice… it was more reliable for escape or defense than residential buildings and had more places to hide supplies.
 

 
……
 

 
After a day of busyness…
 

 
Although they didn’t find new food sources, everyone took a portable gas stove, a frying pan, and some gas canisters from Walmart, deciding to heat the food in the cans before eating.
 

 
“No matter how hard life gets, we still need a sense of ritual.”
 

 
He Su rubbed his fists in anticipation.
 

 
“Yeah, we can find food again. Since Brother Zhang found a baguette that expired a year ago in the bakery, it shows that finding resources in Canaan City isn’t hopeless,” said Team Lightning member A, agreeing. “Besides, there are eight of us. How could we possibly lose when competing for the airdrop supply packages?”
 

 
Kong Yeming smoothed things over, saying, “Let’s try to unite everyone first; after all, we don’t know the number of enemy lackeys.”
 

 
“Stop talking about that. Let’s just throw in a few slices of lunch meat!”
 

 
The lunch meat slid onto the heated frying pan with a sizzle, releasing fat and filling the air with an irresistible aroma that captivated everyone present. He Su took a deep breath and sighed, “It’s true that lunch meat tastes better when it’s fried. Yesterday, eating cold bread with cold meat made my heart feel cold too.”
 

 
“Yeah, it was really hard to eat.”
 

 
“You talk too much. The first slice is yours, okay?”
 

 
Seeing that the lunch meat was nearly done frying, Kong Yeming picked up a piece and stuffed it into a sliced piece of bread before handing it to He Su.
 

 
He was starving, so he took the bread and started munching on it.
 

 
The edges of the pan-fried lunch meat were crispy, but biting into it revealed tender meat inside. The hot grease seeped into the fluffy white bread, making it so delicious that it made him feel as if his soul had left his body.
 

 
In survival variety shows, this kind of gathering to eat rare food is a classic scene that many variety show fans love. It looks especially appetizing and allows them to reflect on the difficulties of survival.
 

 
The sizzling sound of frying meat made everyone’s mouths water.
 

 
The oil and meat aroma intertwined, accompanied by wisps of white steam slowly rising…
 

 
Rising.
 

 
It reached the ventilation duct in the ceiling.
 

 
Duan Ge crouched in the ventilation pipe and looked down.
 

 
The view from the school auditorium was too open for her to follow closely behind, so she chose to sneak through the ventilation duct to see the situation. If anyone was alone, she could take the chance to eliminate them. Unfortunately, there had been no opportunity; they even went to the restroom together, likely already on guard.
 

 
She had a feeling she would be out for a long time today, so even though she was really dissatisfied with the instant noodles her boss had given her, she still took them along and stuffed them into her waist pouch. To her surprise, this group was getting carried away and actually started frying meat!
 

 
This was outrageous!
 

 
The aroma shot straight to Duan Ge's head, making her feel a little defensive and wanting to jump down and kill them all.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m so angry.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Stay calm. There are too many people; I can’t take them on.]
 

 
Duan Ge was very rational.
 

 
After all, this wasn’t a world of magic and martial arts; she wasn’t a terrifyingly powerful fighting master. Her slender and agile figure was better suited for ambushes and assassinations.
 

 
[Hahaha, it’s really tragic!]
 

 
[The bunny is furious!]
 

 
[When a rabbit is cornered, it will bite! So what if she can’t win? She can still jump down and go all out!]
 

 
That was impossible.
 

 
Even if she faced four opponents, it wouldn’t make her heart race. It was just a hot meal; what did that count for? Duan Ge turned over, facing away from the ground, and pulled out a cup of Master Kong instant noodles from the dark ventilation duct…
 

 
Fortunately, this time she finally had a seasoning packet.
 

 
Below, there were sounds of laughter and joy, while above, there was a crackle of crispness.
# Chapter71
After finishing the instant noodles, Duan Ge fell into serious contemplation.
 

 
She was considering the possibility of slitting their throats one by one after they fell asleep.
 

 
But Kong Yeming was quite cautious. He didn’t leave only one person on watch but insisted that two people stand guard, with one person from the Thunder Squad and one from the Sun Squad each time: "Not only can they chat and bond, but it also improves safety."
 

 
“I have no issue with chatting, sounds nice,”
 

 
He Su, who loved to talk, scratched his head. “But usually, only one person keeps watch, right?”
 

 
“There are too many unexpected situations if it’s just one person.”
 

 
Kong Yeming shook his head.
 

 
Everyone trusted his judgment completely, and no one objected.
 

 
So, Duan Ge waited for a while, watching as they ate until they were full, using bread to soak up the gravy and finishing the canned food completely. She waited until they covered themselves with the backstage theater props and tried to sleep... but two tall men still remained awake, sitting to the side and chatting.
 

 
Duan Ge: [With two people standing guard, setting fire in the auditorium is also not an option.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [My biggest advantage right now is that they are in the open, while I am in the shadows. They still don’t know I’m nearby. Unless I can ensure a reduction in their numbers with one strike, I can’t act rashly and alert them.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is so pitiful, it really broke my defenses watching him. Can’t they give the kid something good to eat?]
 

 
[Why not sneak down and steal some food?]
 

 
[Congrats to both teams for successfully avoiding a death flag.]
 

 
Did they really avoid it?
 

 
In the middle of the night, the Thunder Squad's guard urgently needed to use the bathroom. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he mentioned it to the Sun Squad’s guard before getting up to go. By then, everyone who should have been asleep was in a deep slumber, and only a few dedicated viewers were still watching the livestream.
 

 
One advantage of a 24-hour live-stream variety show is that it’s great for night owls to keep on in the background. Many “urban immortals” who stay up all night working or gaming like to keep interesting live streams playing in a small window, glancing at them only when something exciting happens.
 

 
Going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, an everyday action, didn’t catch much attention from the audience.
 

 
The restroom was just outside the primary school auditorium, down the corridor. If the door was open, a shout could be heard immediately in the stillness of the night.
 

 
The other guard chose to stay by the sleeping teammates, urging him to be quick and continue their earlier conversation: "When you get back, I’ll tell you about my second girlfriend."
 

 
The Thunder Squad guard didn’t turn around but raised his hand, signaling an OK gesture.
 

 
After stepping outside, his pace faltered. An inexplicable sixth sense made him stop. He looked ahead—clouds had covered the moon, cutting off the only source of natural light. The pitch-black corridor looked like the gaping maw of some monster, and the night wind blowing through the railings should have made it cool and comfortable.
 

 
But the guard felt as if he had stepped into a mass of jelly.
 

 
His legs felt rooted to the ground, and he hesitated to take another step forward.
 

 
Instinct was telling him not to go any further.
 

 
But compared to the vague sixth sense, the urgency from his full bladder was more convincing. The Thunder Squad guard shook his head, laughing at himself inwardly, thinking he had been overly cautious due to Kong Yeming’s influence.
 

 
His silhouette disappeared into the darkness.
 

 
A slender shadow flashed by, hanging outside the railing.
 

 
Everything happened too quickly.
 

 
So fast that if the show didn’t provide a replay, viewers who weren’t paying attention to the livestream would have completely missed it. A dagger sliced through his throat and vocal cords effortlessly, like cutting through soft tofu. There was no need for light to precisely find the vital point of the prey. The dagger was the assassin’s fang, sinking into the throat with a single, lethal strike.
 

 
“Ugh...!”
 

 
A brief cry barely escaped before it was reduced to a whisper.
 

 
In terror and panic, the Thunder Squad guard tried to make a sound to warn his teammates, to call for help, but it was already too late. The assassin lurking in the dark had anticipated this, giving him no chance to utter another word.
 

 
[An Imperial Assassin is not interested in hearing any pleas from their prey.]
 

 
Another fatality, and the special effects team immediately released the poetic closing line they had long prepared.
 

 
[The show’s crew really puts effort into creating the right atmosphere.]
 

 
[This style is amazing, I’m saving this as my signature!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [It seemed like he wanted to say something?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Oh well, even if he did, I wouldn’t have understood it anyway.]
 

 
[...Our Tong Zhao is really committed to ruining the mood.]
 

 
[Rabbits shouldn’t refer to themselves as “laozi”!]
 

 
[Cover the rabbit’s mouth >w<]
 

 
Since it was the middle of the night, even though the show provided a replay, the number of comments in the live chat was minimal, allowing for relaxed conversations. Yet, among the few comments, about a third were in English: [Is this Tong Zhao? (in English)], [Cool!!!!!!!], [I’ve only seen moves like this in ‘Naruto’; if she had a kunai, it would be even better (in English)], and [Shut up, this is Chinese Kung Fu, not Japanese ninjutsu!].
 

 
Thanks to the advanced translation software of this era, a simple click would display translated content.
 

 
Though not always elegant, the translation was accurate enough.
 

 
The Chinese viewers still watching the stream were shocked.
 

 
They wanted to say…
 

 
Actually, this is neither Japanese ninjutsu nor Chinese Kung Fu!
 

 
What misunderstanding do you have about Chinese Kung Fu?
 

 
The Thunder Squad guard, who had his throat slit, struggled fiercely. However, Duan Ge used all her strength to shoulder-check him into the cold wall. The collision of flesh and wall made no sound, and he breathed his last in unwillingness. Duan Ge held up the tall man with both hands, preventing the loud noise of his body hitting the ground. She slowly placed him against the wall, sitting him in a pool of his own blood.
 

 
Whew, whew...
 

 
An assassin is no bodybuilder—while she could deliver precise and deadly attacks in a short time, moving a heavy human body still took considerable effort.
 

 
It was such a terrifying task to deal with a corpse—
 

 
Yet, when she did it, why did it somehow feel like a cute little bunny struggling to pull out a giant carrot?
 

 
The blood splattered from his artery formed bright red blossoms against the wall.
 

 
Duan Ge bent down for a moment, taking the watch and glasses off the man's wrist.
 

 
In the pitch-black environment, only her eyes glowed faintly.
 

 
That tiny glimmer of light sent a chill through the hearts of all the night owls watching, jolting them wide awake.
 

 
The assassin's reflection appeared in the restroom mirror.
 

 
At some point, the clouds had drifted away from the moon, and moonlight poured through the door. She quickly turned her head, the light tracing her high-bridged nose and slightly pouted lips, making her look like a mysterious and dangerous yet beautiful creature.
 

 
The assassin, with a displeased expression, let out a soft grunt.
 

 
Duan Ge: [That's what you get for eating meat.]
 

 
After silently eliminating one person, Duan Ge left without a sound and returned upstairs to resume her short nap.
 

 
...
 

 
Twenty minutes passed, and the other guard, He Su, began to sense something was off when the man didn’t return.
 

 
In such dangerous times, even if someone had diarrhea, they should still hurry back!
 

 
"Why is he taking so long…"
 

 
At that moment, He Su's instincts saved his life.
 

 
Instead of getting up and rushing out to investigate, he chose to wake up his captain, Kong Yeming. This small disturbance also woke up the Thunder Squad members, who hadn’t slept well. They rubbed their bleary eyes as He Su explained the situation. Some teased him for being overly cautious while they got up to check the restroom together.
 

 
What they found was a floor covered in fresh blood and their teammate’s corpse.
 

 
Everyone turned pale and, leaning against the walls, vomited violently.
 

 
The meat they ate that night ended up being for nothing.
 

 
On the other floor, Duan Ge, hearing the commotion, curved her lips into a smile, revealing a satisfied expression in her sleep.
 

 
Unable to control his emotions, He Su yelled, “If you have the guts, come out! Hiding and ambushing doesn’t make you a hero! Aren’t there a lot of you? Come out!”
 

 
Duan Ge turned over in her sleep.
 

 
Duan Ge: [So lively.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [They must be really full for their voices to be so loud.]
 

 
Kong Yeming said, “Let’s get some rest first. Only when we’re well-rested can we fight back.”
 

 
With death threats lurking nearby, no one dared to ignore Kong Yeming’s words anymore. The strong men huddled together, trembling, and even Sister Tan was treated like a cherished pet, protected on the inside. His decision was indeed correct. Duan Ge exerted psychological pressure while ensuring she could eliminate members. Continuous sleep deprivation would dull people’s reactions and lead to poor decisions, which could be fatal in close-quarters combat.
 

 
Duan Ge enjoyed a good, restful sleep.
 

 
...
 

 
In the later edited version, the production team carefully cut this segment of the kill.
 

 
It turned out that after everyone settled down to rest and decided to have two people keep watch, Duan Ge went upstairs to the corridor on the second floor to rest. She was a light sleeper, waking up at the slightest noise. When someone passed by downstairs, she immediately woke up, flipped down like a bat, and truly achieved the feat of killing one person in ten steps.
 

 
When Director Chen woke up in the morning and checked the high-energy segments from the night, a chill ran down his neck, leaving him speechless.
 

 
If it weren't for the control panel nearby, allowing him to intervene in the variety show world at any time…
 

 
This was practically a crime scene.
 

 
What kind of subconscious has he invited?
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really not a fugitive hiding in the entertainment industry?
 

 
The assistant director voiced what everyone was thinking: “Should we… call the police?”
 

 
“Call the police for what?!”
 

 
Director Chen summoned his fist, ready to attack, and punched the assistant director lightly. “It’s just a variety show! How long has Tong Zhao’s face been popular in the country? If she were a fugitive, how could she have escaped until now? It must be that our script is just too good and fits her perfectly!”
 

 
While the assistant director obediently took the hit, he secretly reminded himself not to provoke this female star.
 

 
She was too scary!
 

 
...
 

 
Kong Yeming and the others worked hard to sleep, but they didn’t rest well.
 

 
Duan Ge, on the other hand, had a good rest and woke up early, stirred by her superior’s message—
 

 
“Based on your known intelligence, choose a location for the gas deployment!”
 

 
The modified phone, now stripped down to only its essential functions, alerted her that she could choose a location for the gas deployment.
 

 
Duan Ge calculated the time and figured that the survivors in the school should be waking up soon. The possibility of them being poisoned in their sleep was low... However, she still held onto the thoughts of “what if” and “it doesn’t hurt to try,” deciding to deploy the gas at this school.
 

 
She skillfully crawled back into the ventilation duct, lying prone at a small window in the ceiling to observe below.
 

 
With half an hour left until deployment, their watches, tucked away in Duan Ge's waist pouch, lit up.
 

 
Duan Ge pulled out the vibrating watch—
 

 
This was the watch she had taken off the Thunder Squad guard's wrist last night, and it was now displaying a miniature map of Canaan City, with a red dot flashing. After double-tapping to zoom in, she saw that the red dot indicated the location of the school.
 

 
Immediately after, she saw the fugitives below hurriedly packing supplies and belongings, preparing to leave.
 

 
Hmm?
 

 
Duan Ge tilted her head slightly.
 

 
The special effects team had placed a small light bulb above her head.
 

 
Duan Ge: [Has the information leaked...?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Receiving news half an hour early means this gas deployment won’t be lethal. Unless I can create a sealed room they can’t escape from... Ah, I realized too late. If I had known, I would have figured out how to block all the doors last night.]
 

 
When Duan Ge replayed the situation in her mind, her tone was remarkably calm; she didn’t feel frustrated at all.
 

 
[Tong Zhao is truly the most transcendent variety show guest I’ve ever seen…]
 

 
[I want to see her play a female assassin in a movie QAQ]
 

 
The fact that the fugitives could learn about the gas deployment location half an hour in advance didn’t affect Duan Ge’s confidence at all. She simply noted this time difference for future reference.
 

 
At this point, the Sun Team was down to seven members.
 

 
[Fugitives: 15/20]
 

 
When this data appeared in the upper right corner, a comment popped up in the barrage: [Did Sister Zhao just get a Penta Kill?]
 

 
[Too bad it wasn’t a streak.]
 

 
[But it’s all Solo Kills—impressive!]
 

 
Coincidentally, with the ongoing esports world championship, viewers immediately started discussing and wanted to see Tong Zhao portray an esports player—she displayed the calm and steady demeanor that professional players needed most. It was clear she was a high-level competitor, the kind who wouldn’t lose her cool even in the fifth game.
 

 
As Tong Zhao followed the Sun and Thunder Teams to “run the gas” and change their location ahead of time, the production team behind the scenes confidently shifted their focus to the remaining two teams...
 

 
Not only did they closely monitor the guests' progress, but the entire staff also had to keep track of the competition situation while observing the live stream comments, aiming to stir the audience’s emotions and enhance the entertainment value of the show, setting up dramatic twists while ensuring everything could wrap up neatly.
 

 
The dramatic twist of Tong Zhao instantaneously taking out four people was already enough to satisfy the audience, who were left exhilarated.
 

 
It just nearly couldn’t wrap back up.
 

 
This was also something the director was eager to avoid.
 

 
From the observation cameras, it could be seen that the Star and Moon Teams were back on track.
 

 
They had settled down at locations ten minutes apart. After seeing that the first gas deployment was far from them, they all relaxed, becoming more proactive in searching for supplies. With a large area of Canaan City rendered inactive, the likelihood of conflict with other teams increased.
 

 
The early bird gets the worm.
 

 
Just when it seemed like things were calming down, the production team dropped the first resource supply pack—
 

 
And informed all team members via their watches that this supply pack contained lethal weapons!
 

 
Upon seeing the content on the watch, the Sun Team leader, Kong Yeming, changed his expression.
 

 
In the control room...
 

 
During lunchtime, when the viewership peaked, the director satisfiedly pressed the drop button: “What’s the point of them all settling down? It’s all about creating suspense. If they really unite, there won’t be much excitement left.” From the production team’s perspective, Tong Zhao was capable of killing and winning, but she shouldn’t do it too quickly.
 

 
Facilitating communication between the teams was meant to slow down her killing pace.
 

 
Dropping weapons was not only giving the players the means to resist but also lighting the fuse for conflict.
 

 
It was also a carefully prepared climax for the audience.
 

 
A helicopter slowly flew into the skies above Canaan City.
 

 
All the contestants looked up in unison.
 

 
Once again, standing at a high vantage point, Duan Ge also raised her head, observing the helicopter's flight path, thinking: What is that thing?
 

 
As soon as the thought crossed her mind, she pulled out the gun from her waist.
 

 
It had only one bullet, coming from her unscrupulous boss and the show's "supply resources." She hadn’t used it while killing, thinking it would be a waste of a bullet, but now she took it out without hesitation.
 

 
Seeing this scene, Director Chen's eyes widened: "That’s impossible to hit; this isn’t a movie—there’s no guaranteed hit coding…"
 

 
That's right. In many instinctive films, the “marksmen” and “snipers” have every bullet pre-programmed with automatic navigation codes, enabling them to achieve dramatic, guaranteed hits. Such coding is too detailed and needs to be incorporated early in the world-building; it’s not easy to implement in an instinctive variety show.
 

 
Moreover, the production team didn't want to give Tong Zhao that kind of treatment.
 

 
One dagger and two arrows could take out a team.
 

 
Would they really give her a gun that never misses? As if they thought she wasn’t killing quickly enough?
 

 
However, Duan Ge's marksmanship had withstood countless real-world tests; her physical abilities were slightly above average, and her dynamic vision was comparable to that of a hawk.
 

 
Her eyes narrowed slightly.
 

 
The shot was quick, so quick that the data couldn't be altered in time.
 

 
The shot was loud, loud enough that all the contestants drawn by the helicopter's presence saw this scene.
 

 
A dark figure brought the helicopter down—
 

 
This was obviously impossible.
 

 
It couldn't be done scientifically, nor could it be accomplished in the world of variety shows.
 

 
But the problem was that the knot hanging the supply drop package was a relatively large target. When the helicopter flew low, Duan Ge, standing on the rooftop water tank of the building, was quite close…
 

 
One could only say that Duan Ge's habit of occupying the high ground led the production team to forget about this possibility.
 

 
When that supply package crashed down right in front of Duan Ge, the director gritted his teeth: "Who the hell used a helicopter for a supply drop? Should have used a plane!"
 

 
Modeling Technician: "Uh, didn’t you say that the rental cost for the helicopter model is cheaper, Director?"
 

 
Director: "..."
 

 
He didn’t really expect something to appear at such a height.
 

 
Isn't the show's budget squeezed out by cutting costs here and there?
 

 
Speaking of which, the financial strain was partly due to Duan Ge's somewhat high remuneration.
 

 
"Hiss..."
 

 
The director slapped his forehead.
 

 
At the same time, Duan Ge had already opened the huge box, revealing it was filled to the brim with weapons.
 

 
Duan Ge: "...Wow."
 

 
[Poor Zhao Zhao, suddenly rich like a rabbit!]
 

 
[It’s over, it’s over! The big shot has got a full magazine; how are we going to fight with that?]
 

 
[I’m dying of laughter! Can she really shoot that down? Isn’t this set up by the production team?]
 

 
The livestream timely gave her a close-up.
 

 
Duan Ge's eyes widened brightly as she touched the weapons. Underneath them were military rations, the kind that could heat up with just a little cold water.
 

 
Duan Ge: “This definitely isn’t our military’s supplies.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “It must be from those fugitives…”
 

 
She stood up holding the box, carefully searching for an escape route while seriously contemplating:
 

 
[Is it too late to change jobs now?]
# Chapter72
Where’s the air support drop?
 

 
In the sky, flying, being hoisted by a helicopter, such a large supply drop?
 

 
All the players on the ground looked up, craning their necks in confusion, still unable to figure out what was happening.
 

 
The helicopter, following its pre-set flight path, slowly flew to the planned drop location. In front of the four teams preparing to compete for the supplies, it gradually dropped a long, thick hemp rope that had been broken. The point of impact was charred black, and there was nothing below.
 

 
It was a lonely drop.
 

 
After completing the “drop” motion, the helicopter continued to fly forward.
 

 
He Su shouted, “Hey, there’s nothing here!”
 

 
But this question was clearly in vain.
 

 
The program had no emotions, and the code had no reason.
 

 
The helicopter did not answer his question and continued flying without a hint of feeling.
 

 
He Su, looking hurt, bounced a couple of times in place: “What the heck? Can’t it at least check if the supplies were properly delivered to us? What’s going on with this air support? Totally unreliable! There’s nothing less reliable than our superiors…”
 

 
The captain held him down, signaling him to stop making a fuss.
 

 
The bullet comments responded to his question:
 

 
[Hello, there is.]
 

 
[There’s hot food to eat, and they’re sending weapons. Isn’t that reliable? Much more reliable than the enemy.]
 

 
[So funny, doesn’t the production team consider letting Tong Zhao understand what they’re saying?]
 

 
[I suspect that if Sister Zhao heard it, she’d be so furious that she’d start shooting at all the sharks.]
 

 
The resource supply drop that sparked the dispute was intercepted, and everyone lost their reason to initiate a conflict. Kong Yeming took the initiative to talk to the two teams who looked hesitant, sharing the information he knew and the potential situations they might face, in order to gain their trust.
 

 
Reflecting on the tragic deaths of the Thunder team members, Kong Yeming couldn’t help but feel a bit gloomy: “Looking back now, two people guarding the night really isn’t safe enough.”
 

 
“After all, we don’t have many people; Brother Kong has already thought things through thoroughly.”
 

 
The Thunder team members comforted him in return.
 

 
Kong Yeming waved his hand and continued, “Now that all fifteen of us are gathered here, it means that the person who shot down the supply drop earlier doesn’t belong to our camp. They are likely one of the Empire's lackeys, one of those who killed our team members. Since we were able to learn the location of the gas drop in advance, it’s also possible that they know we have a supply drop coming.”
 

 
“So that person just now…”
 

 
Moon Team member A recalled.
 

 
Everything happened very quickly, and with Duan Ge standing on top of a water tank on a rooftop, it was too high. When they heard the gunshot and looked over, they only caught a fleeting shadow and couldn’t even tell if it was a man or a woman. However, both teams were frightened by Kong Yeming's description of the brutal enemy, and coupled with the incredible marksmanship that seemed to have an aimbot, the team quickly agreed to take action together after a brief discussion.
 

 
The Moon Team agreed, and the Star Team had no choice but to nod and join in.
 

 
This wasn’t because their team names had a sense of harmony or couple dynamics.
 

 
The Star Team captain thought to himself, “If I’m the only one who doesn’t join, wouldn’t our four people become isolated targets? Acting as a group is the safest option.”
 

 
Since the two teams had encountered each other before Director Chen decided to change to a “common language” format, the events that had occurred couldn’t be altered. Thus, the language between the two teams remained unintelligible, and they relied on the remaining survivors to translate.
 

 
From Duan Ge’s perspective, it sounded like a perfectly identical encrypted communication in gibberish.
 

 
It was something akin to “wabi wabi, wabi baba.”
 

 
“After hearing about Mr. Shen's (the fallen Thunder Night Watcher) experiences, I’m too scared to go to the restroom alone,” one member of the Star Team said with a bitter smile.
 

 
Even though these survivors had never directly encountered the assassin, the ominous shadow of terror weighed heavily on their hearts. In Kong Yeming's description, they possessed the combat power to quickly subdue four tall adult men, patiently lurking, and would never engage in prolonged battles after eliminating one target.
 

 
All they had seen were cold corpses; they had never witnessed a fight.
 

 
“This is just like a vengeful spirit…” he whispered.
 

 
At that moment, the live broadcast displayed a line of special effects text in white against a black background:
 

 
“The mysterious assassin no one has ever seen, a predator moving through the darkness…”
 

 
“So, in the imagination of the contestants, what do they think the assassin looks like?”
 

 
Bullet screen: [This way of speaking has a Japanese variety show vibe to it.]
 

 
[The world's poorest assassin!]
 

 
[The rabbit princess reigning over Canaan City?]
 

 
A blue line appeared above the heads of the fifteen contestants, and as they pulled it upward, fifteen scanned images appeared with a swish—
 

 
These images embodied the empire’s assassin as imagined in their minds: muscular and brawny men, a classic bearded killer wearing sunglasses, lean figures that clearly seemed like they could take action, and a few who were too timid to imagine anything, resulting in a mental image of nothing but deep black fog.
 

 
Through the same actions of description, the images that people conjured up could differ vastly.
 

 
However, they all shared one common point…
 

 
[Uh, why are they all male?]
 

 
Among the fifteen scanned images, not a single one depicted a woman.
 

 
In the contestants’ imaginations, they defaulted to the assumption that this powerful and cold assassin was male.
 

 
The live broadcast screen was briefly dominated by question marks and ellipses.
 

 
Stereotypes regarding gender and strength reside deep within people’s hearts; we all know they exist, yet when they are blatantly displayed on the screen, ordinary individuals still feel discomfort. After a moment of unease, the audience began to anticipate their reactions upon finally encountering the assassin in person.
 

 
So, what is the beautiful and handsome assassin sister doing?
 

 
The live camera panned to the top floor of an abandoned industrial building, which was also Duan Ge’s “birth point.”
 

 
A wisp of white mist rose.
 

 
Duan Ge was having a meal.
 

 
She opened two large cans.
 

 
One was sardines in tomato sauce, and the other was a can of luncheon meat.
 

 
Duan Ge placed the fish and meat on top of the self-heating rice, pressing it down tightly, and let it steam for a while. When she opened the lid, the audience was struck by the excessiveness of this meal… the sweet and sour tomato sauce from the sardines seeped into the slightly hard rice, and each bite was filled with meat, the savory flavor coating her entire palate.
 

 
After several consecutive meals of bland, tasteless instant noodles, Duan Ge's sense of taste had almost been neglected.
 

 
This steaming can-topped rice completely awakened her taste buds!
 

 
She ate quietly, without making exaggerated slurping sounds, her brows and eyes subtly curving with happiness, which was incredibly contagious.
 

 
[Ah, this…]
 

 
In that moment, even those who weren’t fans of Tong Zhao could understand her cute point.
 

 
This was clearly a rare instance of a bunny getting a hearty meal!
 

 
With such a cute bunny, why would they let her go hungry? The production team deserves a beating!
 

 
Tong Zhao's looks really can make an impact.
 

 
While fans were being charmed, some passersby couldn't tear their eyes away from the screen, secretly thinking.
 

 
Duan Ge was obviously starving.
 

 
When she ate heartily, her expression was focused and serious, her cheeks bulging with rice and meat, completely contrasting with the cold and capable image she usually projected 90% of the time. If she behaved like this all the time, it would lose its special charm; people are creatures of novelty, needing visual stimulation, and occasionally seeing this kind of side on screen…
 

 
Ah, it's hard to tell whether it's the aroma of the rice or the scent of Tong Zhao.
 

 
...
 

 
After finishing her meal, Duan Ge eagerly began to examine the spoils of this round.
 

 
In the production team's plans, Kong Yeming and his team were supposed to seize the airdrop, gaining weapons and an advantage, slightly tipping the scales in their favor. The airdrop box contained a variety of weapons—
 

 
First was the most common type, a rifle that was easy to use.
 

 
She looked at the three fully loaded magazines in her hand and then at the one bullet her dog-like boss had given her, now already fired from the empty handgun...
 

 
Duan Ge felt a surge of dissatisfaction again.
 

 
There was a very powerful machine gun, and when Duan Ge's fair little hand touched the black firearm, a segment of official commentary appeared:
 

 
“The production team did not provide Tong Zhao with the instructions or usage for these weapons.”
 

 
“Because they were not prepared for her at all...!!”
 

 
The underlying resentment in the words amused the audience.
 

 
But could this really stump Duan Ge?
 

 
Not a chance.
 

 
“This gun has a very fast firing rate; it's a bit unstable, so I need to be careful,” she pondered. “But it’s great for defending a building; it can handle multiple opponents pretty well.”
 

 
The box also contained two sniper rifles and an eight-times scope.
 

 
“If I take this…”
 

 
Duan Ge curled her lips, creating a troubled arc.
 

 
The audience thought she wouldn’t be able to use the sniper rifle.
 

 
“Isn't that a bit unfair?”
 

 
...
 

 
“Alright, I’m willing to call her the strongest force.”
 

 
“If anyone else said that, I’d think they were just trying to show off, but my sister Zhao really can do it.”
 

 
“By the way, didn’t we find out about Tong Zhao’s background before? After seeing all her impressive moves in the reality show, I still think this girl is incredible; she’s not like ordinary people.”
 

 
“I’m a bit confused—did Tong Zhenming raise his daughter with the intent of making her a special forces soldier?”
 

 
Tong Zhenming felt innocent, but he wasn’t entirely sure.
 

 
Because Tong Zhao’s school emphasized “quality education,” she took numerous extracurricular classes. Not to mention the usual ones like piano, violin, tennis, and calligraphy, but some boys were interested in learning shooting. Anyway, he was only responsible for transferring the tuition fees from his card each semester. What if Tong Zhao had learned these things without him knowing? He could only scoff at the thought that she didn’t act like a proper girl.
 

 
Just as the comments were discussing Tong Zhao's background, a line of official special effects text appeared again:
 

 
“Even if you’re cheating, you have to follow the basic rules!”
 

 
“Since this is an exclusive weapon for fugitives, the little thief rabbit is prohibited from using it /heart/heart.”
 

 
The official commentary subtitle was being cute, but the analysis that followed was very serious: “The weapon resources from the reinforcements utilize brand new technology. The fingerprints of all twenty survivors can unlock these weapons, and they cannot be used unless unlocked.”
 

 
“Cold weapons are not subject to this restriction.”
 

 
In other words, although she was restricted from exclusively using these bug-like weapons, she still obtained a crowbar, a crossbow, an axe, and the telescope she had longed for.
 

 
After all, this unexpected operation of intercepting the airdrop was an impressive maneuver that the production team highly recognized. They couldn't simply discourage her enthusiasm for completing the mission but could only secretly adjust the balance.
 

 
...
 

 
The more cute she acted in front of the audience, the more seasoned she was behind the scenes.
 

 
Director Chen lit a cigarette, biting it with satisfaction: “Fortunately, the batch of firearms we rented came with identity verification functions; otherwise, we would have been in serious trouble.”
 

 
“Even humanoid self-driving hacks need to be sanctioned by the officials!”
# Chapter73
Duan Ge quickly discovered the issue with the firearms.
 

 
She had never dealt with such high-tech equipment, so she naturally couldn't figure out how to unlock them.
 

 
Just as she frowned in confusion, she found a manual at the bottom of the box. After reading the brief introduction, her expression immediately fell.
 

 
[Facepalm.jpg]
 

 
[Sister Zhao might be ungrateful, but the production team is really the worst.]
 

 
[Why would firearms have instruction manuals?]
 

 
A line of special effects text quickly addressed the audience's confusion:
 

 
《Since we're pursuing the unethical, we must follow through completely!》
 

 
《That's right, that instruction manual was hastily compiled by our modeling team in a burst of speed and placed inside!》
 

 
The audience was delighted.
 

 
It was evident that, in addition to the two opposing factions, this survival variety show also featured an invisible conflict—Tong Zhao versus the relentless production team. Such a confrontation was rare in the world; typically, it was the director who maintained tight control over the guests. No one expected Sister Zhao to turn the tables and repeatedly surprise the audience.
 

 
Viewers had grown a bit weary of traditional variety shows.
 

 
They would wonder which parts were meticulously arranged by the production team, and what meaning there was in their emotional ups and downs. The conflicts that occurred in variety shows were all scripted by the director, differing only slightly from movies in terms of portraying real human emotions.
 

 
Unlike movies, variety show fans looked forward to the unexpected.
 

 
When they saw the production team flustered by the endless surprises from the special guests, that anticipation was fully met.
 

 
Some viewers watch reality shows hoping to see celebrities fail.
 

 
If the celebrities don’t fail, then fine, let the famous production team take the fall instead!
 

 
Past guests who have appeared on "One Life Survivor" continue to follow this show, frequently venting their frustrations on Weibo. Most of them are unknowns or ordinary people, so initially, no one paid them any attention. Until one former contestant who made a name for themselves on the show posted:
 

 
@Long Jue v:
 

 
“If I have such opponents, I probably won’t win the prize.”
 

 
Although they didn't name names, those in the know immediately understood who they were talking about.
 

 
Fans quickly replied, insisting, “How could that be? Brother is the best!”
 

 
As for the retweets from bystanders and marketing accounts, most were looking forward to a clash between the two.
 

 
A few insightful individuals commented: “They’re a legitimate movie star who just finished shooting a wildly successful blockbuster, and they’re booked solid with offers… Variety shows are just for fun; what’s with all the hype about a showdown like Tyson vs. Ali?”
 

 
Thinking about it carefully, that was indeed the case.
 

 
[Ah, but this is still really fun! Just thinking about it is amusing!]
 

 
Fun and interesting.
 

 
This is truly the ultimate answer in this era of entertainment, the only currency more effective than beauty.
 

 
Long Jue's Weibo post created quite a buzz, coinciding with a day that lacked major entertainment news. Netizens, bored and scrolling through a dull homepage, found a marketing account that had dug up previous guest comments from "One Life Survivor" about this episode. They compiled a collection of the guests reveling in the production team’s misfortune, which naturally led to a wave of shares and laughter.
 

 
More curious onlookers, eager to see how Tong Zhao could turn a deadlock into something spectacular, flooded into the live stream. When it came time to choose a contestant they were interested in, they unhesitatingly picked Tong Zhao, proudly displaying their "freebie" fan badge...
 

 
Backstage, a tally was taken...
 

 
Sure enough, Tong Zhao’s votes completely overwhelmed the competition.
 

 
The focus was gradually drifting away from the planned direction of the variety show.
 

 
While the production team could control the resources Tong Zhao received, the audience's expectations were beyond their control.
 

 
Strictly speaking, having Tong Zhao on "One Life Survivor" was an invisible confrontation between the second dimension and the third dimension, a challenge from humanity to God!
 

 
…
 

 
Viewers were enjoying the show to the point of exasperation and found Tong Zhao extremely entertaining.
 

 
This woman was like an endless book, full of inexhaustible talents and never-ending bravado.
 

 
The production team thought Tong Zhao was out of options.
 

 
Meanwhile, the audience was enthusiastic about offering her strategies, as if she could actually hear them—
 

 
[Why not just cut off the thumb from the previous corpse?]
 

 
[You must not have seen many dramas; fingerprint unlocking technology relies not only on having a hand but also on body temperature and pressure sensitivity… A person’s body temperature drops quickly after death, so even if you had the finger of a deceased fugitive, the usable period would only be three hours; after that, it would start to stiffen and be ineffective.]
 

 
[As long as you have a hand, it's fine, hahaha. That’s a weird sense of humor that really hit the mark.]
 

 
Duan Ge tentatively reported this issue to her superior.
 

 
“I’ve captured a batch of weapons supply from the survivors, but I can’t use them because of the fingerprint authentication lock. Is there a solution?”
 

 
In Duan Ge’s understanding, her superiors were quite capable.
 

 
It was just that most of the time, they didn’t help her.
 

 
This was also convenient for the production team to give orders that would be accepted.
 

 
Her dog-like superior (the director) replied bluntly: [You are already a mature imperial assassin; you need to learn to unlock it yourself.]
 

 
Duan Ge tightened her grip on the gun handle expressionlessly.
 

 
There was a groove on the gun where one finger could be pressed down, but when she placed her finger there, it didn’t respond. Since this was support from that group, it would most likely require their fingerprints.
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [Why?]
 

 
The inner voice in her mind shifted from bland to suppressed, interrupting the rhythm of the audience's laughter.
 

 
Is the rabbit feeling wronged?
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [Why is it that their superiors even considered this? A bunch of useless people I wiped out are getting such good treatment?]
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [They all deserve to die!]
 

 
The rabbit was not wronged; the rabbit was furious.
 

 
The gun handle creaked under her grip, making a sound that was unsettling to hear.
 

 
Duan Ge suddenly stood up, deciding not to wait any longer. She wanted to quickly eliminate these pampered little useless individuals favored by a good leader, complete the mission, and get a pass from her superior to leave the city. Once she left Canaan City, she would figure out a way to get rid of her dog-like superior who was connected to her, and from then on, she would be free as a rabbit in the open sky.
 

 
...
 

 
In the filming backstage.
 

 
Director Chen pondered, "Is the dog-like superior she wants to eliminate talking about us?"
 

 
The deputy director replied, "It's just a dog-like superior; it should be you, Director."
 

 
Director Chen said, "I'll smoke a cigarette to calm my nerves."
 

 
Director Chen continued, "I'm not scared, really not scared. Just think about how great this program is for the effects! Tong Zhao's Weibo is also gaining followers; it's a good thing! At worst... at worst, we can wait for her to wake up and treat her to a nice meal!"
 

 
...
 

 
Led by Kong Yeming, the survivors moved away from the gas area and settled on the second floor of a residential building.
 

 
Since the four-person team was easily wiped out and only one of the eight was killed, Kong Yeming ultimately decided that five people would share one room, sleeping in the living room, while two single rooms would be occupied by the remaining three who would guard the hallway.
 

 
They would try to act collectively as much as possible.
 

 
Kong Yeming sternly emphasized, "Remember, if anything happens, wake up the others. We need to respond immediately as a group. From what happened before at school... at least he still fears large numbers.”
 

 
They were not standing there waiting to be slaughtered; they had a strong desire to survive.
 

 
Seeing such careful consideration, the audience couldn’t help but worry about Tong Zhao.
 

 
[If only there were guns.]
 

 
Although there were no guns, Duan Ge had obtained a batch of cold weapons, which was a significant upgrade from just carrying a dagger.
 

 
Now she had a telescope!
 

 
Searching for living people in a dead city was like everyone looking for grains of sand, searching for those moving points of life.
 

 
Kong Yeming was very cautious and did not venture out for the first two days, staying on the second floor and sharing the limited food with everyone. Even though they tried to ration their food, feeding fifteen mouths consumed a lot. After two days of stable living, they finally began organizing small teams to go out and search for resources on the third day.
 

 
Five people per team, divided into three teams for action.
 

 
They searched through one street after another, ensuring that if one team called for help, the other teams would be within earshot and could immediately provide support.
 

 
It was very well thought out.
 

 
While they huddled tightly at their base, Duan Ge still roamed the streets and alleys of The City every day, never feeling bored. The audience also preferred not to watch these people cowering in fear; it was too dull—much better to watch Tong Zhao!
 

 
It had to be said that Tong Zhao truly knew how to create engaging moments.
 

 
Duan Ge, who never took the conventional route, seemed to have endless energy as she leaped across rooftops and residential buildings. She even climbed the walls of tall structures, a faint smile gracing her lips, indicating that she was thoroughly enjoying herself. The wind blew her short hair, making her appear even more light and agile.
 

 
Fans simply couldn’t get enough.
 

 
With lively and cute children's music playing in the background, it was like watching a happy little bunny frolicking through a concrete forest.
 

 
Today, the bunny was also guarding the peace of The City!
 

 
Two days of silence couldn't wear down the patience of a professional assassin. When Kong Yeming and his group appeared within Duan Ge’s line of sight, the previously dull live stream instantly erupted with excitement—
 

 
[Bunny is charging for Mama!]
 

 
[I’ve been keeping the livestream open for the past two days; it feels like I’ve raised a desktop pet that can run and jump.]
 

 
[They’re all moving together. Does Bunny have any chance?]
 

 
……
 

 
Just when the mom fans were worried, Duan Ge, spotting the survivors on screen, broke into a smile.
 

 
In this variety show, she didn’t smile much.
 

 
Apart from the rare times when she enjoyed a hearty meal and her eyes crinkled with satisfaction, she mostly had a slight smile while parkouring alone, but it was very faint and not obvious. It merely allowed the audience to sense her relaxed demeanor, but it couldn’t be said that she was genuinely happy.
 

 
[The girl looks so cute when she smiles QAQ]
 

 
[I want to protect Bunny’s smile!]
 

 
Pampered by the mom fans, Duan Ge let out a light, low laugh filled with a hint of dark intensity: [I’m going to kill them all today!]
 

 
[……]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
What should we do if the little one is about to go on a killing spree? Waiting online, getting anxious.
 

 
Duan Ge selected a submachine gun, a handgun, and a rifle from the box to take with her, leaving the sniper rifle behind since she wouldn’t be able to use it for long-range since she couldn’t unlock it. She stuffed one gun into her backpack, filling it with as many magazines as she could carry; it felt heavy and satisfying.
 

 
The survivors were searching through a shopping mall.
 

 
Most of the store windows had been shattered, and there were no edible supplies left inside. However, items like jewelry and watches remained intact, though without specialized lighting, even expensive luxury goods lost their luster.
 

 
Seeing where they were searching improved Duan Ge’s mood even more.
 

 
The mall's complex layout was more suitable for her to showcase her skills.
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [So which of these three teams should I target?]
 

 
The mall had a large glass ceiling, providing excellent lighting during the day. If the midday sun was too harsh, the security would press a button backstage, causing a mechanism on the roof to pull up a layer of gauze to help diffuse the light.
 

 
In ordinary survival variety shows, it was a popular segment for contestants to “scavenge” in supermarkets and malls.
 

 
But the audience clearly preferred to watch from Tong Zhao's perspective.
 

 
They wanted to see how she would infiltrate the mall, outnumbered!
 

 
Duan Ge first went to the already deserted security room, where she found the mall’s floor plan. Searching through the security room often yielded useful information; most of the guards who were just getting paid wouldn’t pay attention to it and didn’t need to.
 

 
The entire city was without electricity, and the surveillance cameras were all in darkness.
 

 
Duan Ge studied for a while, first turning off all the lights in the mall, and then she found the switch for the mall's backup power supply—
 

 
[Can this even be done?]
 

 
[The little one is really capable!]
 

 
[No, this is beyond just being capable... How are you so familiar with this?]
 

 
Tong Zhao had become a mature assassin, learning how to infiltrate the mall on her own.
 

 
After a while, the ten or so surveillance screens surrounding Duan Ge lit up, clearly capturing the movements of all the survivors.
 

 
After all, it was backup power mainly used to supply emergency lighting and network access in the hallways, so it couldn't be used for long. Duan Ge calculated that it could only support an hour...
 

 
Duan Ge: [That’s enough.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I just need to see where they are.]
 

 
The survivors still didn't know they had not only been discovered but that every one of their movements was under the hunter's surveillance. She focused on one man and one woman from Team Sun; their shorter stature made them easier to control. It would be best to catch them both.
 

 
They moved systematically through the shops, skipping over stores that clearly had no use—such as clothing and bag shops—while targeting stores like Watsons for thorough searches.
 

 
The survivors hadn’t come away empty-handed that morning.
 

 
They had found a wrench in a hardware store and equipped each person with a kitchen knife from a market; at least they could pretend to be tough guys in Causeway Bay without any issues.
 

 
After observing the surveillance footage in the security room for a while, Duan Ge hid in a Watsons store.
 

 
[The little bunny is lurking!]
 

 
[Waiting for a bunny ambush.]
 

 
Once the perspective shifted to that of the hunter, the survival show suddenly felt much lighter.
 

 
For the group of survivors, however, this was undoubtedly a horror film.
 

 
Having searched in the mall for quite some time, the group gradually lowered their guard. He Su was the first to walk into the store: “We haven’t found anything; these people cleaned out the place before they fled.”
 

 
The snack area was completely empty.
 

 
As far as the eye could see, there were still unnecessary supplies like foundation and lipstick on the shelves.
 

 
The five of them didn’t give up, spreading out to search in the spacious store.
 

 
The female doctor spotted a large roll of toilet paper in the corner.
 

 
Duan Ge patiently waited in the staff room.
 

 
Someone would definitely come in looking for something, but the door was narrow, only allowing one person to pass at a time, maybe two at most if they squeezed close together.
 

 
She didn’t need to peek out to see; just from the sound of footsteps, she could tell how far away the person was. She needed to take control of this unlucky soul coming toward her in two seconds.
 

 
The footsteps grew closer.
 

 
He Su wanted to see if any supplies had been overlooked in the staff lounge.
 

 
As he opened the door, the audience’s hearts rose, their heartbeats quickening.
 

 
As He Su grasped the doorknob, he thought: “Could there be enemy troops inside?”
 

 
This sudden thought heightened his alertness as he prepared to quickly back out and shout for help if anything seemed off.
 

 
He pushed the door open forcefully.
 

 
However, the space behind the door was empty, unlike the scene he had imagined.
 

 
Only the audience watching the livestream knew that the slender Duan Ge was hiding behind the door, right in his blind spot.
 

 
He let out a sigh of relief.
 

 
He Su: "Ugh, I'm really such a coward."
 

 
With that thought, he took three steps inside.
 

 
At that moment, Duan Ge was already behind him.
 

 
Before He Su could sense anything, Duan Ge reached out and locked her arm around his neck while roughly slapping a piece of packing tape over his mouth, sticking it to his nose as well. This left him only able to make muffled sounds of "Mmm mmm mmm mmm!" — quieter than if she had just covered his mouth.
 

 
Uncertain about how long the unlocking would last, Duan Ge had no intention of suffocating him, fearing that if he died, his fingerprints would be useless.
 

 
She quickly tied He Su's hands behind his back with some rope and used his thumb to unlock all three guns. After unlocking, the pixel display above the small groove lit up, counting down... 1800, 1799, 1798...
 

 
Duan Ge: "Is this in seconds?"
 

 
She quickly calculated in her mind: it was half an hour, hovering on the ambiguous edge of being enough and not enough.
 

 
Duan Ge gently peeled back a corner of the tape to allow He Su to breathe, albeit barely.
 

 
As soon as he made contact with the air, he immediately began to gasp for breath, panicking to the point of forgetting to make a loud noise to call for help.
 

 
Duan Ge lowered her head and smiled. "Be good, and I’ll let you live for another half an hour."
 

 
He Su couldn’t understand her words and grew even more frightened.
 

 
The audience understood.
 

 
The content of the show had been so lighthearted over the past two days that they had almost forgotten what kind of killing machine she really was. They genuinely thought of her as a carefree, struggling little rabbit, parkouring around The City every day...
 

 
[Ugh, I've been A'd!]
 

 
[Cubs are so ruthless, mommy likes it, woo woo woo!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, kill me!]
 

 
Without showing a hint of her sharp teeth and claws, she had truly made the cheetah look like a rabbit.
 

 
Once he calmed his breathing, He Su was able to make out the appearance of the person in front of him in the dim light—
 

 
It was an exceptionally beautiful face.
 

 
Even when viewed from below at this deadly angle, it was still undeniably stunning.
 

 
Although it was highly inappropriate, He Su couldn't help but think: “So there are such beautiful girls among the enemy's lackeys?”
 

 
[Well, there goes my chance with a pretty girl.]
 

 
[But if you had a choice, would you rather be killed by a greasy middle-aged man or have your throat slit by a gorgeous and sexy lady?]
 

 
[...Such a persuasive argument!]
 

 
"He Su?"
 

 
Although the struggle between the two ended quickly, with Duan Ge successfully executing a unilateral ambush, some sounds inevitably emerged from the staff room. Her teammates called out loudly, as this guy was quite talkative, and just a single response would put them at ease.
 

 
From the depths of the room, a voice could be heard, but it was an unintelligible female voice.
 

 
The remaining four momentarily failed to react—
 

 
Then, a gunshot rang out, echoing throughout the entire store!
# Chapter74
What happened?
 

 
Lying on the ground with his hands tightly bound by a belt, He Su couldn't understand the situation outside. When he heard his companions' terrified screams, he crazily arched his body on the floor and kicked his legs wildly, trying to stop the crazy woman from her violent actions.
 

 
Just as he was about to kick Duan Ge, she effortlessly lifted her leg to evade the attack and then stomped down hard on his ankle. He had no idea where she was stepping, but she managed to immobilize his legs, her military boots mercilessly grinding against him.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Be quiet."
 

 
He Su didn't know what she was saying.
 

 
However, the violent glare she shot at him made him instinctively close his mouth tightly.
 

 
How terrifying...
 

 
He Su shivered.
 

 
Duan Ge's shooting was precise; in the blink of an eye, the number of survivors in the top right corner dropped from 15/20 to 11/20. The three people in the filming room awoke to see the equally astonished expressions of the staff...
 

 
Actually, people had rushed over upon hearing the commotion.
 

 
Duan Ge initially wanted to wait with her gun for a few of the less intelligent ones to walk into her line of fire. However, after being angrily reminded by Kong Yeming, no one dared to make a reckless move.
 

 
"Fine then…”
 

 
She softly muttered as she used strong packing tape to attach the machine gun's grip to a cardboard box, placing it under the cashier counter and slightly pushing it out. Anyone glancing in from outside the store would see the exposed gun muzzle.
 

 
“Sure enough, ambushes suit my style better, right?”
 

 
“And I’ve really wanted to try this trick…”
 

 
After taking down three enemies who had much better treatment than her, Duan Ge's mood improved. She smiled joyfully and chatted with the foreign survivor in a language he couldn't understand—he didn't understand, but he could see what this woman was planning.
 

 
Duan Ge picked up another gun and took a breathable, dust-proof black mask from her waist bag, putting it on and revealing only her cold, sharp eyes.
 

 
This wasn't to conceal her identity or to look cool.
 

 
It was just that there was quite a bit of dust in the ventilation ducts.
 

 
Duan Ge crawled from the ventilation duct to the women’s restroom on the same floor— a short distance, just adjacent. If it were any farther, she wouldn’t bother crawling. Not only would it be strenuous, but she would also likely end up in strange places, which weren't suitable for moving around.
 

 
……
 

 
Kong Yeming was very cautious. After hearing the gunfire, he stopped his companions from rushing in impulsively.
 

 
He suspected that his teammates were likely in grave danger. They couldn't fall into the enemy's trap and let the sacrifices increase: “Since they have firearms but haven't directly killed us, they probably aren’t as numerous as I imagined. If we all rush in together to attack, maybe some will get injured, but the chances of survival will be higher.”
 

 
“Rush in?” someone questioned.
 

 
“I’ll be the first to charge in,” Kong Yeming replied calmly. “We could also exit now and escape the mall, but I don’t think we’d get far. What do you all think?”
 

 
The group fell silent.
 

 
Someone quickly poked their head out to glance through the glass window and immediately spotted the dark muzzle of the machine gun, their heart tightening as they pulled their head back. “He’s still waiting for us! Shouldn’t we just run?”
 

 
Run?
 

 
The group exchanged glances, and no one dared to make a decision. They all turned to look at Kong Yeming in unison.
 

 
Kong Yeming sighed inwardly, realizing that his strategy of overwhelming numbers was no longer feasible—[These people are too likely to betray their teammates,] he thought.
 

 
[Kong Ge (brother ) is right.]
 

 
[Kong Ge understands people; I'm starting to like him. He performed the best in this show besides Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Why not just run away directly?]
 

 
The next moment, Kong Yeming’s inner voice answered the audience’s doubts: [The enemy’s goal is to wipe us out. We have a relationship of life and death. Previously, the enemy was hidden while we were in the open, but now that we finally know he’s in the Watsons store, we can’t miss this opportunity to take him out…]
 

 
Kong Yeming helplessly sighed, “Since you all want to run, then let’s run.”
 

 
One more day of life is better than none.
 

 
This answer obviously aligned more with the group’s expectations; after all, turning and fleeing didn’t require much courage.
 

 
However, just as they turned around, gunfire erupted—
 

 
Specifically coming out from the ventilation duct, Duan Ge had two reasons: one, she had a sudden impulse to make her entrance in the classic assassin style, and two, she was also on guard against what Kong Yeming had said about a group of eleven charging in at the same time.
 

 
To minimize risk, she had to catch them off guard.
 

 
Before everyone could react, she planned to take them all out!
 

 
All the escapees were focused on the muzzle of the gun in the Watsons store ahead, and they all felt a sense of retreat, thinking about how to avoid the enemy and that if they could escape, they should.
 

 
With this mindset, how could they possibly stand against Duan Ge?
 

 
“How did she appear behind us!?”
 

 
“Run!”
 

 
As gunfire rang out, some fled without a word, some reminded their “teammates,” and others pulled their teammates to use as shields against the bullets. Kong Yeming was hoarse, desperately trying to reorganize them, only to find it was futile.
 

 
The pressure Duan Ge exerted made them lose their courage to resist.
 

 
Except for Kong Yeming, whose fighting spirit was at 50, everyone else was below 20—while they weren’t scared to the point of begging for mercy and waiting to die on the spot, they also lacked the courage to fight her to the death. With every gunshot, someone in the filming chamber awakened in shock.
 

 
Not only were they unprepared, but the production team was also stunned.
 

 
The entire staff backstage fell into silence.
 

 
No one had anticipated this kind of situation.
 

 
Yes, Tong Zhao had previously performed excellently, her handgun skills were precise, but what was happening in this mall was on a completely different level. Who would have thought that she could kill everyone as if she were in a god mode! You could say she was like a berserker; she was seriously crawling through the ventilation ducts for infiltration. You could call her an assassin, but she was at most relying on surprise attacks, killing them all right in front of them.
 

 
After a brief moment of silence, the backstage erupted into a flurry of discussions—
 

 
“Damn, what’s going on? She’s taking them out one by one!”
 

 
“Quick, modify the data! Don’t let her finish them all!”
 

 
The data technician was nearly in tears: “What can I change to stop her? Besides, I think what I change isn’t as fast as her kills…”
 

 
All the staff turned to look at Director Chen, waiting for him to make a decision.
 

 
A cigarette slipped from Director Chen’s fingers and fell to the ground.
 

 
“Don’t worry about it,” he said.
 

 
“Don’t worry? Are you serious? But this is a huge mess!”
 

 
…
 

 
Director Chen raised his hand and pressed his forehead: “Because there’s only one survivor left alive, and everyone else has awakened.”
 

 
Ah, I see.
 

 
The filming backstage fell into another long silence, with only the voices of questions rising and falling in the filming chamber—seeing that almost everyone had awakened, the contestants thought it was a normal filming wrap-up, still puzzled that they didn’t feel the usual headache from the common instinctive reaction after long-duration variety shows.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao and He Su remained asleep in the cabin.
 

 
…
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t listen to stories and left no survivors.
 

 
After clearing the scene, she counted the number of bodies present, confirming that she had captured them all. She then diligently began to take off their watches: "I want to see what I can draw from this."
 

 
After removing the watches, Duan Ge remembered that she had left someone in the store.
 

 
He Su heard the outside noise transition from chaotic sounds to angry shouts, then to screams, and finally to silence…
 

 
He began to wish he was the one getting shot.
 

 
Not out of self-sacrifice, but because waiting for the big bad to return here was truly more torturous than death.
 

 
He Su felt his heart racing, almost ready to burst out of his chest.
 

 
[No sound? Could it be that they all got killed? How did she do it? Is she crazy? Help, I really hope she forgets about me and doesn’t come back to finish me off. But if she leaves me here, I won’t survive either…]
 

 
In his fear, all kinds of chaotic thoughts flooded his mind.
 

 
Then, he heard footsteps gradually approaching.
 

 
[He Su’s perspective really gives off a horror movie vibe.]
 

 
[Just a passerby, watching a survival variety show for the first time, how does one survive this?]
 

 
[Look at the title, “One Life Survivor,” that’s about Tong Zhao. Don’t you get it yet?]
 

 
[Wow, that’s a perfect essay right to the point.]
 

 
With tears in his eyes, He Su saw that slender figure.
 

 
She was splattered with blood, coming from a respectable opponent— the only one who dared to rush in and try to dodge her shots with agile movements, closing the distance to subdue her, Kong Yeming. This bloodied appearance made her seem even colder and more sinister, almost inhuman.
 

 
Like the Grim Reaper?
 

 
That description seemed too literary.
 

 
In any case, when He Su saw her, he couldn't help but think: "My dog at home looks like this when it sees the butcher."
 

 
All the audience focused on how Duan Ge would handle He Su.
 

 
He Su was still wondering: "Am I going to face the top ten tortures of the Qing Dynasty? No, please! Just give me a quick end!"
 

 
"You really didn’t need to be kept alive,"
 

 
Duan Ge scoffed with a tone of indignation, "Seems like all that good food didn’t improve you much."
 

 
The rabbit was not only brutal but also held a grudge.
 

 
He Su, considered somewhat handsome among the contestants and having survived to the end, made the audience draw comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, Duan Ge didn’t give them a chance to ship a new couple; she simply ended it all with a shot, took off his last watch, and hummed a little tune as she returned to the base.
 

 
A true total annihilation.
 

 
Like something out of a dream...
 

 
In traditional variety shows, guests often tone down their performance to continue filming, even if they are extremely talented, or they may build up their act gradually. But in survival variety shows, for Duan Ge, this was her real life—who would consider the show’s effect in a fight for survival? If you’re going to kill, do it quickly; anything that can be resolved in one day should never be dragged into the next!
 

 
How could they continue filming like this?
 

 
The staff exchanged glances, and half of them went to explain the situation to the awakened guests.
 

 
In order to stretch the episode’s runtime and because they had previously promised Tong Zhao's fans that the top ten on the fan leaderboard would have the chance to participate in a lottery for her, the show was not over yet; it had just turned into a "one-person variety show." In the real "One Life Survivor," after returning to the base, she redeemed a total of nineteen watches at once!
 

 
The results of the ten lottery draws were determined by the top ten wealthy fans on the leaderboard:
 

 
1. Unified Old Vinegar Pickled Beef Noodles
 
2. Hema Fresh Instant Food
 
3. Soup Master
 
4. Mediterranean Chicken Skewers (a box of 7 skewers)
 
5. A pack of marinated salmon
 
6. Lazy Instant Handcrafted Mini Lobsters
 
7. A shampoo and body wash set from a certain sponsor brand
 
8. A snack gift pack
 
9. Self-heating mini hot pot
 
10. Strawberry Milk-flavored Popsicle
 

 
...
 

 
After exchanging for a pile of miscellaneous items, Duan Ge sat cross-legged in front of a mountain of supplies, no longer as excited and anxious as she had been when she saw the cooked food before. She leisurely picked through the items, glancing at this one for a moment and touching that one, exuding the happiness of a hamster surrounded by a room full of sunflower seeds.
 

 
After all, having experienced the resource shortages of a post-apocalyptic world, Duan Ge had a deep obsession with food.
 

 
Even a bland and tasteless instant noodle cake would be thoroughly enjoyed by her.
 

 
In the end, Duan Ge chose a pack of marinated salmon, Mediterranean-style chicken skewers, and a self-heating hot pot. Once the mini hot pot was heated up, she tossed in the chicken balls, letting them roll around in the boiling, spicy red oil broth, which soon glistened with a layer of oil.
 

 
After eating and drinking her fill, she treated herself to a strawberry milk-flavored popsicle...
 

 
What a divine life this was!
 

 
Duan Ge: [Does this mean the dog boss is finally acting like a human?]
 

 
Hearing the little one’s confused thoughts, the fans were eager to jump up: [Absolutely not, it’s all about mom’s love!]
 

 
[The dog production team wouldn’t treat her like a person; only we are the solid support behind our little one.]
 

 
[I want to see Tong Zhao on a food variety show; she looks so cute when she eats seriously!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Never mind, none of these seem like normal supplies anyway...]
 

 
After finishing her meal, Duan Ge carefully packed up the remaining supplies and slung the ridiculously heavy backpack onto her back, heading toward the quarantine line outside of The City. She had completed her mission, her hands stained with blood, and the smell of gunpowder lingering on her palms.
 

 
As the sun set, it gradually draped the entire City in a layer of golden clouds.
 

 
Duan Ge walked down the deserted street, the setting sun casting a long, elongated shadow behind her, her slender figure contrasting amusingly with the heavy, oversized backpack.
 

 
The background music was Delara's "We Don't Run From Anyone."
 

 
Assassins fear nothing.
 

 
No matter who it is or how many people there are, Duan Ge will not shy away.
 

 
As her figure grew smaller in the distance, the scene gradually blurred, and the only clear words that remained were...
 

 
"One Life Survivor."
 

 
This time, the survivor is: Tong Zhao.
 

 
This time, the production team had no time to modify the data.
 

 
The wall Tong Zhao stood behind was so high that even a desperate dog couldn’t jump over it.
 

 
As the list of behind-the-scenes staff appeared, the audience finally realized... it was really over! Those who had come to enjoy the show left five-star reviews in the live stream, while seasoned variety show fans quickly noticed that this was clearly at least half shorter than the expected season duration. Ending it like this was likely a last resort...
 

 
What else could they film?
 

 
Would they just let Tong Zhao do an eating broadcast, filling the remaining half of the duration with that?
 

 
Throw the "dead" guests back in for a sequel titled "One Life Survivor: Twenty People Return from the Dead"? Please, that would be utterly humiliating; the audience would be furious, and no one would tolerate such nonsense. After weighing the pros and cons, Director Chen chose the path with the least loss, leaving this episode with a dignified conclusion and hoping for high quality—
 

 
As long as enough people watched, they could still break even.
 

 
Once they realized it was finished, some reluctant variety show fans and supporters didn’t exit; instead, they began chatting in the comments section, filling the screen with applause emojis for a while.
 

 
[It wasn't enough to watch; I want to see Tong Zhao continue filming!]
 

 
[Will Tong Zhao still participate in variety shows in the future?]
 

 
[What variety show would still dare to invite her? She would just take everyone out!/Dog head]
 

 
[Don’t be so petty; this is the production team underestimating her abilities. If it were a survival show on a deserted island, it might be much more interesting.]
 

 
[I’ve said it before: waiting for Sister Zhao to battle a T-Rex!]
 

 
The comments were so lively that even after the live broadcast of "One Life Survivor" ended, the discussion continued for a full two hours, overshadowing other serious 24-hour variety shows that were airing at the same time, leaving them frustrated and speechless.
 

 
So annoying.
 

 
……
 

 
When Duan Ge woke up in the holographic filming pod, she immediately relinquished her position to her primary persona.
 

 
The long-sleeping Tong Zhao opened her eyes, looking dazed, as if her soul had been scattered.
 

 
When she finally opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the chandelier on the ceiling and a circle of staff and fellow guests surrounding the pod.
 

 
It was like a combination of Tang Seng, Sha Seng, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie, all with the same "You’re awake!" expression.
 

 
Director Chen was delighted: “You’re awake!”
 

 
It was pure and perfectly aligned with reality.
 

 
Tong Zhao was even more confused.
 

 
Propping herself up with one hand on the bottom of the pod, she asked after her assistant sister helped remove the data cables connecting her forehead and temples, “What is everyone doing? Is this a collective viewing of my remains? I’m not dead, am I?”
 

 
“Puh! Don’t say such ominous things.”
 

 
The assistant used to be her fan.
 

 
After several episodes of "Cloud Raising the Rabbit," the fan's admiration had transformed into maternal love. Hearing Tong Zhao curse herself like that, she couldn’t help but disapprove and correct her. Tong Zhao was more accepting of the care that girls might overstep boundaries, so she obediently nodded and said, “Okay.”
 

 
Director Chen wore a sympathetic expression: "Let’s put it this way—she can’t possibly die even if everyone else does."
 

 
The other staff immediately showed expressions of discomfort, clearly feeling called out.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who hadn’t yet regained her memories, looked over: "Director, do you really want me to die?"
 

 
"No, no!"
 

 
Under her intense gaze, Director Chen quickly shook his head like a mouse that had its tail stepped on. "I wouldn’t dare! Um, actually, this is everyone waiting for you to join us for a celebration feast."
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled: "Even though I don’t have a headache, don’t you all need to rest this time?"
 

 
In the past, whenever filming a long-term survival variety show, they would always arrange a full day of rest after each awakening.
 

 
At this point, Director Chen sighed again: "No need to rest."
 

 
After all, it won’t take long.
 

 
The others died much earlier than her, and after a shower, they all said they were well-rested.
 

 
It didn’t matter that the others weren’t coming; this meal was mainly because he didn’t want to offend Tong Zhao and wanted to make a good impression before she regained her memories.
 

 
So Director Chen clearly explained to the others before arranging the celebration feast that those who didn’t want to come didn’t have to.
 

 
But how could the guests pass up the chance to get close to a variety show director?
 

 
Knowing that the celebration feast would be filmed in full for behind-the-scenes editing later, everyone became even more enthusiastic.
 

 
Even the amateur guests who weren’t pursuing fame but came to have fun immediately decided to attend the dinner when they learned they would have a chance to eat with Tong Zhao, even if they had to endure a headache.
 

 
With twenty guests and the staff behind the scenes, there had to be at least four large tables of food.
 

 
The production team was considerate in this regard. Noticing the weather forecast predicted no rain that evening, they set up the banquet by the lakeside, allowing everyone to enjoy the beautiful scenery while indulging in delicious food. After returning to her room to freshen up, Tong Zhao changed into casual attire for the event. Her table was filled with the main crew members, including the director, assistant director, and variety show screenwriters.
 

 
As soon as Tong Zhao appeared, there was a wave of cheers by the lakeside—
 

 
“The super assassin has arrived!”
 

 
“Super assassin? Isn’t it an empire?”
 

 
“Because she has killed more than eight people without dying even once, she’s a super assassin now.”
 

 
“Wow, that’s impressive!”
 

 
The crew of ‘One Life Survivor’ was relatively young, and they spoke so casually that it felt like a barrage of comments.
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t regained her memories from the variety show yet, but seeing this scene, she smiled slightly with a calm demeanor, as if everything was under her control. Her gaze fell on Director Chen, who immediately understood and stood up to pull out the chair next to him: “Come on, Sister Zhao, sit here.”
 

 
It felt a bit strange for her to be called "Sister Zhao" since she was younger, and it carried a hint of flattery.
 

 
"Sister Zhao" was a compromise between the two.
 

 
Before filming the variety show, the others looked at her with suspicion or disdain.
 

 
But after filming…
 

 
She silently observed the looks the others gave her and found only admiration.
 

 
A small number of the guests who had fallen early still looked at Tong Zhao with awe.
 

 
As Tong Zhao sat down, she asked the voice of Duan Ge in her mind: "What did you do to win these people over as your fans?"
 

 
Duan Ge replied, "I haven't remembered yet."
 

 
Concubine Chen was quite pleased that no one dared to look at her with lustful eyes anymore: "Isn't this only natural? Little Ge is just that outstanding."
 

 
Duan Ge smiled slightly: "You’re right."
 

 
By the lakeside, there was a long truck with a screen hanging from the cargo area.
 

 
The assistant director beside Tong Zhao explained that this was going to be used for projecting exciting clips from ‘One Life Survivor’ during the meal.
 

 
The variety show screenwriter looked a bit constipated: "Actually, it's just your solo performance, Sister Zhao."
 

 
"Really?" Tong Zhao asked, a bit curious.
 

 
”You'll know when you see it later."
 

 
The waitstaff quickly began serving the four large tables.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced over; the other tables were filled with beautifully presented home-cooked dishes.
 

 
But in front of her…
 

 
There were abalone, sea cucumbers, shark fins, and fish maw—nothing less than the most luxurious, with even more extravagance!
 

 
"Miss Tong, please move aside," a server said softly. Tong Zhao instinctively shifted to the side, and the plate in front of her was taken away, replaced by a large bowl of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall!
 

 
How big is it?
 

 
To be specific, after this bowl of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was placed down, she could no longer see the faces of the people sitting across from her.
 

 
It was uniquely set in front of her, and no one else had one.
 

 
The others looked completely normal, seemingly unaware that there was any problem at all.
# Chapter75
The waiter opened the lid and explained:
 

 
“Our Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is made using a more traditional method, going through thirty processes, twelve cooking techniques, and incorporating thirteen types of meat and seafood, bringing out its aroma and freshness with sea salt.”
 

 
As the lid was opened, a fragrant aroma filled the air.
 

 
Tong Zhao had no doubt that it truly involved thirty processes.
 

 
After all, sitting atop was half a large abalone soaking in golden broth. Since the ingredients were this lavish, the kitchen naturally would be willing to invest more effort to avoid wasting such expensive ingredients.
 

 
“Why not try it while it's hot?”
 

 
Director Chen kindly poured her a drink: “This wine is also quite good; it’s locally brewed fruit wine. You can have a taste, and if you don’t like it, just let them switch to juice or water.” He spoke in detail, as if afraid Tong Zhao might misunderstand and think he was forcing alcohol on her.
 

 
“Okay, thank you.”
 

 
The drinking glasses were small, and with the director being so courteous, Tong Zhao also gave him face and downed the drink.
 

 
Director Chen visibly relaxed.
 

 
The other staff members also looked at the director with approving eyes.
 

 
What can I say about this atmosphere?
 

 
It was like when a certain gang leader in "Young and Dangerous" poured tea and offered apologies to characters like Chen Haonan or Liang Kun; if he didn’t accept it, it would imply that someone might end up dead.
 

 
Tong Zhao considered herself a law-abiding good citizen with a fairly good temper,
 

 
But this is too much!
 

 
Abnormal behavior is suspicious. Could it be that they want something from her and are trying to butter her up first?
 

 
She quietly asked, “Is this Buddha Jumps Over the Wall only for me? Isn’t that inappropriate?”
 

 
“There’s nothing inappropriate about it; after all, you’re the winner,”
 

 
Director Chen smiled slightly and raised his voice to ask everyone, “Do you have any objections?”
 

 
The whole table shook their heads in unison, looking completely convinced.
 

 
“You see,”
 

 
Director Chen continued, “If you don’t believe me, I can ask the other tables…”
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped his puzzling behavior, wanting to say to eat quietly and not cause a scene, but then she noticed that everyone was sitting quietly without touching their chopsticks, all looking like they were waiting for her to start eating first.
 

 
[...Duan Ge, how many people have you gotten into trouble with this!]
 

 
Duan Ge had an innocent expression: [They used to wait for me to eat first in the camp; I got used to it.]
 

 
The “camp” here referred to the survival camp she had led in the apocalyptic realm, where everything revolved around her. Even couples who fought would hesitate to act without consulting her first. Later, when conditions improved and there was surplus food, babies were even born wanting to take her surname, asking her to name their children. The opposing forces criticized her for fostering a cult of personality during the apocalypse, but it didn’t stop many people from calling her the “faith in the ruins.” She just wanted to say, “Stop talking nonsense and get to work.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and picked up a piece of fish maw with her chopsticks, placing it on a bowl of white rice to eat.
 

 
Seeing this, the others finally felt relieved and began to eat along with her.
 

 
The flavor of the underworld was getting stronger and stronger; it wouldn’t surprise her if everyone started calling her “Boss” tomorrow. Tong Zhao silently ate for a while and noticed that the big screen began to play a highlights reel. As everyone's attention shifted to the screen, she quietly asked the director, “I’ll just ask directly, do you need my help with something?”
 

 
With her posture so low, it was either an apology or a request for assistance.
 

 
“Just say it plainly; whether it can be done is my business,” Tong Zhao made her words even more straightforward. Like Duan Ge, she didn’t like beating around the bush or playing guessing games, as it was a waste of time.
 

 
Director Chen showed a moment of surprise, then realized she had misunderstood.
 

 
“How could that be? If I had to say I’m asking you for a favor, it would just be to hope that Sister Zhao can cooperate in various ways during the subsequent promotions and help out with our little show.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, “Of course, as long as it’s not excessive, I will cooperate. Whether I can attend will depend on the specific schedule.”
 

 
Director Chen sighed inwardly; she was right to be popular. From her performances in the variety show, one could see that she had a strong sense of responsibility and an aggressive personality. In person, she was polite and pragmatic. Even though this variety show was like a runaway horse, he still wanted to collaborate with Tong Zhao again…
 

 
Forget it; it was pointless to think about it.
 

 
Of course, he wanted to work with her, but the question was whether he was worthy. He couldn’t even get a meeting.
 

 
“To achieve the desired effect and balance during the show, we’ve been making things difficult for you backstage. We didn’t want you to misunderstand after regaining your memory, thinking we invited you just to target you. So we’ve prepared good food and drink for you; consider it compensation from all of us staff for Sister Zhao.”
 

 
Tong Zhao understood.
 

 
She thought to herself, Sister Zhao isn’t such a petty person…
 

 
Wait, why was she even calling herself “Sister” now!
 

 
Han Zhi: [Hahaha, it’s a bit cute that Sister Zhao is calling herself that.]
 

 
Duan Ge was curious: [I want to see how they’re making things difficult for me.]
 

 
The big screen quickly fulfilled Duan Ge’s wish.
 

 
The footage showed her first lottery draw, pulling out three packs of Master Kong instant noodles labeled "Breakfast," "Lunch," and "Dinner." The director zoomed in, giving her a close-up of her dumbfounded expression.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Hahahaha!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [That’s not too bad; instant noodles were quite common food back in my time, just with low nutritional value.]
 

 
Just as she said it was fine, the next moment, she saw that the instant noodles didn’t have any seasoning packets.
 

 
Duan Ge: [……]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Was that on purpose?]
 

 
Tong Zhao asked Director Chen if this was part of the show’s effect.
 

 
Unexpectedly, the modeler chimed in: “It wasn’t on purpose. When I was writing this segment of code, my cat jumped up and randomly pressed a bunch of keys, and when I deleted the mess, I accidentally deleted a portion that included the seasoning packet code.”
 

 
He showed Tong Zhao the screensaver on his phone, which was a golden gradient fat cat: “This stupid cat is the culprit; it owes Sister Zhao an apology!”
 

 
The cat was just too cute, so Tong Zhao had no choice but to forgive it.
 

 
The remaining exciting clips were pretty standard, mostly showing Duan Ge rampaging and ambushing others. No wonder everyone looked at her with both respect and fear—it's the subconscious effect of variety shows. Even though she herself didn’t seem that fierce, she was still quite intimidating. Some who had already regained their memories were even more afraid of her, like mice seeing a cat, feeling a deep sense of trepidation.
 

 
Later, getting shot in the mall wasn’t too impactful; it was all just headshots.
 

 
The leader of the Cloud Squad, the Thunder Night Watcher, and He Su had practically developed "Fear of Zhao Syndrome."
 

 
Not only did they insist on sitting far away, but they also occasionally glanced over with concerned looks.
 

 
It was too obvious; Tong Zhao found it hard to ignore them.
 

 
Fortunately, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was quite delicious. She poured a generous spoonful of broth over her white rice, so fresh that she forgot about the gazes of those three little cowards.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was a special version made just for her, the quality of the food on the other tables was also decent. Overall, everyone seemed to enjoy the meal, chatting enthusiastically about the entertainment programs—there were quite a few nearby establishments in the film city, including KTV, Werewolf, and script-killing games.
 

 
Director Chen invited her to go to KTV together.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that since she didn’t know anyone in the production team and hadn’t made new friends during the variety show, there was no need to join in the festivities. It would be better to head back to her room to rest and chat with her agent about any new developments during the filming… so she politely declined Director Chen’s invitation: “You all have fun; I want to rest.”
 

 
This time, Director Chen didn’t insist but kindly reminded her that the villa area in the film city offered SPA massage services, and members involved in the variety show could enjoy a half-price discount.
 

 
Tong Zhao was tempted.
 

 
She left a message for her agent, saying she was going for a spa massage and that if Sister Chu needed her, she could call. She could listen while getting the massage. Sister Chu replied with a “Okay, I’ll wait a moment; I’m currently dealing with another artist being caught making out with their assistant.”
 

 
Making out made Tong Zhao laugh: [Is it that serious? Will it be made public? Looks like the only way to bury this news is for me to make out with my assistant too!]
 

 
Her assistant was a girl with a round face, who was also one of her fans.
 

 
Sister Chu replied with a string of frantic gibberish.
 

 
Director Chen’s recommendation was spot on; the SPA services in the film city were very professional, and the service attitude was great. After Tong Zhao explained that she just wanted to rest and didn’t need any conversation, there were no unnecessary words throughout the session. As the therapist began to apply essential oil to Tong Zhao’s back, her phone rang.
 

 
Already prepared, Tong Zhao put on her Bluetooth headset and listened to Sister Chu update her on the latest situation.
 

 
The main point was about the National Studies Martial Arts Hall.
 

 
Sister Chu: “That’s a legitimate big shot. Not only does he hold a high status in the entertainment industry, but he also has considerable influence in politics.” She listed a long string of titles, which sounded dazzling and impressive: “In recent years, he’s taken a liking to young people surfing the internet.”
 

 
Got it, in short, he really appreciated Duan Ge.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “What should I do about that? Are there any dinner parties I can attend?”
 

 
At this, Sister Chu drew in a sharp breath: “Shi Dingjun has invited you to audition for his ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ If you succeed, you should be able to meet the old man… Shi Dingjun is his senior apprentice.”
 

 
“Ah?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had some impression of this director, but it wasn’t very deep.
 

 
After all, he wasn’t the kind of person like Shi Qianqiu, who was always making sensational remarks to the media; the media loved to interview Shi Qianqiu because he always had explosive, candid comments. Director Shi, on the other hand, was a very stable and down-to-earth type. He usually only spoke publicly at formal events, and even if reporters caught him off-guard, they could only get very formal responses.
 

 
As for other matters…
 

 
In any case, no one is interested in the romantic life of a serious middle-aged artist. Director Shi has been married for many years, and at most, there might be a few lines written about his infertility news. However, he has said that his wife has health issues and doesn’t plan to have children; the couple supports each other and plans to live out the next life together. Some audacious reporter provocatively asked, “Doesn’t Director Shi think it’s a pity not to leave any offspring in the world after a hundred years?”
 

 
Shi Dingjun wasn’t angry; he said, “I’ve left behind many great films.”
 

 
Then he smiled slightly:
 

 
“Compared to my ‘bloodline’... ahem, I’m not tall enough at 175 cm, I developed myopia at an early age, and I usually have some issues during annual health checks. I’m not a handsome man; I wouldn’t say my genes are very exceptional. But I can confidently guarantee that every one of my films is an excellent work.”
 

 
This response clearly distinguished him from the reporter.
 

 
Of course, it also put him in a different league compared to Shi Qianqiu, who is famous for being child-free. Tong Zhao had seen reporters ask him the same question. At first, he ignored it, saying he didn’t want to respond to personal matters, but after being pressed, he eventually answered:
 

 
“Alright, then satisfy my desire to be a dad; just call me ‘Dad’ first.”
 

 
The young reporter fell silent.
 

 
Digressing, let’s bring it back.
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled Director Shi Dingjun’s representative works, which were mostly male-centric stories featuring tough men in hard confrontations. During last year’s China Anniversary Celebration, he was invited to shoot a special on martial arts: “The Knives of the Maiden,’ listening to that name, is it about women disguising as men?”
 

 
“Correct, I’m inviting you to audition for the female lead,” Sister Chu said with a hint of pride, “Now you only need to consider the female lead position.”
 

 
“Alright.”
 

 
Although Tong Zhao chooses her own projects, sometimes a good director and a big production can outweigh personal preferences.
 

 
She was quite realistic about this.
 

 
If she wanted to take on heavyweight projects and reap the rewards that the industry focuses on, she didn’t want to hold the title of the box office queen for only half a year; she wanted to stay on the throne indefinitely.
 

 
“Alright, let’s move on to the next topic.”
 

 
Turning the page.
 

 
Next was the previously mentioned, jumpy and accusatory, subpar screenwriter who criticized her for her lack of unique subconscious themes. After the broadcast of "One Life Survivor," he was mocked so much that he turned off comments on his Weibo and went silent. Sister Chu was very indignant: “How can this irrelevant person comment on how diverse our Zhao Zhao’s subconscious is? What does it have to do with him? Isn’t he just jealous that ‘Heartless Tribulation’ exploded in popularity? He should be cursing Shi Qianqiu instead; what does it matter to attack the actors? He deserves the backlash.”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh at that.
 

 
Sister Chu was getting anxious: “Don’t laugh! So many people are waiting to see how good or bad your temper is!”
 

 
Concubine Chen agreed: “Zhao Zhao, your manager is right. When I first entered the palace, some nameless minion provoked me, and the other concubines remained silent, waiting to see my temperament. If you don’t show these kinds of people a lesson, they will just keep going.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was taken aback.
 

 
Show them a lesson? She wasn’t a gang leader.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Alright, I’ll think of a way.”
 

 
For now, she would just get through it.
 

 
“I won’t laugh, I won’t laugh,” Tong Zhao asked, “Is there anything else?”
 

 
That settled it.
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Tong Zhao fully immersed herself back into the massage.
 

 
The hands of the technician were magical; after a while, she fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already completely dark outside. She dragged her relaxed body back to the small villa to continue sleeping, and she slept soundly until the next morning, waking up to meditate, go for a morning run, and take a shower in one go.
 

 
After that, it was no longer her concern; Sister Chu told her to stay home and carefully choose a script.
 

 
The audition for "The Knives of the Maiden" was next week, and before that, she could look at other options.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to pick a gentler script.
 

 
After all, Duan Ge was too ruthless. Originally, she was a beautiful star, and once the edited version of "One Life Survivor" was released, she was afraid she would become widely known, so she needed to balance things out.
 

 
Hey, hey...
 

 
Zhao Zai squeezed half of his head out from the door with the security chain: "Sister, I want to come out and play too."
 

 
He could squeeze his head out, which showed that Tong Zhao’s mental strength had significantly improved after filming the survival variety show.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "You should be good to go after filming one more instinct movie."
 

 
Upon hearing this, Zhao Zai's eyes brightened, and he obediently responded, "Then I'll wait for you, sister."
 

 
Seeing Zhao Zai made Tong Zhao feel quite complex.
 

 
Because it was her younger self, she often wondered... was she really that silly when she was young?
 

 
Her thoughts couldn’t escape the notice of the other personalities, and Zhao Zai puffed up like a little pufferfish: "I'm not silly!"
 

 
Zhao Zai shrank back, sulking.
 

 
[Ah.]
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, the round little head got stuck.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Pfft."
 

 
Empress Chen: "Hahaha..."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Pet the little Zhao."
 

 
In the end, it was Han Zhi who helped push Zhao Zai's half head back in. The little loli's eyes filled with tears, looking aggrieved and withdrawn.
 

 
...
 

 
The edited version of "One Life Survivor" was about to be broadcast.
 

 
The people who would watch the 24-hour livestream were mostly hardcore variety show fans, Tong Zhao's core supporters, and a portion of those with too much free time. The general public mostly waited for the edited version to come out, followed by an official promotion before they would truly engage with the show.
 

 
Promotion was still very important.
 

 
Without promotion, no matter how popular it was, it would only spread in a small circle.
 

 
Many people entered the live stream room, saw the survivors just hanging around waiting to die, and lost interest. It was boring.
 

 
Only the edited version would be worth watching.
 

 
Tong Zhao promised to promote it well, but first, she had to attend the Li Zhi TV gala, which was the most important matter at hand.
 

 
At the gala, she would sing a duet of a traditional love song with Song Wanzhuo—
 

 
Empress Chen made her entrance in a water-red dance dress, playing the guzheng. What a “disobedient” empress, skillfully enticing the audience and the camera. The empress didn’t make overt flirty gestures; rather, every glance, every smile, and every movement exuded charm and allure.
 

 
Not only was the audience thrilled for her, but the director also particularly adored her.
 

 
If it weren't for his rationality, the director would have wanted to give the camera to her entirely.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo?
 

 
It was like the courtiers who had once been enchanted by the empress's beauty, completely forgetting the emperor's presence. When they finally came to their senses, the feudal mindset of having served their whole lives under a hierarchy of lords and subjects was stirred for the first time—why weren’t they the rulers? Only His Majesty deserved to possess such beauty!
 

 
Empress Chen didn’t play the entire time; she only had a solo on the guzheng in the middle.
 

 
She played while Song Wanzhuo sang.
 

 
Once that segment was over, she stood up and began to dance while singing.
 

 
The empress stood on a high platform, her long hair styled in an intricate updo adorned with gold ornaments. Some of it was fake hair, not all of it tied up; her long hair flowed behind her like black seaweed. As she spun lightly, the ends of her hair created a captivating arc… Even the audience seated in the back row felt far away from her, yet they seemed to have truly caught a whiff of her hair's fragrance, showing expressions of intoxication.
 

 
The silk draped over her hands swayed as she danced, the gauze adorned with tiny sequins, resembling a stream of flowing light that made it hard for anyone to look away.
 

 
The live audience and the viewers online were all ordinary men, so it was normal for them to have weak self-control.
 

 
However, upon closer observation, the audience members who weren't mesmerized noticed...
 

 
Even Song Wanzhuo, who was supposed to interact with the camera, was totally focused on Tong Zhao!
 

 
His gaze was glued to her, unmoving, with a tipsy smile lingering at the corners of his mouth.
 

 
Seeing this scene, the agent felt like his heart had died and was filled with frustration—having already been outshined by her and stolen the spotlight, how could he be so careless too? Once the performance ended and they were backstage, the agent pulled him aside and asked, "My Wanzhuo, what were you smiling about? You were staring at her the whole time; it was so obvious!"
 

 
"I know,"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo momentarily felt guilty and showed a reluctant expression. "Ah, you don’t understand. You’re too far away. When I was in that position, I could smell her sweet fragrance every time she made a big movement."
 

 
"…"
 

 
The agent looked at his expression and thought he didn’t seem to have just smelled her fragrance.
 

 
He looked as if he had been bewitched, seriously affected.
 

 
That night, a reporter indeed asked him. The question was subtle; the reporter mentioned that there were many comments in the live stream about him constantly looking at Tong Zhao. Was that true?
 

 
Song Wanzhuo cleared his throat and explained seriously, "That’s because everyone watching us collaborate just wants to reminisce about ‘Ming Emperor’. When I was singing, my mindset shifted to that of the Ming Emperor; it was the Ming Emperor who wanted to see the empress, not me."
 

 
Reporter: ???
 

 
We totally believe you!
 

 
On Tong Zhao’s side, things were much more normal. Just as she was waiting for a reporter to ask her if she would consider acting in a palace drama, she said, "Everyone has too fixed an impression of me. You can check out my upcoming show, ‘One Life Survivor’, where you’ll see a different side of me, and it’s quite charming."
 

 
[Zhao Zhao's advertising seems a bit stiff, but she’s pretty, so I forgive her.]
 

 
[Wow, that’s a hard sell!]
 

 
There were also some clueless onlookers: [How different can it be? But I really want to see such a delicate and beautiful ancient-style beauty~]
# Chapter76
The gala is a battleground fiercely contested by TV stations.
 

 
Each station is gearing up to compete for ratings, preparing meticulously during the buildup, with a shining list of preview programs rolling by alongside the names of stars and celebrities, accompanied by lively and intense music, aiming to leave a memorable impression on viewers so they tune in at the right time.
 

 
Higher ratings mean that advertising slots can be sold at even higher prices.
 

 
Riding the tailwind of the recent airing of "Heartless Tribulation," Tong Zhao is still the most impressive female star this season, and many people are looking forward to her appearance in historical costume. When the audience learned that she would attend the Li Zhi TV gala in traditional attire, many became interested and switched to Li Zhi TV, eager to relive the essence of the Mu Xian Chang.
 

 
Instead of seeing the proud plum blossom against the snowy mountains, they were greeted with a vibrant and blooming begonia.
 

 
The audience was immediately stunned.
 

 
Then, as soon as Tong Zhao started to sing, they could no longer bear to change the channel.
 

 
Her voice was genuinely enchanting; when she sang ancient-style love songs, it was especially captivating.
 

 
Tong Zhao resembled a beautiful courtesan used to singing melodious verses for the emperor, each syllable teasingly dancing like fingertips painted with rouge against the chest, leaving the audience feeling a delightful tingling sensation. Could viewers experience such imperial-level enjoyment on other channels?
 

 
No, it was unique—no one wanted to change the channel!
 

 
Many viewers watched the gala like this—constantly flipping channels, glancing at this show and that, until they became entranced by one program, while more often than not, no program could hold their attention. Aside from the segments featuring their idols, they merely skimmed through everything else, as if they had seen it all and yet had seen nothing at all.
 

 
However, with a single note and a charming smile, Tong Zhao captivated the attention of this group of fickle admirers.
 

 
[Help, this isn't the Mu Xian Chang I wanted to see.]
 

 
[But it's so engaging! Can that guy next to her just let her shine? Let my wife be the only beauty.]
 

 
[Don’t pull her down; their relationship is really good.]
 

 
[The immersion is strong; when Zhao Zhao smiles at me, I feel like I'm the emperor!]
 

 
As a result, the ratings for the Li Zhi TV gala skyrocketed.
 

 
It surged in a unique way, with particularly high retention rates during their duet.
 

 
The number of comments mentioning Tong Zhao far exceeded those for Song Wanzhuo, highlighting the stark contrast between the strong female lead and the weaker male counterpart, which was a bit lamentable.
 

 
This data couldn’t be hidden. When the gala supervisor at Li Zhi TV saw this—
 

 
Wow, Little Sister Zhao is definitely going to demand a higher price next year.
 

 
They should really pat themselves on the back for having the foresight to invite her this time; the only regret is not placing her in the prime time slot. It was aired too early; if it had been during peak viewing hours, she would have surely overshadowed the competition on other channels!
 

 
When analyzing the profits, the industry’s eyes became incredibly sharp. People began to murmur about how Tong Zhao is explosive in everything she does. Could she really be the so-called "Ziweixing" of the entertainment industry? After making a splash in a drama with a high-end supporting role, her movies keep getting hotter, and the variety show "Sea King Kill" has attracted significant attention. Now she’s taking the stage at the gala… great, she’s outshining everyone!
 

 
The benefits brought by Tong Zhao were too obvious.
 

 
A simple and brutal logic chain was deeply etched in the minds of the executives of various TV stations and brands—
 

 
The audience loves watching Tong Zhao, and Tong Zhao has a lot of buzz. Whatever she shoots becomes a hit—
 

 
No matter how much she charges, booking her is a guaranteed profit!
 

 
In the undercurrents, her worth has risen another level—
 

 
This status will hold until her next stumble.
 

 
The industry is now focused on the edited version of "One Life Survivor," which will air tomorrow. Coincidentally, aside from needing to purchase viewing rights for the holographic version online, the exclusive broadcast rights for the traditional version belong to Li Zhi TV, indicating that the station has a good relationship with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Is this Tong Zhao achieving new heights in the variety show realm, or is it a repeat of a failure?
 

 
The backstage staff of "One Life Survivor" were moved to see her advertising their show at the gala and went wild, enthusiastically supporting her in their WeChat group.
 

 
What does it mean to be dedicated? This is what dedication looks like!
 

 
After the gala, during Tong Zhao's short holiday, she lounged at home with nothing to do, flipping through scripts every day and watching with her other personalities, checking if there was something she wanted to perform, especially the female reporter. She had been awake for so long and hadn’t appeared yet.
 

 
Han Zhi: “Shu Yi is suitable for more nuanced, serious dramas, but they often get good reviews without box office success.”
 

 
The female reporter’s name is Shen Shu Yi.
 

 
The mission of the female reporter is to deliver three valuable news articles. The first is about the sentiments of a smaller nation caught between two warring superpowers, promoting anti-war sentiments. The second is about the East's indiscriminate whaling and the need for environmental protection. The last one focuses on the female soldiers who have been overlooked in history during wartime, reporting on their sacrifices and struggles in defending the homeland, highlighting that their sacrifices are equally heroic and detailing the hardships faced during their campaigns.
 

 
This can be considered a more meaningful and profound world that Tong Zhao has experienced.
 

 
Female Reporter: "The film I made might not sell well; it’s too dark. Let Zhao Zhao develop further."
 

 
She said softly.
 

 
At that time, Shu Yi submitted her first news article, which moved many people and contributed significantly to the systematic recognition of the two countries' ceasefire. However, she inevitably fell into a depression, which worsened over time until she completed her mission, temporarily sealing away the memories of this world to recuperate.
 

 
The more she confronted the vast amounts of pain, the more she felt her own insignificance.
 

 
So sometimes she would forget her own name, becoming a tool for documenting the suffering of others.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted her: "It’s okay; it’s not like you have to use box office sales to pay rent. Just relax and stay in my mind."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Let’s take a look at other scripts."
 

 
Just as she was flipping open the next one, Tong Zhao received a voice message from the Ze Shan WeChat group.
 

 
This group is incredible; every day there are tons of messages, half work and half fun. Tong Zhao was puzzled about how they managed to find the information they wanted from it. In any case, as long as it didn't hinder their work, she let them be. Any important updates would be sent to her privately, and she would occasionally check in to see what they were chatting about, which usually revolved around eating, drinking, and having fun.
 

 
Sometimes Tong Zhao would doubt that this group gathered the most hedonistic people in the city.
 

 
What was this voice message about?
 

 
As soon as she clicked in, her friends noticed her profile picture had appeared and immediately cheerfully called out to her: "Sister Zhao, Boss Wei is organizing a movie screening! Are you coming?"
 

 
"A movie screening? What are we watching?" she asked, even more confused.
 

 
For this group of people, a movie screening was far too subdued.
 

 
Racing dirt bikes in an off-road vehicle park suited their style much better, especially if it could be done in a rainstorm during a typhoon, giving off that melodramatic feel reminiscent of "Thunderstorm."
 

 
"'One Life Survivor' is airing tomorrow, right? Let’s watch it together!"
 

 
"……"
 

 
They seemed quite enthusiastic.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Okay. Send me the address. Is it still at Wei's place?"
 

 
"Yes, yes, yes."
 

 
"Sister Zhao has to come!"
 

 
"Does this count as a large figurine that can talk and walk…"
 

 
"Tonight, we’re all fans of Sister Zhao!"
 

 
The voice messages were particularly lively.
 

 
Though they said it would be at Wei's, the address had changed.
 

 
Another second-generation girl said they wanted to have a barbecue by the beach this time, so they switched to a mansion under the Wei family that had a private beach.
 

 
This group of friends became Tong Zhao’s true companions after her return. No matter how childish their invitations were, as long as she could spare the time, she would attend. She promptly scheduled an appointment on her calendar; no other activity invitation mattered.
 

 
It was only when she was playing with them that Tong Zhao truly felt she was living among people.
 

 
The movie screening ultimately turned into a semi-swimwear party.
 

 
The men wore swim trunks and the women wore bikinis. Tong Zhao, following the local customs, wore a swimsuit, but she still had the most fabric on among the attendees.
 

 
From the front, she appeared in a snow-white lace-trimmed dress with a sheer camisole and a short skirt, while the back featured several straps tied into a bow. She looked ethereal and cute, perfectly matching her fresh and charming appearance.
 

 
This movie screening didn't have any parents present. The second-generation crowd brought their girlfriends along, all of whom were little stars that Tong Zhao couldn’t name. When she nodded at them, they displayed expressions of being flattered and starstruck, which felt even more rewarding than receiving a kiss from a rich boyfriend.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that her time in the industry wasn’t very long, but among her contemporaries and newcomers, she was seen as a star of destiny.
 

 
It was impossible to secretly ride her coattails.
 

 
If you offended Sister Zhao and this group of second-generation kids, you wouldn't gain any popularity and would likely end up getting sidelined. A hard-won wealthy boyfriend might even ditch you.
 

 
So at least they could share some good fortune!
 

 
Then Tong Zhao noticed that there was a professional chef helping the young ladies and gentlemen with the barbecue. These beautiful girls personally grilled chicken wings and beef tongue and brought them to Tong Zhao. They also had the inside scoop that she would be coming today, so they prepared some small cakes in advance.
 

 
To be honest, the food was quite tasty...
 

 
The girls’ affection and kindness felt genuine; there were no malicious palace intrigue tricks involved.
 

 
Thanks to their enthusiasm, Tong Zhao's mouth was constantly busy. She found it curious: “Why are you only grilling for me?”
 

 
Lu Shao was one of the second-generation kids, looking at his Sister Zhao with a pitiful expression.
 

 
The second-generation kids she associated with didn’t disrespect girls; even the small-time influencers who sought to benefit from their relationships were no different.
 

 
The young lady seemed a bit shy: “I have an audition next week and want to ride on Sister Zhao’s good luck.”
 

 
“Me too!”
 

 
“If it weren't impolite, I would have wanted to bow to Sister Zhao.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
So, it turns out that these chicken wings and small cakes are offerings.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and took her hand, intertwining their fingers as she said, “Come on, I’ll share some good luck with you.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was joking, but the other girls clearly took it seriously. They eagerly wanted to hold her hand, and it wasn’t until all the girls had held her hand that it was over. After soaking up the good luck, they were taken away by their boyfriends to play beach volleyball. Tong Zhao didn’t want to get in the water, so she applied sunscreen and lay down under a sun umbrella, enjoying the food grilled by the beautiful young ladies.
 

 
Wei Zekai plopped down next to her, fuming, “They shouldn’t have brought their girlfriends!”
 

 
“I think they’re all pretty normal girls. Why didn’t I know you were misandrist?” Tong Zhao wondered.
 

 
“I’m not misandrist. Why would I be?!”
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow in confusion, revealing his true thoughts: “They were surrounding you just now, and I couldn’t squeeze in.”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned over in her lounge chair and smiled at him: “Do you also want to ride on my good luck? No way; your luck is already one in a billion. Wanting even more good fortune would be greedy.”
 

 
“They grilled so much food for you; you must be full now. I was going to grill some for you too.”
 

 
It was clear that Young Master Wei had a distorted view of his own position.
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled Wei Zekai's cooking skills during "Sea King Kill" and thought that being full wasn't necessarily a bad thing. She chuckled and ruffled his gray hair. He had been so busy with venture capital that he hadn’t had time to play around, but he had still managed to get a stylish gray hairstyle, calling it “turning gray overnight for the company.” “I’m full, but you’re not, right?”
 

 
Wei Zekai replied, “I’m just filled with anger.”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked, “Then you can’t eat what I grilled?”
 

 
Wei Zekai smirked, “All of a sudden, I can.”
 

 
Young Master Wei's principles were as fragile as paper, bending at the slightest breeze.
 

 
Tong Zhao got up from her lounge chair. She was too lazy to grill anything that took a long time, so she just tore open a bag of Rocky Mountain marshmallows, threaded them onto sticks, and slowly roasted them over the grill. She was a pro at roasting marshmallows, perfectly controlling the heat so that the inside melted into a gooey mess while the outside had a dry, sweet crust, reminiscent of a candy skin. It was easy to pinch with two fingers, giving the marshmallow a "striptease."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at her with disdain, “That looks really sweet.”
 

 
“Eat it or don’t.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pinched out a perfectly roasted marshmallow and shoved it into his mouth. He immediately opened up like a little sea lion being fed, obediently taking a bite.
 

 
The roasted marshmallow tasted even sweeter and was sticky. It quickly stuck to Young Master Wei's mouth, who was usually full of talk and chatter.
 

 
The group playing volleyball on the beach turned to witness this scene, with a little influencer gasping and covering her face, “Is Wei Zekai really dating Sister Zhao? I won't tell anyone! But it's kind of sweet.” Her words were laced with envy.
 

 
Second Generation A: “Huh? Dating?”
 

 
Second Generation B: “Do you think they look like a couple?”
 

 
Just then, Tong Zhao finished roasting another stick of marshmallows to “refill” him.
 

 
Both the feeder and the fed were quite skilled, taking turns to eat one marshmallow at a time.
 

 
Second Generation C asked, “What should we call this? The joys of family?”
 

 
Second Generation D chimed in, “The Queen and her dog?”
 

 
The group of second-generation kids responded in unison, “Wow, that’s spot on!”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The pretty girls didn’t quite understand the thought processes of these second-generation kids.
 

 
After finishing their volleyball game, everyone took showers in the luxurious mansion and comfortably lounged in the screening room, munching on popcorn and enjoying their sugary drinks while waiting for the show to start. The opening featured a segment that gave off a strong cyber-game vibe, and many of the casual viewers drawn in by Tong Zhao were instantly confused:
 

 
[Is this an apocalypse movie? It doesn’t seem suitable for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Anyone who says it’s not suitable for Tong Zhao clearly hasn’t seen “Countdown 72 Hours.”]
 

 
[Friends from the Li Zhi TV gala, give me a thumbs up! I’m your organization!]
 

 
The comments flooded the screen, all asking about Tong Zhao.
 

 
She hadn’t even appeared yet, but her presence was already overwhelming.
 

 
Next, Tong Zhao made her entrance. The editing showcased a scene of her stepping out from crumbling ruins, her pale, well-defined legs hidden within military boots, which accentuated their elegant shape. The camera panned upwards, and some quick-thinking audience members turned off the comments to avoid being overwhelmed by a flood of compliments that would obscure Tong Zhao’s beauty.
 

 
She really looked stunning.
 

 
In the darkness, Tong Zhao felt many pairs of eyes turning to look at her: “What are you looking at? Watch the show!”
 

 
“It’s obvious that she looks beautiful on camera, but she’s even more stunning in person.” One of the internet celebrity girls spoke with a slightly downcast tone, but it was a heartfelt compliment.
 

 
How can anyone else live when she’s this beautiful?
 

 
She really does seem to come with a beauty filter built in.
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded in agreement, “Absolutely.”
 

 
“You're all praising me like I’ve paid you to do so.”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt helpless as Wei Zekai leaned closer, and she lightly tapped his head.
 

 
The production team initially thought the popularity gained from the Li Zhi TV gala would be fleeting, especially since the contrast in her image was so stark. People were expecting a glamorous and enchanting queen, only to find a cold, ruthless assassin instead. The audience demographics were completely different.
 

 
However, according to the backstage data, these viewers hadn’t left.
 

 
They continued watching.
 

 
The staff couldn’t quite grasp that these viewers were not merely fans of glamorous beauties; they were senior members of the “appearance association,” and all beings were equal. Yet this equality was exclusive to good-looking people.
 

 
The edited version had a brisk pace. It started with the Sun Squad searching for supplies in a McDonald’s, then hinted that the Cloud Squad was about to arrive. After establishing the physical positions of the two teams, the camera immediately zoomed in on Tong Zhao from a high angle.
 

 
Just the scene where she cut her long hair sparked a flurry of excited comments:
 

 
[So cool!]
 

 
[Sister, your short hair looks great too! Consider going this route next time?]
 

 
[I’ll never ask to see Tong Zhao in ancient costumes again; let’s have some workplace dramas! I want to see short-haired Zhao!]
 

 
Tong Zhao's first parkour segment was accompanied by the background music “Sold Out.” She navigated through high-rise buildings, cutting out unnecessary shots, with a quick and uplifting rhythm that stirred the audience's emotions. The powerful beat accompanied each difficult combination of moves, reaching a small climax as she leapt between two buildings.
 

 
What a fantastic visual treat!
 

 
No wonder they say Tong Zhao is a star who brings the excitement with her.
 

 
Who can perform such moves in instinctive variety shows? Who can? No one in the industry would dare claim they could, and Tong Zhao didn’t boast about her abilities in advance either. She effortlessly showcased a classic segment, as simple as picking up chopsticks.
 

 
There are already comments saying Tong Zhao's escape scene could be accompanied by “Hit and Run.”
 

 
Viewers who hadn't paid attention to the live broadcast were like explorers discovering a new continent. They eagerly spread the word on Weibo, in their friend circles, and on any social platform they could reach, practically bursting to tell everyone they had found a treasure of a star, especially among male viewers:
 

 
[Yooooooo! So cool!]
 

 
[Have you ever seen a female star in domestic entertainment who can parkour? Her core strength is insane.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, YYDS (forever a legend)!]
 

 
Some male viewers weren’t as sleazy as the stereotypes suggest; sometimes they were quite innocent. Seeing an enormous, moving robot excited them, and now seeing Tong Zhao filled them with the same thrill. She was just too cool, and they felt they had to share their excitement with friends to calm down.
 

 
At this moment, her companions all turned to look at her at once.
 

 
Their eyes were filled with the expectation of “Can you show us that?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...No, I can't.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Now that you want to see me parkour, when you see me fight four opponents later, do you want me to show off then too?”
 

 
Just then, the big screen displayed Tong Zhao lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.
 

 
As the Sun Squad escaped and the Cloud Squad was about to chase after them, the screen paused for a moment, surrounded by a red glow.
 

 
“Warning: High Energy Ahead!”
 

 
“Summoning Barrage for Protection!”
 

 
“Friends who are scared, put up your defenses on the screen!”
 

 
Next came the scene where Tong Zhao fought four opponents, shocking the unprepared ordinary viewers to the core.
 

 
[Is this even real??????]
 

 
[Holy crap, this feels crazier than a movie! How is her performance even more intense than Feng Yanqi's?]
 

 
[The key is that she doesn’t seem nervous or afraid at all. I suspect she has high-functioning antisocial personality traits.]
 

 
Director Chen knew that the highlight of the entire variety show was Tong Zhao. Whenever she performed, he put all his efforts into editing. Take this segment of her fighting four opponents as an example: the original footage might have been less than three minutes long, but they held a two-hour high-intensity meeting to brainstorm. Almost every shot was examined carefully to figure out how to make it perfect.
 

 
Their hard work paid off; the released segment indeed had an exceptional effect.
 

 
Not only were Tong Zhao's combat intentions clearly conveyed, but she was also filmed beautifully, rivaling serious action movies.
 

 
Professionals look at the technique, while amateurs look at the effect.
 

 
Just this one segment could hold the attention of shocked viewers for at least fifteen minutes—this is how the film and television industry works. Content must be meticulously crafted; otherwise, why would viewers choose to spend their precious time watching it? Programs that attempt to deceive the audience will be abandoned, and the opposite is true as well.
 

 
These fifteen minutes showcased the clashes of the other two teams, and just when the program estimated the audience's patience was about to run out, it immediately threw Tong Zhao into the spotlight to captivate the viewers.
 

 
As Tong Zhao exchanged three bags of Master Kong instant noodles, the noodles still lacking seasoning packets, the comments on the screen erupted with laughter, sounding like pig squeals.
 

 
Quick-fingered netizens quickly posted on Weibo, sharing meme templates:
 

 
[Tong Zhao looking dumbfounded.jpg], [Are you serious.jpg], and [Tong Zhao looking humble.jpg] were all too useful. Some viewers used these adorable emojis to lure newcomers into the fandom, spreading like a viral sensation. This time, the viewing threshold was lower than during the 24-hour live stream, leading to a rapid increase in the number of new viewers on Weibo.
 

 
As they poured in, the show had just reached the part where the Sun Squad and Thunder Squad returned to McDonald's, only to find a battlefield littered with corpses.
 

 
A huge special effects banner floated across the screen:
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Carefully Crafted Work~~~~”
 

 
Ah, this.
 

 
Where’s the promised cute and silly girl?
 

 
This is way too brutal!
 

 
An interesting discussion thread appeared on a certain entertainment forum: “Is Tong Zhao Really Silly and Cute?”
 

 
A user on the first floor concluded the thread: [Newcomers who fell for Tong Zhao's supposed silliness are the most naive…]
 

 
The guests began a serious round of deduction, giving the audience a big sense of intellectual superiority. Watching film and television works is sometimes thrilling precisely because of the god's perspective, allowing viewers to point and comment on the characters in the show.
 

 
At that moment, the camera zoomed up to the edge of the rooftop of a tall building.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat at the edge of the rooftop, gently swinging her legs—
 

 
[Tong Zhao seems like an elf that has descended to Earth.]
 

 
[An elf that can kill an entire family?]
 

 
[Well, when she’s not making a move, she’s still very obedient.]
 

 
This episode abruptly ended when she spotted the Thunder and Sun squads.
 

 
As the screen went black, the audience, who had been discussing the variety show, suddenly erupted in disappointment, all exclaiming that they hadn’t had enough. "What happened next? There’s nothing more?! We have to wait until the day after tomorrow? We don’t want to wait!"
 

 
A small portion rushed to watch the 24-hour recorded version, but most decided to wait for the second episode in two days.
 

 
In any case, this variety show was definitely going to be followed!
 

 
The production team had no money to buy trending searches, so they could only do their best to edit the original footage into something more exciting and appealing. Fortunately, they delivered a high-quality product, and Tong Zhao also contributed to the corresponding buzz—three related topics suddenly appeared on the trending list, each one featuring her name prominently. Savvy netizens noted that this show not only featured individual survival but also relied on her to carry the ratings.
 

 
What everyone was most curious about was where Tong Zhao acquired so many bizarre skills.
 

 
If you say she can sing and play instruments?
 

 
That’s normal; Tong Zhao comes from a good family, even if she encountered a bad father and a mistress.
 

 
If you say she knows martial arts?
 

 
Well… that could be somewhat acceptable. It’s part of traditional culture, good for health, nothing to be embarrassed about.
 

 
But what Tong Zhao clearly knows is the art of killing!
 

 
Who could develop such skills without training in a special forces camp for several years? The key lies in her mindset during that one-against-four situation—most people simply don’t possess that. Even those in special professions don’t have it. Moreover, due to her family's involvement in the gray market and their dark lineage, there are already discussions on Zhihu about her identity as a daughter of the underworld…
 

 
The level of discussion was astonishingly high, so her manager, Sister Chu, suggested that she consider responding.
 

 
Recollections?
 

 
That meant she needed to come up with an excuse to brush it off…
 

 
She couldn’t just say she practiced by killing zombies, could she?
 

 
Duan Ge: “Actually, I’ve killed people too.”
 

 
In the apocalypse, in order to protect certain vulnerable female characters, her hands were stained with blood. Sometimes, Duan Ge would feel that some living people were scarier than zombies.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Stop, I don’t really want to recall that.”
 

 
After thinking for a moment, Tong Zhao decided to go live on Bilibili, which the company had registered for her—her first stream in ages.
 

 
It was a gaming livestream.
# Chapter77
After adjusting the camera, Tong Zhao posted a message on Weibo:
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
Streaming for a bit. [Bilibili stream link]
 

 
[Is Sis doing a live stream? Why not on Weibo?]
 

 
[Feels like the dimension wall has been broken...]
 

 
[Zhao's become a mature streamer, already knows how to promote herself!]
 

 
The first episode of ‘One Life Survivor’ had just aired, and the audience was left wanting more. A bunch of "variety show refugees" were venting their excitement on Weibo, forums, Zhihu, and their social media feeds. Many were even leaving confessions under her previous Weibo posts. In short, there were plenty of netizens lurking under her posts, and when a new one popped up, they excitedly rushed to comment in the first row.
 

 
But refreshing it? Well, no chance of being in the first row now.
 

 
With one refresh, thousands of comments had already flooded in!
 

 
Following the link Tong Zhao provided, fans clicked into the stream, expecting to be visually stunned by her beauty. However, they found that her face only took up a small corner of the screen, about the size of a palm in the bottom right. Tong Zhao was sitting in a pink bunny-themed gaming chair, her hair tied loosely in a bun. Her pair of beautiful almond-shaped eyes weren’t looking at the camera but at something ahead—likely her computer screen.
 

 
She was very focused.
 

 
No distracted smiles for the audience, nor any seductive glances like at the gala.
 

 
Yet even without filters, her well-defined features easily outshone a whole district of female streamers.
 

 
She's too beautiful, making people sigh in awe. No wonder she's a celebrity; she's on a completely different level from internet influencers. When on the same platform, it feels like she's effortlessly outshining them. However, this dominance isn't as noticeable on Bilibili, where many viewers are fans of virtual streamers, which has led to memes like "[VTB Simps Are Among Us.jpg]".
 

 
“Ah, it’s all set,” she said.
 

 
As soon as she spoke, the screen of Tong Zhao's computer appeared in the livestream.
 

 
It was a game.
 

 
Specifically, ‘PUBG’, which is popular worldwide. The male character on-screen looked quite flashy, wearing a leopard-print face scarf and a Leather Hoodie jacket—clearly an expensive outfit. Tong Zhao not only plays games but plays them well. Part of it is due to often playing with Wei Zekai in the past, but another part is her natural talent.
 

 
In many ways, Tong Zhao is a bit of a polymath.
 

 
Otherwise, how could she repeatedly succeed in clearing different worlds in the fast-travel genre?
 

 
Even though she plays well, Tong Zhao rarely spends money on in-game purchases. This outfit was part of a “team uniform” that Wei Zekai had bought for their group. The black-clad look was just his style, exuding an air of wealth. He’s the type of person who, in ‘CS:GO’, would wield a brand-new blue-flamed karambit knife paired with a dragon-themed sniper rifle, flaunting his financial prowess.
 

 
Fans and viewers were stunned.
 

 
What was happening?
 

 
Tong Zhao streaming a game? And it's ‘PUBG’?
 

 
The information overload left the audience a bit overwhelmed.
 

 
Tong Zhao started a match right away and casually chatted with viewers during the loading time: "I saw a lot of people discussing why my instinctive shooting skills seem so good, and why I stay so calm. I figured I'd show you all in action and clear up the confusion."
 

 
After she explained, the viewers were even more puzzled.
 

 
The chat was flooded with questions:
 

 
[Zhao Zhao, what does playing games have to do with instinctive shooting skills?]
 
[Sis, are you trying to say you honed your shooting skills from playing PUBG?]
 
[I don't believe it! There's no way this theory is true! The forum pros can't be right!]
 

 
The so-called bragging from forums like Tieba and Zhihu, if all of it were true, China would have unified the world by now. Some overconfident kids talk big on forums, citing their achievements in shooting games, fantasizing that if they were on a real battlefield, they'd definitely dominate.
 

 
Of course, that's impossible.
 

 
In reality, the recoil from a real gun would be enough to humble these kids who can barely lift a grocery bag.
 

 
The live-streaming site Tong Zhao picked was well-suited for this kind of crowd. The viewers in the comments were savvy and started playing along with the jokes.
 

 
[Everyone shut up! You can't compare everyone's physical ability the same way. Zhao Zhao once took on eleven strong men by herself in a fit of extreme rage.]
 
[So what? I became her fan the day she slid tackled a tiger to death. That move was legendary.]
 
[Totally normal. Do you know why American soldiers are so tough? They train by playing PUBG on Steam with pro gamers. Their coordination comes from playing ‘Human: Fall Flat’, and their strategic backstabbing from ‘Fall Guys’.]
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the chat and was amused.
 

 
When she smiled, the slight upward curve of her eyes gave off an unconscious hint of allure.
 

 
Whoa.
 

 
Beauty attack!
 

 
Viewers started begging for the camera feed to be enlarged, asking if the mods could zoom in on her face.
 

 
But that wasn’t happening—Tong Zhao was seriously focused on streaming her game.
 

 
“Hello? Hello? Is the random teammate a guy or a girl?”
 
“Damn, it’s hilarious that we have to fill our squad with randoms because Nan Nan bailed last minute.”
 

 
"He’s talking nonsense again, probably watching a virtual streamer."
 

 
From just these few words, it was clear that the three random teammates had originally intended to play as a four-person squad, but one of them bailed last minute, leaving a spot open for Tong Zhao to fill.
 

 
Upon hearing the male voice in the game, her fans in the livestream immediately felt a mix of excitement and jealousy.
 

 
Playing a game with Tong Zhao?!
 
What kind of godly luck was that? Incredible.
 

 
Many comments were saying that if they could duo with Tong Zhao, they’d pay any amount of money for it.
 

 
“I accidentally queued into a four-player squad…”
 

 
Tong Zhao said, “You don’t need to spend money to play with me. If you get matched with me, we’ll play together.”
 

 
But the reality is, who’s going to get matched with her?
 

 
With her current level of fame, she could indeed make such a statement—after all, if playing with her had a price tag, that would be more like a paid companion, which would feel beneath her. Fans may joke about paying to play, but deep down they wanted their idol to be priceless.
 

 
Meanwhile, the three male players, unaware that they were the target of thousands of people's envy, kept joking around: “How could we be so lucky to get a girl on our team? A girl solo-queuing in a four-player squad? Not having a protector is just unscientific!”
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t turned on her in-game mic, only speaking to the viewers: “I accidentally queued for a squad game, so I’ll just play solo for now. I’ll only talk if communication becomes necessary.”
 

 
After a brief pause, she added:
 

 
“I haven’t played much this season, so the difficulty of the match will be lower. I won’t need to talk.”
 

 
As long as one member of the team survives until the end, the whole squad wins.
 

 
“Why won’t you need to talk?”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled lightly and said casually, “Because I play pretty well.”
 

 
The viewers at that moment had no idea that this game was about to redefine what “playing pretty well” meant…
 

 
The flight path was from the airport to the upper city. While on the plane, Tong Zhao quietly listened to her three teammates chatting via voice.
 

 
Player 2 was giving instructions: “Let’s head to Novo to scavenge. There won’t be many people up there since the flight path is away from it. We’ll loot and see what happens next.”
 

 
The other two responded with a chorus of "yeah, yeah."
 

 
Tong Zhao, wanting to engage with her fans a bit, asked the viewers in the chat where they’d like to see her jump.
 

 
Compared to other celebrities, she didn’t interact with her fans as frequently, which inadvertently helped her maintain a higher profile. Still, she genuinely liked and valued her fans. Handshake events weren’t her style, but she tried to make the most of opportunities to interact with them.
 

 
The chat asked her to jump at the airport.
 

 
She chuckled softly, “Alright.”
 

 
Her soft, feminine voice, transmitted through top-tier sound equipment, caressed the ears of all the viewers.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao was jumping into the high-risk airport area without saying a word or communicating with the team, Player 2 started complaining: “Another silent player jumping into the airport to get killed. Looks like we’re going to have to sneak through the zone to survive again, just to scrape some points. Playing as three with a random is too tough… Next game, we’re definitely pulling Nan Nan back in.”
 

 
The fans were in disbelief—how could they diss their goddess like that?!
 

 
Confused comments flooded the chat, but Tong Zhao calmly replied, “No need for question marks, they’re fine. I’m the one who didn’t turn on my mic. I just wanted to chat with you all first.”
 

 
Indeed, if you got matched with a random player who didn’t communicate, you’d feel annoyed too.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s words soothed both the PUBG players and her biased fans.
 

 
No one could stay mad after that—Tong Zhao had just said she wanted to chat with them!
 

 
Because of the rich resources, if the airport is along the flight path, players typically face around 30 to 40 opponents upon landing. However, with a recent update reducing the loot at the airport, fewer people jumped there, though there were still three to four teams, about 20 players in total.
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao’s parachute landed on the tech building, and she began searching for equipment.
 

 
Surprisingly, she didn’t encounter an entire squad inside. Instead, she came across a lone player on the second floor who had been separated from his team. She quickly picked up an UMP9 and took him out with ease, then jokingly commented, “Why is there only one? Where are his teammates? Give me some action!”
 

 
As soon as she made her first move, the viewers could tell she knew how to play.
 

 
Many curious onlookers, who came just for the spectacle, began to wonder how well this actress could really play.
 

 
“The players in this match seem like noobs. Their aim doesn’t seem great. Looks like it’s a beginners’ match,” Tong Zhao said calmly, her tone carrying a soft, amused smile.
 

 
It was as if she wasn’t in a deadly battlefield, but rather playing a peaceful idle game.
 

 
Some fans who didn’t understand the game were utterly charmed by how she called them "little kids."
 

 
Gunshots continued to ring out nearby. When Tong Zhao arrived at the scene, she couldn’t see anyone and muttered in confusion, “It’s like they’re just shooting for fun. When I need someone, there’s no one around.”
 

 
No sooner had she said this than she was shot in the back.
 

 
Before the audience could react, Tong Zhao had already swiftly turned, found cover behind a door, and quickly eliminated the ambusher with a few shots. Though her health had dropped significantly, she remained unhurried: “Now his teammates will come. What should we do?”
 

 
She calmly closed the door and started healing by a window without finishing off the downed player.
 

 
The chat exploded with viewers urging her to finish off the enemy first, because in the game, downed players don’t die instantly if their teammates are still alive.
 

 
At this point, if the ambusher's teammates rushed over and killed Tong Zhao, they could still revive the injured player.
 

 
It's common sense to finish off an enemy after downing them.
 

 
Of course, healing takes time, and using medicine when injured is normal.
 

 
However, she interrupted her healing just after starting, without waiting for it to complete.
 

 
After performing this series of seemingly confusing actions to regular viewers and low-ranked players, she explained:
 

 
"When this ambusher dies, there’s a death cam that allows his teammates to see how he was killed. In that replay, they can also see my actions... If his teammates see me healing, what would they think?"
 

 
"They’d probably tell their team, 'She’s low on health! She's healing near my loot box! Hurry up and kill her to revive me!' ... Something like that."
 

 
"I timed it right. I jumped out the window just after their death cam ended."
 

 
"To these three teammates, I probably look like some clueless newbie still healing next to the body."
 

 
Just as she finished speaking, the sound of hurried footsteps grew louder.
 

 
"Look, they took the bait."
 

 
Tong Zhao quickly vaulted out the window, tossing a grenade back into the room. It blew up the first enemy who had jumped in from the adjacent room—let's call him Gourd Baby #1. Gourd Baby #2 then rushed in to try and revive him, while Gourd Baby #3 waited by the door, only to be stealthily taken out by Tong Zhao as she sneaked up using the shift key to move quietly. Inside, Gourd Baby #2 was desperately trying to revive his teammate…
 

 
Just two more seconds, and he’d have revived his ally, turning the fight into a 2v1!
 

 
However, what awaited Gourd Baby #2 was a grenade that had been cooking for two seconds.
 

 
Boom!
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled at the whole situation, "Classic Gourd Babies rescuing their grandpa."
 

 
In this 1v4, aside from her precise and swift takedown of the initial ambusher, Tong Zhao didn’t display any particularly impressive gunplay.
 

 
In higher-level games, good aim is expected. What really makes the difference is tactical movement, positioning, use of throwables, and strategy. The skill level of her opponents in this match was relatively low, and Tong Zhao had perfectly predicted their moves, securing each kill with ease.
 

 
Everything happened in the blink of an eye.
 

 
"See, as long as you stay calm, a 1v4 is no big deal," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Her three teammates couldn’t see her impressive moves. All they noticed was her health bar dropping significantly. Player 2 started grumbling, "As expected, another one who won’t make it out of the airport. Doesn’t have the skills but still won’t follow commands..."
 

 
But then, three knockdown notifications popped up.
 

 
The same player who didn’t follow orders and supposedly lacked skill had just wiped out an entire squad.
 

 
Player 3 responded, "Uh, what?"
 

 
"Uh... got lucky, huh? Didn’t see that coming," Player 2 awkwardly laughed, quickly shifting the topic, "Alright, let’s keep looting!"
 

 
The live chat exploded with laughter at this turn of events, with viewers mocking the players for failing to recognize a pro in their midst.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was calmly healing in a safe spot. Her backpack, aside from essential ammo, was filled with medical supplies and throwables. "I’ve gathered enough resources. Let’s go check on what our little friends are up to," she said.
 

 
The chat immediately switched from laughing to begging for attention, with many fans saying they wished Tong Zhao would call them "little friends."
 

 
For once, Tong Zhao indulged them, smiling as she said, "Alright, you’re all my little friends."
 

 
…
 

 
Compared to the cool and collected pro, her three teammates were much more down-to-earth.
 

 
Viewers listened as they cautiously looted, with Player 4 stuck debating, "Should I take the thumb grip or the vertical grip?" This indecision was too much for Player 2, the self-appointed leader, who sighed, "Whatever, I’ll go watch the bridge. Hurry up and decide!”
 

 
At the bridge...
 

 
Tong Zhao drove straight there.
 

 
Player 2 had likely been ambushed near the bridge. In the voice chat, he shouted, "There’s someone here! I couldn’t hold them off! I’m down, I’m behind cover… Ah," realizing that his teammates were still far away, he added in a dejected tone, "Never mind, I’m done for. I can see the enemy coming to finish me off. You guys won’t make it in time."
 

 
The enemy approaching to finish him off was already very close.
 

 
Ten steps away.
 

 
Five steps…
 

 
Just at the critical moment, a gunshot rang out, followed by the sound of a bullet hitting its target. Player 2 noticed he hadn’t lost any more health.
 

 
The one who got knocked down wasn’t him—it was the enemy who had come to finish him!
 

 
"Whoa, who shot him? Did another team show up?"
 

 
Player 2, who had narrowly escaped death, was overjoyed.
 

 
But then he realized that if another team had arrived, they’d likely be after him too.
 

 
Before he could finish speaking, the sound of a throwable landing next to him echoed in his ears.
 

 
It wasn’t a grenade.
 

 
With a ‘whoosh’, a cloud of smoke spread, like the light of an angel enveloping him.
 

 
It was a smoke grenade, meant to protect him and obscure the enemy’s vision!
 

 
Player 2 quickly opened the minimap and saw that the silent teammate wasn’t dead after all, and had actually come to save him!
 

 
Player 2 exclaimed, "A living saint has descended right next to me??"
 

 
Now that they had regrouped, it was time to open comms.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned on her team mic and, at the same time, switched on a voice changer. Her usual feminine voice became a soft, gentle male tone: "There are enemies at the bridge. I’ve already knocked one. You focus on reviving your teammate. I’ll handle the rest.”
 

 
As Players 3 and 4 rushed over to save him, Player 2 secretly asked his roommate in the dormitory, "Whoa, this guy is killing it so hard. He’s not using aimbot or anything, is he? What if he suddenly teleports to my face and asks me if I want to buy hacks? Or should we team up and ambush him? I want to be the one who takes down the hacker! I won’t give in for just a few points!”
 

 
Before his roommate could answer, Tong Zhao asked, “Aren’t you leaving yet? The poison is coming, and there are meds and bags on the ground. If you need more, just take them.”
 

 
Player 2’s eyes lit up as he activated his mic, “Oh, I’m coming right now!!!”
 

 
After healing himself, he jogged over to Tong Zhao and asked, “Big brother, you’re not selling hacks, are you?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao was speechless: “Have you ever seen a hacker share their meds, not kill you, and still let you play?”
 

 
“I haven’t, I haven’t! I was wrong, big brother.”
 

 
“It’s fine, let’s go.”
 

 
Player 2 thought about it; usually, he was the one calling the shots and leading the team. How could he be so easily summoned and directed by her? This feeling of being a follower…
 

 
It felt too good.
 

 
The three of them followed this boss around excitedly, killing anyone they encountered as they walked.
 

 
Mostly, Tong Zhao was the one killing; they were just there to move.
 

 
She was killing so quickly that her teammates hardly had a chance to show off their skills.
 

 
Player 2 was the highest-skilled among them, and after finally taking down a lone enemy, he shouted, “Look, look! I killed one trying to escape!”
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, the icon indicating that the boss had eliminated a squad appeared in the top right corner.
 

 
…Okay.
 

 
Players 3 and 4 were mainly providing heavy fire to pretend to be strong.
 

 
Player 3 asked, “Mr. Chen, did you hit him?”
 

 
Player 4: “I didn’t hit him.”
 

 
Player 3: “Me neither. What do we do if we can’t hit him?”
 

 
“Are you stupid? Just shoot the ground next to the tree; he won’t dare to show his head.”
 

 
“Oh, right, right!”
 

 
During their playful banter, as the frontline opened up, the enemy who didn’t dare to show himself was precisely taken out by Tong Zhao, who had flanked him.
 

 
With the boss leading the way, they pretended to aim in the final circle, having a blast and racking up points.
 

 
Another joyful day of earning points!
 

 
The audience, who had been watching the entire time, was completely won over by her.
 

 
If she had been playing solo, it wouldn’t have had the same effect.
 

 
The key was those three clueless teammates, which gave the viewers a strong sense of immersion, as if even they were teaming up with the boss to earn points.
 

 
Usually, Tong Zhao was somewhat reserved and didn’t have a very loud image.
 

 
She would say what needed to be said, not a chatterbox, but also not too talkative.
 

 
It might also be because there were too many talkative people around her, like Shi Qianqiu and Wei Zekai, who could carry a group chat on their own, which made her seem more efficient and concise. But fans noticed that Tong Zhao actually loved to talk and was quite interesting when she did.
 

 
The live chat was filled with a sea of gifts.
 

 
After the first episode of "One Life Survivor" ended, the variety show fans flooded into her livestream, creating a strong buzz. They soon discovered she was streaming a shooting game, which hit the excitement point for many male viewers—what could be more thrilling than playing a game with a goddess who was also highly skilled?
 

 
Female gamers felt proud as well. Who says women can only be cute and helpless?
 

 
Thinking about it this way, they genuinely started promoting her.
 

 
“Thank you all for the gifts and for becoming captains and admirals,”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t lack for popularity or gifts; she was just explaining it to herself: “In any case, my shooting skills and mindset are honed in games. I know most people can’t do it, so don’t try to learn from me. After all…”
 

 
She curved the corner of her lips, tinted with a sugary hue: “People’s physiques can’t be generalized.”
 

 
Wow.
 

 
This mixture of truth and humor made the audience find her even more enigmatic.
 

 
But a superstar needs a bit of mystery to be appealing. Following a star is about the chase; if you can grasp it and see through it, then it’s no longer a star. It’s just a meteor that fell to Earth, dragged into a lab by astronomers for study.
 

 
It’s only when it’s floating in space that it’s called a star.
 

 
Only those who are worthy of admiration and pursuit can be called celebrities.
 

 
[Alright, you’re right, sis, we’ll listen to you.]
 

 
[I’m afraid to get shot if I don’t listen/dog emoji]
 

 
[I believe it, but can Sister Zhao stream for a bit longer? I was recommended here by a friend halfway through and just caught the final circle. I want to see Sister Zhao play from the beginning!]
 

 
The chat was filled with pleas for Tong Zhao to keep streaming; one round just wasn’t enough.
 

 
To be fair, Tong Zhao made it to the end in this round, and the duration wasn’t short, but the audience still wanted more.
 

 
“Okay, let’s play another round.”
 

 
“By the way, I’m not just practicing my mindset in *PUBG*; I have other games I can stream as well.”
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her Steam account.
 

 
Wow, she had so many games that they were almost endless.
 

 
This was also thanks to Wei Zekai. It wasn't that Tong Zhao asked him to buy games for her, but rather that this heavily addicted, fleeting enthusiasm-driven teenager wanted to play every time a new game came out. Not wanting to be lonely, he wanted to invite his friends to join him, so anyone on his Steam friends list frequently received gifts.
 

 
After finishing another round of ‘PUBG’, Tong Zhao also streamed games like ‘Bridge Building’, ‘Landlord’, and ‘League of Legends’.
 

 
Fans went from being shocked and bombarding the chat with question marks to accepting reality, and finally to numbly spamming [66666]...
 

 
Ah, their goddess's versatility was just that simple and mundane, yet somehow dry.
 

 
After Tong Zhao ended her stream, bored onlookers began to comment on the stars within the industry who enjoyed playing games.
 

 
After counting, they found quite a few.
 

 
After all, with the rise of esports in recent years and its entry into the public eye, celebrities playing the same games as fans highlighted their down-to-earth quality. If they played well, they could attract fans, and if they were bad at the game but still addicted, it had its own charm.
 

 
[...Wait, are you all really accepting that Tong Zhao's shooting skills and mindset were honed in games?]
 

 
[But she’s just so strong!]
 

 
[We’ve already accepted this narrative.]
 

 
Some content creators were responsible for compiling the best plays from well-known streamers each week, and thus, one bizarre clip got mixed in:
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Airport Bloodbath: Locking Down a Team”
 

 
Not only was the highlight reel impressive, but she also coordinated perfectly with the three random players in her first match.
 

 
If they hadn’t been a last-minute match, one would think they were intentionally cast actors.
 

 
Afterward, when those three male college students found out that the incredibly strong player they had teamed up with that day was Tong Zhao, they were stunned for several days and immediately changed their dorm group name to “The Three Handsome Guys Who Played With Tong Zhao,” earning the envy of everyone in school.
 

 
The irony was that the girl the first male student was pursuing was a die-hard fan of Tong Zhao. She felt a strong sense of identification with him, even wishing she could become a boy just to be a fanboy. When she found out about this, her heart was filled with jealousy, and she said she never wanted to see him again, fearing she wouldn't be able to control her jealousy and might end up hitting him...
 

 
It was unfair!
 

 
This situation would have ended there. Tong Zhao couldn’t possibly stream games all the time, but then a scandal broke out involving the promotion of a training app in which she had invested alongside Zeshan. The app's originally planned spokesperson was embroiled in a violent scandal involving shoving his girlfriend while dating someone else.
 

 
Although it hadn't reached the point of being banned, it would definitely have an impact.
 

 
If the money was refunded, the promotion of the app could be delayed.
 

 
Tong Zhao directly posted in the WeChat group:
 

 
[Delay what? I’m the best spokesperson. Let him refund the money and get lost.]
# Chapter78
Under further questioning, Tong Zhao discovered that the problem was quite significant.
 

 
When she was filming "One Life Survivor," there were many messages she didn't have time to handle. Her friends knew she was busy with work and didn’t want to disturb her. The "Little Lamb Companion" project had matured well under Tong Zhao’s previous guidance, and Wei Zekai couldn’t find any flaws in it; the only issue was that they were stuck on the promotion aspect.
 

 
This had him so worried that he was nearly bald.
 

 
Tong Zhao had high hopes for "Little Lamb Companion." Not only had she gotten Zeshan to invest in it, but she had also purchased it outright.
 

 
If Tong Zhao believed in the project, he couldn’t mess it up!
 

 
However, Wei Zekai truly lacked experience in marketing, and the proposals from the people he hired didn’t seem good enough.
 

 
With his vast financial resources, he thought about renting a batch of bus stop advertising spaces and purchasing subway ad spots. But then he wondered, would that be effective? The target users for "Little Lamb Companion" were likely not busy office workers... At least during their commutes, they probably wouldn’t feel compelled to download the app or place an order upon seeing such advertisements.
 

 
So how could they promote it effectively?
 

 
Under Tong Zhao’s guidance, Wei Zekai had already begun to adopt the necessary business mindset.
 

 
That was to avoid wasting unnecessary money.
 

 
In the past, the young master Wei had been overly pampered, and what he did was not really investing; at most, it could be considered charity.
 

 
Now, he was being very meticulous with his spending.
 

 
After listening, Tong Zhao first praised him, saying, "Now you understand the importance of saving. Your thinking is correct; don’t buy subway ad spaces, they’re not suitable for 'Little Lamb Companion' at the moment."
 

 
"What should we do instead?"
 

 
Wei Zekai asked sincerely.
 

 
He had always held Tong Zhao’s words in high regard. It wasn’t about romantic feelings; he simply believed that Tong Zhao was stronger than him in business and investment—quite a bit stronger. If they were partners in making money, he should listen to someone more capable. As long as he handled the tasks she assigned him well, he would take credit for it!
 

 
This distinction was quite subtle.
 

 
A man who wants to pamper a woman and listens to her is different from one who finds her strong and excellent and therefore obeys her. The feelings that arise from these two scenarios are not the same.
 

 
Tong Zhao was more inclined to accept the latter.
 

 
Unfortunately, the timing of the question was off, as Wei Zekai recalled a series of “plop plop plop plop...” sounds.
 

 
“…”
 

 
He frowned, sensing that things weren’t simple: “Tong Zhao, what are you doing?”
 

 
Immediately, Wei Zekai heard the sound of water.
 

 
“I’m taking a bath. I got so absorbed in my thoughts that I forgot half my face was submerged in the water.”
 

 
Tong Zhao casually described a rather silly situation.
 

 
Her tone was so flat that Wei Zekai didn’t think much of it. He listened attentively to every proposal she mentioned, taking notes on his iPad as he listened.
 

 
It wasn't until Wei Zekai hung up the phone that he belatedly realized...
 

 
Huh? Tong Zhao was kind of cute just now.
 

 
Wait, she’s taking a bath. Does that mean she’s not wearing any clothes?
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai clasped his hands over his head, trying to stop imagining what was happening on the other end of the call by picturing himself as a stone.
 

 
Stop your shameful imagination!
 

 
...
 

 
The original promotional spokesperson for "Little Lamb Companion" was Peng Yuankang, who was currently in quite a mess.
 

 
His cheating scandal had been exposed, and after a heated argument with his girlfriend, he “accidentally” used too much force, which was captured on camera and turned into undeniable evidence of violent behavior. He lost a significant number of fans. Fortunately, the remaining fans weren't too bright and were particularly eager to support him... but after the numbers dwindled, many partnerships that had been going well fell apart, and some contracts were terminated.
 

 
Capitalists never act foolishly; the contract clearly stated that no major scandals could occur during the cooperation period, and the various clauses made his head spin.
 

 
Many businesses stated that while they wouldn't demand compensation, the funds definitely had to be returned.
 

 
With no energy or money to fight lawsuits, Peng Yuankang had no choice but to refund the money.
 

 
For some businesses that didn’t have time to find a replacement or had no one to replace him, Peng Yuankang knew they would stubbornly use him until the end.
 

 
"Little Lamb Companion" was one of those cases.
 

 
Unexpectedly, that morning, his manager received a call from the other party about terminating the contract and replacing him, and their attitude was quite firm. Last night, after partying until midnight, Peng Yuankang woke up with a hangover and was hugging the toilet to throw up when he heard this news, instantly looking even worse as he angrily said, “If I’m replaced, who else can they find?”
 

 
The promotional budget for this app wasn't high, and they wanted to find a star who could portray a gaming persona.
 

 
He happened to fit both criteria perfectly.
 

 
If it weren’t for the major scandal, he would have been a cost-effective choice for promotion.
 

 
Feeling like "I'm finished, but I can't stand to see you do well," he was like a loser obsessively stalking his ex's Weibo, fixating on the official account of "Little Lamb Companion."
 

 
In the end, there was only a single post announcing the termination of their collaboration with Peng Yuankang.
 

 
The comments below were filled with disappointed fans and satisfied passersby.
 

 
What about the new spokesperson?
 

 
Are they not looking for one?
 

 
It's possible, but how are they planning to promote it?
 

 
Peng Yuankang’s educational background wasn’t great; he was focused on how to gain and retain fans, and how to become popular. After graduating from high school, all he wanted was to become a star. He thought about how easy it would be to gain fans and make money. He only knew that if he became popular, he could sell a single Weibo post for six figures and earn significant promotional fees just by taking a few smiling promotional photos. Money seemed to come as simply as he imagined.
 

 
Fans were only lovable when they were spending money.
 

 
Without those fans willing to download the app repeatedly and provide attractive data for the business, how could this app be promoted? He thought about it for a long time but couldn't come up with a solution. Eventually, he decided to just lie in bed after throwing up and happily scroll through Douyin on his phone.
 

 
As he scrolled, he came across a gameplay video for "Honor of Kings."
 

 
In one game, a female player who enjoyed playing mid-lane was getting "greened.”
 

 
She originally had a jungler partner, but her jungler was lured away by a soft and charming voice belonging to a girl named Yao, who happened to be matched up against the female protagonist. The scumbag, along with his new fling, bullied her, and the new girl mocked her in everyone’s channel, saying she had no one to support her.
 

 
At this moment, the jungler on the female protagonist's side responded: [She has me to support her.]
 

 
Not only was there a voiceover, but it was accompanied by a classic black-and-white, melancholic, and darkened male avatar.
 

 
The voice was so clear that it couldn't have been in-game voice chat.
 

 
It had to have been added in post-production.
 

 
Of course, the result was that the female protagonist, with the help of this super strong random jungler, turned the tables and made a comeback. The female protagonist was very grateful, and the random jungler, using his sexy and husky male god voice, replied casually, “No need to thank me, I’m just playing solo.” Then, he exited the game room. When the female protagonist checked, she discovered he was a newcomer in "Little Lamb Companion" (highlighted in bold and red) and loudly exclaimed, “So downloading this Little Lamb Companion app allows you to find powerful players?” With a curious mindset, she decided to place an order for him…
 

 
“Ah?” Peng Yuankang looked completely bewildered.
 

 
In "Honor of Kings," unless you're in a high-ranked tier or playing at odd hours like late night or early morning, the chances of matching the same players or people you know in lower-ranked matches or fish ponds are very low. (Of course, it’s very low, not impossible.)
 

 
This was clearly staged!
 

 
Can gameplay be staged?
 

 
The key was that the comment section was so unable to distinguish reality from fiction, totally captivated, and enthusiastically discussing this melodramatic plot, complete with download links.
 

 
There were also gender-swapped versions.
 

 
The lonely male players who had gone through breakups encountered the gentle and soft-voiced companions in "Little Lamb Companion," where they both leveled up and healed from their pain.
 

 
The skilled jungler who couldn’t find a girl to play with tried taking orders in "Little Lamb Companion" and ended up making money while finding love.
 

 
After receiving the promotional refund from Peng Yuankang, Tong Zhao divided it into several parts and decided to collaborate with game streamers who charged relatively lower fees, spreading out the investment. She allowed these streamers to have their names featured in "Little Lamb Companion" and, if they were willing, they could actually sign contracts and take orders there, receiving a more favorable revenue share...
 

 
The big streamers would only be listed as names, but many mid-tier and small streamers genuinely wanted to take orders here.
 

 
One sheep is one dollar, and 200 sheep for one game session.
 

 
It’s not cheap, but there will definitely be fans willing to pay.
 

 
For ordinary companionship, the cost generally starts from 10 sheep for one game session, and the price can be increased as their level goes up with more orders.
 

 
Any game can have companions.
 

 
There are also those who read stories, sing to lull people to sleep... Of course, Tong Zhao had the foresight to strictly prohibit inappropriate services, requiring that profile images and backgrounds undergo review to ensure they aren't vulgar or overly revealing.
 

 
This promotional effect was much better than hiring a spokesperson.
 

 
Tong Zhao also pointed out a clear path for Wei Zekai: "There must be people in your friend circle who know about e-sports clubs. When looking for a spokesperson, you should reach out to them. Gamers don’t recognize entertainment industry stars; they only recognize the gaming circle."
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, "So we won't look for spokespeople in the entertainment industry?"
 

 
Tong Zhao sent him some of her best promotional photos, telling him to find someone to edit them, and once that was done, she would inform her agent to finalize the matter.
 

 
The blue ocean market of companionship and training was thoroughly occupied by Zeshan under her forward-thinking decisions.
 

 
The first person to take the plunge gets to seize all the advantages.
 

 
First, they captured the target customer group with streamers and game videos. As long as a large number of curious players came to join, some to consume and others to earn money, the "Little Lamb Companion" platform became "alive." Finally, Tong Zhao stepped in as a spokesperson, allowing the general public to discover this formal and convenient software, elevating its status.
 

 
Everyone in the industry couldn't help but marvel at how difficult it is to make a platform-based software popular; throwing money at ad placements and splash screens is like pouring money into a bottomless pit.
 

 
Who would have thought that directing and acting out some melodramatic gaming stories could spread virally?
 

 
There must be experts behind this!
 

 
But who are these experts?
 

 
It’s easy to trace the ownership of a software company, and it quickly led to the venture capital firm Zeshan behind it. No one doing business in the city was unaware that this group of playful second-generation wealthy individuals had a wise mentor behind them. It seemed that this was also the handiwork of that wise mentor. Many wealthy individuals secretly inquired with the Wei family, wondering if they could invite this behind-the-scenes expert at a high price for some guidance.
 

 
The Wei family, knowing the truth, thought: …
 

 
If he said this expert was a twenty-something female star, would these people believe it?
 

 
Mr. Wei was vague and could only say that this expert had a deep connection with his little Kai, describing them as a person of great skill whom he had known since childhood. Their reputation was high enough that it wasn’t convenient to reveal their identity.
 

 
Two days later, a message circulated in the city's elite circles.
 

 
The wise expert behind Zeshan was none other than Wei Zekai's godfather.
 

 
...
 

 
Unbeknownst to her, Tong Zhao's other identity was rising in value.
 

 
And as for her, after knowing that this promotional strategy was feasible and that the software’s marketing was on the right track, she continued to be the hands-off manager.
 

 
After all, there were more important matters at hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao went for the audition for "The Knives of the Maiden." The audition location was not in her city.
 

 
However, in the holographic era, Director Shi speculated that since she was busy with her rising fame, he didn’t insist that she come to Qin City; they could connect via a holographic filming chamber in the film studio to access the cloud data.
 

 
Tong Zhao's impression of Director Shi improved even further.
 

 
The script for "The Knives of the Maiden" was not complicated, and she watched it alongside other characters.
 

 
The main character, Xie Guiya, had a name that resembled those in martial arts novels, but she had no interest in chivalry or heroics. Her biggest wish was to get accepted into a good university and find an ordinary job after graduation...
 

 
Although she couldn't imagine herself getting married and having children, she firmly believed her life would be on the right track.
 

 
She longed for an ordinary life too much!
 

 
At university, Xie Guiya, who maintained a sense of distance from everyone, fell in love with the campus heartthrob. While they were dating at a milk tea shop during the day, they heard about a bizarre theft of a cultural relic from China. Beside the empty safe was a brand-new knife, and the stolen antiquity was exactly a knife. This was already the third cultural relic theft this season, and each time a weapon was lost, the same type of weapon would appear in the location, only it was brand new.
 

 
The reasons for the theft were various, and the campus heartthrob sighed that it really felt like something out of a martial arts film—how enchanting!
 

 
Xie Guiya asked him, "Do you really like martial arts movies?”
 

 
The campus heartthrob immediately became energized and enthusiastically recommended his favorite martial arts novels to her—turns out he was a martial arts fan. He had read all the high-quality and well-known novels, movies, and comics. He was also well-versed in various urban legends, including the one about a martial arts family with a history of over a hundred years that was said to be living as hermits in this city...
 

 
“By the way, your name has a very martial arts vibe too. Others say your name sounds masculine, but I particularly like it.” The campus heartthrob looked at her with affection, feeling he was quite good at sweet-talking!
 

 
However, the female lead's mentality broke at that moment.
 

 
Because Xie Guiya actually came from a martial arts family.
 

 
The “hundred-year-old martial arts family” that the campus heartthrob mentioned… was her family. Since childhood, her father had insisted that she practice martial arts. Why? Because her father grew up during the era that promoted the idea that women could hold up half the sky. He was very patriotic and listened to the leaders, believing in gender equality, insisting that both men and women should practice martial arts for self-defense! Xie Guiya was an extraordinary martial arts talent, effortlessly training even better than her brother while maintaining an expressionless demeanor and complaining lightly.
 

 
But Xie Guiya only wanted to be an ordinary person; she didn’t want to become the modern martial arts leader.
 

 
The main storyline revolves around the theft of cultural relics, which leads to the upcoming 108th martial arts conference about to take place in the city.
 

 
The subplot involves the female lead resolving this seemingly ridiculous modern martial arts incident while learning that Huaxia martial arts are a cultural inheritance, reconciling her inner conflicts, and reaching personal growth.
 

 
So who should go?
 

 
Director Shi was attracted by Duan Ge from "One Life Survivor," so it seemed natural for him to choose Duan Ge for this role.
 

 
Duan Ge: “I just killed twenty people in the movie, and I've been feeling particularly murderous lately. I might just kill all the competitors for the leadership position before going back to studying.”
 

 
...That makes sense.
 

 
"How about I go?" the female reporter suggested.
 

 
Journalism is a clerical profession, but not all journalists are the same.
 

 
Her first anti-war news was that of a war correspondent.
 

 
However, her personality is much more peaceful than Duan Ge’s; she even possesses a softness and kindness that sometimes border on excessive compassion, which often leads her to depression as she searches for the truth behind others' suffering.
 

 
Tong Zhao pondered for a moment and decided to consult Director Shi—
 

 
Her subconscious inclination is toward diversity; everyone knows this. She couldn’t decide which side of herself to bring to the character of Xie Guiya. If possible, could she audition twice, allowing Director Shi to choose which side to use?
 

 
Shi Dingjun was surprised.
 

 
The production costs for a film can be high, but if only one segment is filmed for the audition, the price is not so exorbitant.
 

 
The director agreed, allowing her to portray the same segment with different mindsets to see how it would turn out.
# Chapter79
Qin City.
 

 
Inside a diamond-grade audition room.
 

 
"Director Shi, did you really agree to such an absurd request?"
 

 
The supervisor of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wore a look of disapproval.
 

 
He knew the director admired Tong Zhao, had seen her movies and variety shows, and thought she had great potential to play Xie Guiya, but the idea that someone could possess multiple subconscious personas? That sounded too far-fetched to him.
 

 
The supervisor had seen actors, enraged by finding out their girlfriends cheated on them just before an audition, suddenly transform from their usual mild-mannered selves into volatile, aggressive characters once they got into the role.
 

 
He had also seen actors who, desperate for a final chance at an audition, broke through their own limitations of timidity and delivered excellent performances.
 

 
But those situations were different from what Tong Zhao was describing.
 

 
"Multiple subconscious personas in one person? I think she’s just buying into the hype about her ‘most special subconscious’ persona," the supervisor shook his head, disappointed. He had a good impression of Tong Zhao before, but her recent behavior was ruining that. He added a logical inference, "Maybe she just really wants the role and is afraid she won’t perform well in a single audition, so she’s scheming to get two chances. If she were honest about it, I wouldn’t be so irritated."
 

 
Director Shi smiled good-naturedly.
 

 
"You’re only doing this because of the old curator, right?" the supervisor asked.
 

 
"Movies and actors are a two-way choice. Tong Zhao is currently valued highly in commercial films," Director Shi, though having high standards for movies, spoke smoothly, never really saying much while remaining respectful to everyone. "I’d like to see the results of the audition first before making any judgments. At the very least, her action scenes should be quite impressive."
 

 
"That’s true. This is a new experiment for you, after all. The lead must have strong personal charisma, and she can definitely pull that off." Reluctantly, the supervisor acknowledged her strengths.
 

 
Tong Zhao was well-liked by the audience.
 

 
This couldn’t be explained by just her appearance. Perhaps it was because she had experienced many different lives, continuously offering something new to the audience while allowing them to always find something they liked in her. And when she occasionally revealed her true self, the audience couldn’t quite figure out who she really was, adding a mysterious allure to her stardom.
 

 
That was the industry’s analysis, trying to uncover her "secret to overnight success."
 

 
But so far, no one had been able to replicate it.
 

 
The supervisor glanced at the clock.
 

 
In Director Shi Dingjun’s special audition room, there was an unusually designed clock with hands shaped like swords of varying lengths, giving off an intense and intimidating vibe. "Are the supporting actors ready?"
 

 
"They’re already in the filming pod."
 

 
"Good."
 

 
"What about Tong Zhao?"
 

 
……
 

 
[Who’s going first?]
 

 
When Tong Zhao entered the private audition room, she asked the other personas for their opinions.
 

 
Duan Ge responded, [Shall I go?]
 

 
Tong Zhao readily agreed, giving up her role as the primary persona.
 

 
Due to budget considerations, the lead and supporting actors would audition together. Supporting actors wouldn’t be given a second chance, so even though Duan Ge and the female reporter (Shen Shuyi) were performing the same scene, the supporting actors would be different.
 

 
Aside from the male lead and the villain, the other two supporting actors were in their third round of auditions.
 

 
Accompanied by the faint hum of the air conditioner, Duan Ge fell into a deep sleep.
 

 
……
 

 
The purpose of the audition was to test whether the actor’s subconscious matched the character.
 

 
The clearest way to see this was in the character's choices and reactions.
 

 
Scene: The top floor of a luxurious clubhouse in Jiang City.
 

 
Characters:
 
- Xie Guiya (protagonist)
 
- Cheng Siwen (important male supporting role)
 
- Plum Blossom Swordsman (supporting role)
 
- Horse Boxer (supporting role)
 
- Fu Xuancheng (important supporting role)
 

 
Combat rankings in this scenario: Fu Xuancheng > Plum Blossom Swordsman = Xie Guiya > Horse Boxer >>>>> Cheng Siwen
 

 
Plot: Xie Guiya, attending the martial arts tournament in place of her father, who injured his back during a midlife crisis and couldn’t lift his sword, needs to make a strong entrance to impress the martial arts elites. At the same time, she has to bring her boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, who has no fighting skills, to identify a notorious thief.
 

 
The challenge is to assert dominance over the other supporting characters while protecting her boyfriend.
 

 
In the script, the writer set up the "protection" as the female lead using various methods to prevent the others from harming him.
 

 
She could rely on intelligence or intimidation through martial prowess.
 

 
The main goal was to see if the actor's subconscious could create chemistry with the character.
 

 
Fight scenes could be compensated with choreography, a common approach in action films. Backed by the old curator, Director Shi Dingjun had access to the best action designers.
 

 
The supervisor recalled the two previous actors who had already gone home to wait for results.
 

 
The first, Qin Yisi, was tall. She wore a mask and disguised herself as a man. Before her debut in films, she had been involved in online voice acting and could naturally produce a deep male voice without the need for a voice modulator, making Cheng Siwen pass as her brother.
 

 
Director Shi gave her a passing grade but felt she lacked confidence.
 

 
Why did she have to disguise herself as a man?
 

 
The ability to imitate a male voice was a nice touch, but Director Shi wanted to portray a modern female hero this time, so he sent her home to wait for further news.
 

 
The second, Zhang He, had Cheng Siwen pretend to be a waiter, entering separately from her, while she secretly told her friends to call the police if they didn’t hear from her for a certain period. This approach was too pragmatic and clearly reflected her personality.
 

 
This wasn’t the Xie Guiya Director Shi wanted.
 

 
In his audition notes, he wrote: [Reflects Xie Guiya's self-perception but lacks uniqueness. Unable to capture the real essence of her character. Her actions are reasonable and steady, but the connection to the character is weak.]
 

 
In the female lead’s eyes, she was practical and had no relation to being a hero.
 

 
But in reality, she grew up immersed in a martial arts family and had a heroic spirit.
 

 
The entire film was about her journey from repressing that spirit to finally accepting it.
 

 
The supervisor mumbled quietly, "Actually, I thought Qin Yisi did a pretty good job."
 

 
"Her choice to disguise herself as a man for the sake of courage was a major negative for me. While this might have been understandable in a patriarchal era, it’s unnecessary in a modern setting."
 

 
Director Shi shook his head. "I want to convey the essence of traditional martial arts through this film. There’s no need to perpetuate outdated values."
 

 
The monitor lit up.
 

 
This meant Tong Zhao had entered the world of the holographic film.
 

 
……
 

 
Outside the luxury clubhouse in Jiang City.
 

 
"Baby, should I follow you inside?"
 

 
The protagonist’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, the film’s male supporting character, asked.
 

 
The model created by Duan Ge’s subconscious was dressed in an ordinary outfit, not disguised in a mask and men’s clothing like Qin Yisi's version, nor wearing any eccentric clothes. She wasn’t even in pants suitable for fighting but in a knee-length cocktail dress.
 

 
The modeler pulled up data showing that this cocktail dress could be easily removed by unfastening a side button, revealing black shorts underneath.
 

 
The difference between the audition and the official shoot was that in the audition, the actors chose their outfits based on their subconscious desires rather than pre-designed costumes. The AI would select something that aligned with the actor’s imagination from the modeling database, ensuring the props met the audition’s needs.
 

 
This explained the previous actor’s mask and men’s attire.
 

 
"Why wear a dress?" the modeler asked, puzzled.
 

 
"Because wearing jeans to such an event would look strange," the supervisor, having watched countless films, immediately understood the logic. He saw the overlap between Duan Ge’s thinking and the character’s: "Attending a martial arts gathering, which is a super-realist setting, while maintaining a grounded and practical mindset—this performance is very in tune with the protagonist!"
 

 
Once the audition began, the supervisor quickly put aside his previous biases against her.
 

 
Sure enough, all the men and women entering the clubhouse were dressed in formal attire.
 

 
Duan Ge’s simple dress was already quite understated.
 

 
The supervisor commented, "The outfits worn by the previous two actors attracted attention from passersby, which actually goes against the protagonist’s principle of keeping a low profile in front of ‘ordinary people.’"
 

 
They continued watching.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded and instructed, "Don’t call me baby in there. Call me sis."
 

 
She briefly explained that her boyfriend should act like her little brother or lackey. "Whatever you think—subordinate, follower, or gofer. If I scold or hit you, just bear with it. Don’t talk, do less, and use your eyes to observe."
 

 
"Are you going to hit me?" Cheng Siwen looked dumbfounded.
 

 
He hadn’t expected his girlfriend to be so fierce, but behind his dazed look was a trace of excitement.
 

 
It wasn’t that he had a masochistic streak, but the character setting made him fascinated by anything related to martial arts, sparking positive emotions in him. (All character traits were controlled by manipulating brain chemicals to trigger preferences).
 

 
Duan Ge nodded slightly and whispered a few more instructions in his ear.
 

 
The actor playing Cheng Siwen had a more submissive subconscious, and with Duan Ge’s authoritative tone, he nodded obediently
 

 
The director and Mr. Shi were curious about what she said, feeling quite intrigued.
 

 
Unconsciously, they had already been somewhat drawn into the scene, like watching a movie and not wanting to immediately uncover the mystery.
 

 
After taking the elevator to the top floor, they were greeted by a vast rooftop and an infinity pool.
 

 
Three supporting actors were already waiting there for the two of them.
 

 
"You are the successor of Xie Shengyi?"
 

 
The martial artist asked, looking at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
This was a default assumption, that the person who could attend in place of their father had to be a man.
 

 
Previously, Qin Yisi had caught the attention of the supporting characters by wearing an eye-catching mask and men's clothing, preventing any cases of mistaken identity.
 

 
Cheng Siwen kept in mind what his girlfriend had told him—don’t speak, do less—and kept his head down, observing in secret.
 

 
"I'm talking to you."
 

 
The martial artist strode forward.
 

 
Each step exuded the aura of a mere cannon fodder.
 

 
"What will Tong Zhao do next?" the director wondered.
 

 
As soon as he spoke, in the filming scene, Duan Ge moved faster than the martial artist. Using two moves of Bajiquan, she struck his vital points, leaving him stunned. She then grabbed the fabric of his back, pulling him down, while raising her knee to strike his chest. The front and back of a person’s chest are places that cannot withstand heavy blows easily. The martial artist, whose strength was set lower than the protagonist at this point, had no ability to fight back.
 

 
Duan Ge’s subconscious had been infused with a lot of martial arts knowledge, all of which the protagonist had learned from a young age.
 

 
She chose the most brutal and ruthless close-combat style of Bajiquan.
 

 
"Ouch."
 

 
The director felt the pain just watching it.
 

 
"Tong Zhao really hits hard. If she’s not careful, she could kill someone. She’s basically going for the kill," Mr. Shi, being an expert, saw it even more clearly. Initially surprised, he then recalled that she was a ruthless character who had eliminated 20 people on a reality survival show. That made it all seem reasonable. "Her subconscious temper is really explosive."
 

 
The martial artist saw stars and could barely stand.
 

 
The other supporting actor and villain had no intention of helping him.
 

 
He opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, he got beaten up again.
 

 
The AI scanned Cheng Siwen's character, who had a loud inner monologue: "Yes, it's now! She's going to ask me to speak up and stop her!"
 

 
"Sis, if you keep hitting him, you're going to kill him..."
 

 
"Hmm?"
 

 
Duan Ge grabbed the martial artist, who had passed out, by the back of the neck like he was trash and looked back at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
In the camera shot, her eyes were indifferent and deep, with the reflections from the infinity pool lights in her pupils, shimmering like the glint of madness.
 

 
She let go, and the man collapsed to the ground.
 

 
Facing Cheng Siwen and the camera, from the perspective of the other two characters, she lifted a wicked smile and softly said, "Are you teaching me how to do things?"
 

 
From the view of the two supporting actors, she was even attacking her own people.
 

 
There was no need to explain. Her actions and presence had already conveyed that she was the sole heir of the Xie family.
 

 
Pure madness!
 

 
This unpredictable hidden strength, combined with her ruthlessness, made the other two wary of her.
 

 
The director finally pulled up the protagonist's inner monologue for this scene.
 

 
Duan Ge wasn't actually insane.
 

 
She simply knew that in this banquet, she was the primary target. One against three was a fight she couldn't win. So, she chose to single out one person and beat them up to establish dominance. But how to ensure no one would touch Cheng Siwen? Her reasoning was that no one would be interested in a minor character. By making him act timid and allowing him to be scolded in front of everyone, she figured they’d see him as insignificant and useless and would simply ignore him.
 

 
At the same time, he also served as a tool to display her imposing aura.
 

 
She pretended to hit him a few times, but it was all for show—lots of noise but little harm.
 

 
Cheng Siwen recognized the infamous thief Fu Xuancheng. After testing the waters, he quietly and pitifully asked her, "Weren't you supposed to not really hit me?"
 

 
Duan Ge:
 

 
"Anyone I really hit is already waiting to get into the ICU. You'll just cry for two days and be sore for a week, and then you'll be fine."
 

 
Pulled into her twisted logic, Cheng Siwen whispered his thanks.
 

 
The audition ended with a shot of him looking slightly confused, wondering if he had been tricked.
 

 
The director laughed out loud. "Tong Zhao is funny, but she seems a bit too fierce."
 

 
"I want to see that other side of her that Tong Zhao mentioned."
 

 
Mr. Shi noted this on her audition feedback: "Highly skilled at utilizing the martial arts knowledge infused into her subconscious, adept at using the people and objects around her to highlight her character and achieve plot objectives. Has a certain comedic sense, but is a bit too fierce. If we decide to use her, the script might need slight adjustments."
 

 
After watching Tong Zhao's audition, Mr. Shi felt a strong urge to choose her.
 

 
But "The Knives of the Maiden" might not be quite the right fit for her.
 

 
Unless the script was rewritten...
 

 
The screenwriter, who had already been asked by the client to rewrite the story about ten times before the audition even started, sighed:
 

 
"Director, why are you looking at me?”
# Chapter80
"Do you need some time to prepare?"
 

 
Director Shi asked with concern over the phone.
 

 
From his perspective, switching between two entirely different emotional states must be quite mentally taxing. Audition time is precious, and typically, actors wait anxiously for their turn. However, after the first audition, he was willing to wait for Tong Zhao to be ready, as he just wanted to see her in her best state.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Shuyi, are you ready?]
 
[I'm fine.]
 
[If I can help you out this time, that would be great.]
 

 
Shuyi smiled.
 

 
Ever since returning to her original world and stepping back into the entertainment industry, Tong Zhao had been living a relaxed and healthy life, far from negative emotions. This cheerful mental state nourished the journalist—no, Shen Shuyi—allowing her to rediscover her own name.
 

 
All of this, she thought, was the system's fault.
 

 
Back then, the system gave Shuyi a task to hand in three news articles, all on dark and brutal subjects.
 

 
But Shuyi was the kindest among them, the one who most wanted to pursue justice.
 

 
The public needed the truth, and the higher-ups needed to be held accountable by the people.
 

 
If a portion of the population could be saved, if younger generations could be warned, and if the voices of the vulnerable could be heard, she would be willing to risk everything, even if it meant crashing and burning.
 

 
Thinking of this, Tong Zhao realized that she, too, had a sense of chivalry.
 

 
Tong Zhao thanked the director for his consideration. "No need, let's go straight into it."
 

 
"Alright, I'll restart the program on my end."
 

 
Without removing the equipment, Tong Zhao once again drifted into a dream.
 

 
...
 

 
The familiar time and place.
 

 
The luxurious club in Jiang City, outside the Hero Mansion.
 

 
"Darling, should I follow you inside later?"
 

 
Cheng Siwen asked.
 

 
All the backstage staff had their eyes on the main character, not sparing even a glance at him.
 

 
Now, facing the same lines and the same situation, what kind of different reactions and choices would Tong Zhao make?
 

 
Everyone was shocked to discover—
 

 
Tong Zhao's subconscious had conjured a different outfit!
 

 
She was dressed in a Burberry trench coat, underneath a simple white shirt—no extra embroidery or logo, just a plain white shirt. Paired with short black dress pants, her long, slender legs were strikingly eye-catching.
 

 
There's no denying it—her height and exceptional body proportions suited this style perfectly.
 

 
...
 

 
"Wha-wha-what... how did she manage to achieve such a huge psychological shift in such a short time?!"
 

 
The head of the modeling team exclaimed in disbelief.
 

 
The more professional someone is, the more they can appreciate the marvel that is Tong Zhao, beyond just her outfit change.
 

 
Normal subconscious activity tends to solidify in the short term and flow in the long term.
 

 
In simpler terms, the moon may become full, and people may change, but the moon doesn’t go from crescent to full in just a few minutes. It’s like certain flashy, unreliable weight-loss drugs that promise you can lose 30 pounds in three days without exercising—the only possible way to achieve that is through amputation.
 

 
This was already beyond his comprehension.
 

 
Director Shi frowned and said, "Quiet. Let’s discuss it after we’ve finished watching."
 

 
He didn’t care if it made sense. He was only interested in what kind of effect Tong Zhao would show him in her second audition.
 

 
The assistant director nodded.
 

 
Even without knowing the full truth, he could sense the subtle changes between the two personalities: "This time, the outfit imagined by Tong Zhao’s subconscious seems to have a higher sense of quality."
 

 
After all, Duan Ge (Tong Zhao's character) was one of Tong Zhao’s personalities that lived a more austere life.
 

 
It was hard enough for her to get a decent meal, let alone worry about picking out clothes. She could accept the concept of wearing clothes that suited the occasion, but she wouldn’t think much about the brand or style—comfort and functionality were more important. However, Shuyi, after helping to broker a ceasefire between two nations and returning to the bustling city to receive recognition, was outwardly adorned in high-end fashion, reflecting the admiration and joy of those around her, even though she felt no inner emotion.
 

 
"Does Tong Zhao have bad eyesight? This is the first time I’ve seen her wearing glasses," an assistant wondered.
 

 
Not only was she wearing glasses, but they were heavy, thick-framed, black-rimmed glasses.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s small face made the glasses look less awkward, lending her a scholarly air while emphasizing her petite features. The large frames seemed to take up nearly a third of her face, accentuating her fair complexion.
 

 
The assistant director was unconcerned. "Maybe it’s just a fashionable accessory with no prescription."
 

 
"Is that even fashionable?" another staff member asked, confused.
 

 
"She looks good in them, though."
 

 
The assistant director saw no issue, so no one else dared to point out that the glasses really weren’t fashionable. It was only because she had a good figure that they looked good on her...
 

 
A script modeling technician checked the database to see if the glasses had a prescription.
 

 
It was possible she had been wearing contact lenses before.
 

 
Such small data points wouldn’t impact the overall plot.
 

 
But when the technician saw the glasses’ data in the system, they gasped.
 

 
In the audition scene:
 

 
"This time, I’m not well-prepared, but it’ll have to do," Shuyi glanced at her naive boyfriend and shook her head. "No, you don’t need to follow me. I used last week’s tutoring wages to buy these smart glasses with a recording function. After I come out, just cross-check the faces I record."
 

 
Assistant Director & Director & Scriptwriter & Staff: "..."
 

 
Wait, is this what you call ‘not well-prepared’!?
 

 
Tong Zhao did indeed have a budget of under 20,000 yuan, as her character was designed to be a frugal and outstanding university student who worked part-time as a tutor. Because she attended a prestigious university, her hourly wage was quite high. Most of her money was methodically saved for the future, as her character hoped to own a house by the age of 30.
 

 
At this moment, the technician who had just checked the database chimed in, "Those smart Bluetooth glasses have an HD camera. If you blink four times, it records a shot. Plus, they use bone-conduction headphones, allowing discreet real-time communication with Cheng Siwen.”
 

 
The staff members were speechless.
 

 
Smart glasses, well, they aren't exactly new.
 

 
When they first came out, they were overhyped, and when people saw how bulky and unattractive they were, combined with the fact that the functionality was far from the hacker-age technology they imagined, they lost interest immediately. Except for a few tech enthusiasts, most people didn’t pay much attention to them, and few realized that they had since become lighter, more stylish, and affordable.
 

 
The database had plenty of models to choose from, but the catch was whether the actor could imagine using them. The first two actors didn’t even think of such a method. They only thought about how inconvenient it would be to secretly take photos with a phone, which is why they figured they had to bring the weakling Cheng Siwen along.
 

 
Even Duan Ge hadn’t thought of it.
 

 
Director Shi pondered, “But this idea doesn’t disrupt the tone of the movie. It’s very much something Xie Guiya would do.”
 

 
It’s a clash between modern technology and traditional martial arts, and the protagonist is a modern-day female warrior.
 

 
"Other than having the same face, this performance is completely different from her last audition. I don’t think the Tong Zhao from the previous scene would use smart glasses unless someone gave them to her as a prop," the assistant director analyzed.
 

 
Subconscious creativity varies in strength, and it can be field-specific. For example, someone who has been a civil servant in real life, or whose family has been involved in government, might have a keen sense of navigating social interactions. When their subconscious enters a film setting, they might creatively tweak scenes involving interpersonal conflict, which could lead to script changes.
 

 
If these tweaks don’t derail the plot, they can actually be positive, reflecting the actor’s subconscious creativity.
 

 
In the world of traditional filmmaking, this would be called “improvisation.”
 

 
"I’ll be worried if you go in alone," Cheng Siwen said. Though he was gentle and obedient to his girlfriend, in the script, he played a righteous character. In reality, he was a young, sunny, and handsome actor. Hearing that his girlfriend planned to face danger alone made him feel uneasy.
 

 
But objectively speaking, it was indeed better if he didn’t go in.
 

 
So how would Tong Zhao resolve this?
 

 
Shuyi glanced at her watch and said, "I'll give you one minute. Come up with a way to help me without causing trouble."
 

 
Cheng Siwen couldn’t think of anything.
 

 
She smiled and logged into a cloud account on his phone. "The photos I take will be uploaded to the cloud," she said, blinking four times. As expected, within ten seconds, a close-up photo of Cheng Siwen’s face appeared in the cloud photo album. “If I encounter any danger I can’t handle, I’ll snap a bunch of meaningless floor photos. Then you…”
 

 
“Call the police?”
 

 
“No, you’ll take the pictures of their faces that I uploaded and forward them to your QQ account.”
 

 
Shuyi spoke with calm, serene eyes set in her strikingly beautiful face.
 

 
She continued, “Think about it. Who am I?”
 

 
“The heir to the Xie family!”
 

 
Cheng Siwen instantly answered, his face lighting up with excitement, like a fanboy seeing his favorite superhero.
 

 
“…I’m a university student from Qin who doesn’t want anyone to know I’m moonlighting as a vigilante.”
 

 
Shuyi said, “In modern society, there are no hidden warriors. Even the leader of a martial arts alliance has to work a regular job. They inevitably have an open identity. I don’t need you to call the police. I just need them to know that I have pictures of their faces. I don’t believe all three of them would be indifferent to having their identities exposed.”
 

 
“As long as one of them cares, the other two will stop him from doing anything reckless.”
 

 
Her explanation woke her boyfriend up.
 

 
Putting himself in their shoes, Cheng Siwen realized that the other side would be afraid too. This was Shuyi’s way of handling things.
 

 
Convinced, Cheng Siwen no longer insisted on going in with her.
 

 
As soon as Shuyi entered, she used her smart glasses to take a group photo of the three men.
 

 
When the Ma boxer provoked her, Shuyi quickly subdued him as well. However, unlike Duan Ge, she wasn’t as ruthless. She stopped just before hitting a vital point. “Can’t we resolve this peacefully? By now, it’s clear I’m the heir to the Xie family, right?” The Ma boxer pretended to apologize and beg for mercy, hoping to catch her off guard and strike back. But Shuyi, already prepared, kicked him in the knee, forcing him to kneel!
 

 
She stepped on his thigh, blinked four more times, and said in an incredibly polite, gentle voice, "It seems you only listen when you're on your knees."
 

 
As a journalist, Shuyi was used to facing danger in tough situations during interviews.
 

 
She knew how to handle thugs. She wasn’t easy to deal with.
 

 
She then told the Ma boxer that she had taken his photo and threatened to uncover his real identity, showing him the cloud album on her phone. “Smashing my phone won’t help. The photos are already uploaded to my boyfriend’s device… Of course, I really don’t want to resort to such harsh methods. My father often says that martial arts gatherings are meant to foster friendship, not to indulge in violence.”
 

 
The Plum Blossom Swordsman was stunned, shaking his head, "Matters of the martial world should never involve ordinary people."
 

 
In the story's setting, the Plum Blossom Swordsman is a high school teacher, not a villain, and he is very reluctant to reveal his identity. This is something the protagonist will discover as the main plot unfolds.
 

 
Shuyi mimicked his sigh and said, "There's nothing we can do. Young people these days just don’t follow the old code of honor."
 

 
As expected, there was no fight. Instead, she cleverly steered the conversation toward the movie’s central plot—the theft case—gleaning a lot of information that shouldn’t have been let slip. The Plum Blossom Swordsman, who had been highly guarded around Duan Ge, opened up to Shen Shuyi like a middle-aged man venting his frustrations.
 

 
Even the only true villain, the notorious thief Fu Xuancheng, was subtly influenced by her. He impulsively blurted out something meaningful:
 

 
"Maybe the person who stole the artifact didn’t actually intend to frame us."
 

 
Shen Shuyi gave him a long, thoughtful look.
 

 
…
 

 
The audition ended the moment the protagonist and the antagonist's eyes met.
 

 
The entire casting room could hardly believe that the person who had just auditioned twice was the same actor.
 

 
The assistant director no longer accused Tong Zhao of trying to grandstand. Instead, he turned to the director and asked, "Director Shi, what’s your evaluation of her second audition?”
# Chapter81
All eyes were focused on Director Shi, waiting for his evaluation.
 

 
“If we only discuss Tong Zhao's second audition, you’ll notice that her posture was much lower than in the first audition. Here, 'lower' doesn’t mean humble; it means she was more willing to listen to other characters and wanted to understand them. During both auditions, Cheng Siwen reminded Tong Zhao that the villain was Fu Xuancheng…”
 

 
“In the first audition, Tong Zhao was obviously wary of him. She and the other characters were in a binary opposition; you could see that she was confrontational with everyone, but she took good care of Cheng Siwen, who obeyed her.” Director Shi pulled up a short clip where Duan Ge signaled for him to go to the back with his eyes, actually using himself to block the gaze that others were directing at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
“However, in the second audition, aside from her initially asserting her strength and boundaries, her communication with the other supporting characters was very open and inclusive throughout.”
 

 
Director Shi paused for a moment, coming up with a nickname for her: “The Plum Blossom Swordsman is very resistant to Tong Zhao One but feels a sense of familiarity with Tong Zhao Two. He is even willing to share a lot of information with her that he didn’t mention in the first audition.”
 

 
To direct a good film in the era of instinctive cinema, one must understand human nature very well and possess keen observational skills.
 

 
Because it captures the truest reactions, it's akin to temporarily holding the power of God.
 

 
“It's incredible that the same person can express so many different facets.”
 

 
“I prefer Tong Zhao One; she’s powerful. Whether you give her a saber or a sword, it should work well.”
 

 
“Just watch 'Heartless Tribulation,' and you’ll see that Tong Zhao is, in my mind, the most suitable woman to wield a sword—bar none.”
 

 
It was during this discussion that the team realized there were hidden fans of Tong Zhao among them.
 

 
As the auditions concluded, the other supporting actors gradually woke up and entered the room. Seeing everyone so engrossed in conversation, Tang Yanhao, who played Cheng Siwen, curiously asked, “How did I perform just now?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The audition room fell into silence as if someone had pressed the mute button.
 

 
He immediately grew anxious: “Did I mess up my performance?”
 

 
“No, you didn’t mess up,” the screenwriter said sympathetically as he put a hand on his shoulder, “You were overshadowed…”
 

 
As soon as Tang Yanhao entered, everyone suddenly realized that all they could remember was Tong Zhao, and the focus during the audition had been entirely on her… In "The Knives of the Maiden," Xie Guiya is undoubtedly the main character, but Cheng Siwen is also an important supporting character throughout the film, and in the earlier audition, this sunny and handsome boy was quite charming.
 

 
On screen, Tong Zhao was like a vortex, drawing the audience’s attention.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Was it her beautiful face? Cheng Siwen was also a handsome guy!
 

 
The director commented, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious gives her a stronger dramatic presence; you always feel like she’ll create some kind of commotion. It’s very dramatic.”
 

 
Using terms like “drama queen” or “overly dramatic” can carry slightly negative connotations.
 

 
So in the end, he chose a commonly used foreign adjective.
 

 
The people present were indeed elites in the instinctive film industry. Even if they didn’t know the source of Tong Zhao’s charm, they had indirectly guessed it—because her personality was born out of the experiences from her quick-changing roles; she was living a life that was anything but ordinary, and her subconscious could constantly provide dramatic expressions.
 

 
Director Shi looked thoughtfully at the two screens displaying Tong Zhao in different outfits.
 

 
“It’s difficult to evaluate as a whole, but I have a bold idea.”
 

 
Although Director Shi was not young, he had always been daring in innovation within the industry.
 

 
Despite the fact that he could easily make money by filming straightforward martial arts movies, he still chose to challenge himself by incorporating new elements that had rarely been explored before. Upon hearing this, everyone cast curious glances at him, while only the screenwriter nervously asked, “So, does that mean we need to change the script?”
 

 
“It’s unrelated to the script. I need to discuss it with the director.”
 

 
The screenwriter visibly relaxed upon hearing this.
 

 
As long as there was no need to change the script!
 

 
After Director Shi finished speaking, he delegated a few miscellaneous tasks and left the audition room with the director. As they walked, their voices were not loud, but they didn’t avoid being heard by others. Consequently, some gossipers perked up their ears, and passersby in the hallway caught fragments of their conversation—
 

 
“... too extroverted, hard to rein in...”
 

 
“... not as good as the first time...”
 

 
“... there will be difficulties in filming... increased costs... subconscious changes...”
 

 
Eventually, the two entered the elevator.
 

 
Once the heavy metal elevator doors closed, silence fell, effectively cutting off the curious ears that had been listening in.
 

 
Director Shi had a bit of an accent, and when he got excited, his voice would increase in volume.
 

 
This was the content that all the gossipers intermittently caught; when pieced together, it seemed to convey that they were quite critical of Tong Zhao, suggesting that she was not as good as Qin Meizi, who had come for the audition the first time, and that they were criticizing the instability of Tong Zhao’s subconscious.
 

 
So that was it!
 

 
It seemed that despite Tong Zhao’s elaborate efforts to audition twice, she ultimately still failed.
 

 
Upon reaching this conclusion, everyone’s eyes sparkled with excitement as they couldn’t wait to share the “firsthand information” with their friends during the waiting period for notifications—
 

 
[That popular female celebrity really came to audition for Director Shi's new project, and the result was quite shocking.]
 

 
[She wasn’t selected, wasn’t selected. But that’s not the main point; the key is that she requested to audition for the same segment twice, saying she had two sides to her subconscious, possibly thinking that this would be eye-catching… somehow, maybe she wanted to score points in front of the director? But in the end, that was also why she wasn’t chosen.]
 

 
[It seems they felt she was not as good as Qin Yisi.]
 

 
[Exactly, actually Uncle Dingjun is very kind; he’s not as fierce as the outside world thinks. The instinctive film industry is also not as mysterious as outsiders imagine. I learned from Uncle Dingjun that even if you’re a celebrity, you shouldn’t get carried away by marketing hype and fans; you still need to be grounded. Having a diverse subconscious can bring too many disadvantages to filming, not to mention she’s so expensive.]
 

 
[I don’t know the exact price, but I heard Tong Zhao's current worth is this amount! ￥￥￥￥￥￥￥￥]
 

 
……
 

 
Such conversations quietly spread.
 

 
Those indulging in this gossip reveled in schadenfreude.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s path had been too smooth. The resources she started with weren’t even top-tier, yet within a year, she not only participated in the Li Zhi TV gala but also starred in the highly acclaimed and commercially successful film "Heartless Tribulation." While her fans were enjoying her success, her peers were filled with envy.
 

 
They didn’t consider themselves to be saints who could calmly watch their peers succeed; it was entirely normal to gossip and share rumors.
 

 
As for those without malice, they were individuals who could never compete with Tong Zhao, and since they had no grounds for envy, they merely felt pleased to flaunt their insider connections to friends, pretending to be well-informed and savvy—so-called “insiders.”
 

 
Such people are not uncommon; if one has a broad social circle, they can easily find such discussions in their friend group.
 

 
A shared photo, and in their words, “Isn’t that old X? We often hang out; if there’s a gathering, I’ll definitely be invited.” When a certain new movie is released, they express their feelings as if they shared an intimate friendship, while no one in their friend circle can truly validate the grandeur of their connections with that high-profile individual.
 

 
What happens when these people catch even a whiff of genuine gossip?
 

 
When they pry out even a morsel of real news from celebrities?
 

 
That’s something else.
 

 
Goodness, that could provide a year’s worth of conversation material.
 

 
From Shi Dingjun’s perspective, commenting on the recently pursued stars by film companies and directors, picking apart details, satisfied a portion of people’s hidden sense of superiority.
 

 
Shi Dingjun and the director were completely unaware of this.
 

 
After all, their original words were...
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 1 is a bit too extroverted and hard to rein in, you know? That kind of feeling makes the audience be unreasonably drawn to her, which is very useful during the film's climax, but if she stays like that throughout the entire film, it will be unbalanced. I’ve seen her in 'Countdown 72 Hours' and 'One Life Survivor,' and there are obvious structural issues in both; although 'Countdown' is labeled as a movie, it actually has a heavy component of live variety show.”
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 2 is not as indulgent as the first time; she’s much more restrained.”
 

 
—“Each version of Tong Zhao has particular points that fit perfectly with Xie Guiya. I want them all! I really want to film with her! However, doing so would pose difficulties in production and objectively increase costs; I wonder if her subconscious changes can remain stable…”
 

 
That disdain and frustration are the happy troubles of someone who is too good at everything.
 

 
It’s a kind of Versailles-style complaint.
 

 
After reaching a consensus with the director, he made a phone call to have Tong Zhao, who was drinking tea in the lounge, return to wait for the official filming to begin. He clearly expressed his thoughts, hoping she could cooperate with his immature concept: “Let’s put it this way, this lead role feels like it has to be you. I hope you can keep this schedule, but I’m also filming like this for the first time, which is quite risky. I can afford to lose, but you may not be able to. If you discuss it with your agent and feel it’s not worth the risk and want to decline, that’s perfectly fine.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun spoke candidly.
 

 
He was a renowned director, with his last two films being very successful; no one would deny his status in the film industry due to one less successful innovation. He could afford to be a graceful loser.
 

 
Tong Zhao was an emerging female star, and every filming opportunity was precious.
 

 
Moreover, in the eyes of others, Director Shi's high-budget productions were bound to be successful. If his film flopped, it would also affect her reputation among the public and within the industry.
 

 
In others' eyes, Shi Dingjun's films were indeed a hot commodity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had many choices now and really didn’t need to take this risk; even shooting a historical drama would be a safer option.
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment, then smiled:
 

 
“I like your idea, Director Shi. As long as you dare to offer me the role of Xie Guiya, I will dare to take it.”
 

 
One of her characteristics was her willingness to take risks.
 

 
The two clicked immediately.
 

 
Tong Zhao happily sat in the van back home. After connecting with two different personalities during the holographic film shoot today, she felt a bit fatigued from switching back and forth like changing tapes. So, she lit a soothing aromatherapy candle, wrapped herself tightly in a blanket on the sofa, and dozed off for a bit. As a result, the scent of the new ebony and bergamot aromatherapy candle was just to her liking, and she ended up sleeping until evening, her memories of the audition refreshed.
 

 
Shuyi: [Wow, Duan Ge is so fierce.]
 

 
Duan Ge: 【The plot requires it; didn’t you hit him too? You’ve probably beaten up people during interviews before.】
 

 
Shuyi once disguised herself to infiltrate a whaling base in the East. Due to carelessness, she was discovered and had to take down the three people who found her—but at the time, she had very handy weapons and equipment since she was prepared for danger when she infiltrated.
 

 
Shu Yi: [Isn’t it reasonable for a reporter who must deal with ruthless criminals to know a bit of self-defense?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Hmm, a little bit.]
 

 
The two exchanged a knowing smile.
 

 
As Tong Zhao groggily made her way to the bathroom to wash her face, she listened to their quiet conversation in her mind, feeling particularly good.
 

 
One of the reasons for her good mood was the brand-new interpretation method proposed by Director Shi, which she found quite appealing—
 

 
She recalled what Director Shi had said:
 

 
“Tong Zhao, you can steadily switch between two states, could you use your second audition self for the first half, and for the second half... I need the explosive power and commanding presence you presented to me in the first audition!”
# Chapter82
Tong Zhao was particularly happy.
 

 
“A movie means double the experience; once it's finished, Zhao Zai should be able to come out.”
 

 
Ever since her head got caught in the door last time, Zhao Zai had given up her curious behavior of peeking around. Instead, Concubine Chen often came to tease her, like someone playing with a little seal at the zoo. Lu Xianzhang felt sorry for Zhao Zai, thankful that during her time as a concubine, she had never had children; otherwise, she would likely have ended up as someone who was played with by her own mother to pass the time.
 

 
Zhao Zai said she would challenge Concubine Chen when she came out.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “Jump up and hit my knees? I’m so scared.”
 

 
Tong Zhao patted essence on her face.
 

 
In fact, these effects were not as good as her practice in cultivation. Even just sitting quietly for an hour to absorb the essence of heaven and earth had better results than any beauty treatment. It was just that she enjoyed having all those bottles and jars in her bathroom, and the thrill of buying skincare products in bulk when they were on sale.
 

 
After finishing her skincare routine, Tong Zhao lay back in her massage chair, preparing to check on Ze Shan’s work progress.
 

 
Everything was going smoothly.
 

 
“Little Lamb Playmate” was being launched into the market step by step according to her planned publicity strategy. The high costs originally set aside for celebrity endorsements had been redistributed to hire various game streamers and video content creators to produce embedded advertisements.
 

 
“Is the opposing team’s support taking down the Wild King? Come to ‘Little Lamb Playmate’! You can find any king here and even listen to voice lines.”
 

 
In the gaming lobby, seeking help from the Wild King? By spending money on “Little Lamb Playmate,” you could enjoy the thrill of selecting a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao instructed that the app’s categories be more detailed; not only should the ranks be differentiated, but they could also be specified down to hero names as keywords—like if a boss wanted to learn to play the hero Yun Zhongjun, they could simply look for a top player specializing in Yun Zhongjun’s skills, ensuring they wouldn’t lead novices astray.
 

 
By the time others noticed the business opportunities in this field, it was already too late.
 

 
The players established fixed relationships with bosses in “Little Lamb Playmate,” and users were accustomed to spending money there.
 

 
Just this “habit” was worth its weight in gold.
 

 
Being the first to take the plunge had its advantages.
 

 
Tong Zhao calculated her earnings from “Little Lamb Playmate” and, satisfied, closed the app. She also reminded Wei Zekai: “Remember to prohibit any offline transactions and never arrange offline meetings through the app. Although many users want a local function, it’s too risky to open that up. If they want a casual encounter, they should find their partners in the private spaces instead of through our application.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Okay.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “What does blind box have to do with this?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “... It’s like instant local matchmaking; you add each other in the morning and meet in the afternoon without knowing what the other person looks like. That’s why it’s called a blind box.”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked shocked.
 

 
He had gained some useless knowledge.
 

 
Not really liking this method, he thought about what he wanted to say the most today: “By the way, a momentary failure doesn’t mean anything; you are the best.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I will always firmly choose you!”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If you don’t want to talk about this, I won’t say anything more. But I hope Tong Zhao knows that each of us at Ze Shan is your solid support, especially me.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Music Link: My Good Brother - Xiao Shenyang & Gao Jin]”
 

 
Tong Zhao accidentally clicked on the link, and the song began to play.
 

 
‘My good brother, if you have troubles, you tell me. When you need me, I will accompany you through it together.’ [Note]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “……… ”
 

 
She didn’t know what was wrong with this guy.
 

 
Just as she was about to ask, her manager called, telling her not to pay attention to the rumors outside and that the next opportunity would be even better.
 

 
Ten minutes earlier, Tong Zhao had felt quite pleased with herself.
 

 
Ten minutes later, her good friend and manager sent her comforting messages.
 

 
This left Tong Zhao puzzled.
 

 
But this wasn’t the first time; she clearly felt she was quite impervious to attacks, yet those around her seemed to feel distressed even when she bumped into something.
 

 
“First, explain what the outside rumors are about.”
 

 
“They said that you mentioned your subconscious has various forms and wanted to showcase them separately to Director Shi. Wasting two audition opportunities and still getting rejected, some things were said quite harshly. They said it’s ridiculous that you treat your unstable, distorted subconscious as a selling point in front of a big director. They won’t increase costs because of your instability; you really think too highly of yourself.”
 

 
Sister Chu paused and then comforted her, saying, “It’s just jealousy. Those who have achieved more than you and are currently more famous certainly wouldn’t think that way.”
 

 
However, Tong Zhao held the opposite view:
 

 
“If they really didn’t think that way, then the entertainment industry wouldn’t have the term ‘bomb-proof’.”
 

 
The cake is only so big.
 

 
If she gets a role, it inevitably means someone else loses a role.
 

 
Actors with subconscious-driven film roles generally have more rigid paths and typically only compete with similar types.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was an outlier; anyone could be threatened by her.
 

 
Right now, everything she acted in became a hit; no one wanted to clash with her ratings. As long as she expressed interest in acting… even if it was just a script without a production team, there would be investors willing to back her. What couldn’t be accomplished with money? Aside from directors of Director Shi’s caliber, there were plenty of directors wanting to collaborate with Tong Zhao. Shi Qianqiu was just sitting there and doing nothing, saying he didn’t want to shoot a new movie for the time being—unless Tong Zhao acted in it.
 

 
Sister Chu: “You have a point.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Others are fine with just one bowl of rice; you want to set a banquet at home.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed at this description.
 

 
Isn’t that right? She could indeed host a grand feast in her mind.
 

 
After laughing, Tong Zhao collected herself and said, “The main issue is that they got it wrong from the beginning. Where did they hear such false news? Director Shi has already settled on me. However, the increased costs need to be discussed with the investors. He was very confident in his tone, saying he has some influence with the investors and asked me to give him two days. He will definitely give me a response by Sunday.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s time was precious; she wouldn’t get stuck on a single project.
 

 
So, waiting two days was also a matter of giving Director Shi face.
 

 
Sister Chu felt happy for her after hearing this, but she was also puzzled—how did this rumor spread?
 

 
This was easy to investigate.
 

 
After all, a group of people were vividly claiming that they had personally heard Director Shi say it.
 

 
As it circulated, the final version morphed into a sensational story about how “the domineering little flower wanted to show off in front of the veteran director but ended up being eliminated instead,” which was very satisfying for those who spread it.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a phone call to ask the director himself. Director Shi was baffled, denied the rumors three times, and then told her the original words. He didn’t think she was making a big deal out of it; instead, he comforted her: “Stability in the subconscious is important. If this were your first performance, I might be worried, but your past performances have been so stable that I don’t need to worry at all! The audition effect you presented to me is worth the risk. You’re still young and new in the industry; too many people are envious of you. Such talk is normal, just wait for the official announcement.”
 

 
Director Shi had a good impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Moreover, since his master was quite fond of her, they might even have a future as fellow disciples, so he naturally was willing to say a few more words.
 

 
“By the way, do you have time the night after tomorrow? My master’s birthday is being celebrated at Ming Yun Restaurant, and I’d like to invite you to dinner. But it’s in Qin City… If you come, I will arrange for someone to pick you up.”
 

 
Taking the opportunity, Director Shi extended the invitation.
 

 
Tong Zhao checked her schedule; she had nothing planned for that day, so it would be a good chance to visit Qin City.
 

 
While enjoying peace and rest at home was nice, she also needed to get out and about.
 

 
One of the benefits of her quick-wear experiences was that she had endless energy and initiative. She didn’t need others to tell her what to do, nor did she require prompting; she would take the initiative to get things done and would find tasks to occupy herself with if there was nothing to do—she simply couldn’t sit still. Sister Chu often joked that among the artists she managed, Zhao Zhao was the one who needed the least coaxing. When the schedule was set, and she called to confirm, the answer she always received was full of energy, along with a readiness to go out at any time.
 

 
That’s why she was the most cherished by her.
 

 
“Okay, then I’ll see you the night after tomorrow.”
 

 
Once Tong Zhao settled this, she told Sister Chu not to schedule any other work for her in the meantime.
 

 
She also sent a message to that overly worried guy: “Don’t overthink it; I wasn’t eliminated. The role is mine now.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “ [Surprised expression of the host holding open their eyelids with two fingers.jpg]”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Snape clapping meme.jpg]”
 

 
…This guy's collection of memes was truly unfathomable.
 

 
After hanging up, Sister Chu suddenly realized something was off. The old curator’s birthday?
 

 
She checked, and historically, the old curator's birthday was a star-studded event, especially for those who had acted in action films. No one would dare to offend him. However, in the past, it had never been grand; he only invited his disciples and familiar faces. This year marked his sixtieth birthday, and they were preparing for a big celebration at Ming Yun Restaurant.
 

 
Ming Yun Restaurant was also a prestigious place.
 

 
It was the highest-rated restaurant in Qin City, and many celebrities and wealthy businessmen chose to host banquets on the top three floors.
 

 
It wasn’t just a simple birthday celebration for a friend!
 

 
Sister Chu was speechless and more anxious than Tong Zhao herself. She hurriedly booked the best stylist and formal wear she could find on short notice, determined to dress her up beautifully. There would be reporters and other film stars on site, and once the photos hit the streets, who would dare say Director Shi looked down on her?
 

 
Tong Zhao was clearly informed about the arrangements, while her manager was already starting to take out loans to prove a point.
 

 
She didn’t feel much about it; her manager said, “If they can mock with loans, why can’t I enjoy myself with one? They talk as if it’s true; Director Shi is on good terms with our Zhao Zhao!”
 

 
Tong Zhao found this line of reasoning a bit strange.
 

 
But it was no wonder Sister Chu was angry. The confidentiality of the auditions that day was not very high, and once rumors started circulating, they spread like wildfire. Some were screenshot and shared within small circles of friends, eventually landing in the hands of marketing accounts, presented as half-truths.
 

 
@Guajie Breaks the News:
 

 
Guess who this female star is?
 

 
[Content of the screenshot from the Moments: “I can’t help but say this is too funny ! When I went to the audition today, I encountered Director Shi auditioning for ‘The Knives of the Maiden' and overheard a scoop… A certain female star who debuted a year ago claimed her subconscious was very special and wanted two audition chances. In the end, she didn’t make it after trying twice . The director and the supervisor said she was too unstable, which would increase costs.”]
 

 
Comments on Moments:
 

 
“Really? Who is it?”
 

 
Reply: “TZ (in a low voice)”
 

 
“Wow, didn’t she say she rejected a lot of scripts? Is she just waiting for this one? It’s so unfortunate to be eliminated.”
 

 
Reply: “I think the director doesn’t like her being too dramatic. If she had auditioned well, maybe she’d still have a chance.”
 

 
These snarky screenshots from Moments were like water hitting a hot oil pan; they exploded.
 

 
It was too easy to guess.
 

 
The points about being in the industry for a year and subconsciousness, coupled with the initials, were practically the same as naming her outright.
 

 
[TZ can only be Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[It’s normal to fail an audition once; is it necessary to be so sarcastic? She didn’t use this to promote herself.]
 

 
[Can’t her fans just stop being so smug?]
 

 
[Hmm, it’s probably because saying the truth sounds like bragging; a niche reality show blew up, and a leading lady film broke records on its opening day, but now she’s being buried in the ground after one failed audition… I’m just speaking the truth for some jealous folks; no need to thank me!]
 

 
In the entertainment industry, whether fans or haters, everyone was a super big gossip monger.
 

 
The comments and shares became chaotic, and occasionally an uninformed bystander would wander in, noticing countless mentions of the name in the hot comments, yet there were still people asking—
 

 
[Who are you all talking about? Why do you all look like you know what's going on?]
 

 
Good grief, they’re jumping from Bilibili to Weibo, wanting the gossip served to them on a platter, even saving the effort of chewing.
 

 
Bystanders are just enjoying the show, while fans are genuinely invested.
 

 
The battle between fans and haters in the comments of this Weibo post, coupled with Tong Zhao's increased fame following the Li Zhi TV gala, has led many to pay attention to what role she would take next. Fans were eagerly looking forward to her breaking new records, but instead, they got the news that she turned down many scripts and failed auditions, which must have been disappointing.
 

 
If it were just a private disappointment, that would be one thing.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao had only debuted for a short while, her foundation was solid, and among her fanbase, many top-tier fans wouldn't just run away after a small setback.
 

 
However, being exposed to the sunlight felt entirely different.
 

 
But thinking about it, with Tong Zhao’s current popularity, it was impossible for her to just quietly fade away. Countless pairs of eyes were watching her; if she stumbled, people would gather around to share the news, loudly announcing to the entire fan community: Tong—Zhao—has—fallen!
 

 
After a day of noise, no serious figure had stepped up to speak out.
 

 
That made sense, though; during auditions, there were too many voices. When it came time to decide who would play the lead role, it was a discussion between higher-ups and investors, and irrelevant people couldn't possibly hear it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious and wanted to post on Weibo to throw down the gauntlet.
 

 
Wasn’t it just arguing?
 

 
Although he wasn’t good at being sarcastic, he was still a seasoned gamer from Zu'an, capable of handling pressure and taking the blame like a veteran!
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped him: "If you step out, people really won’t care about my audition anymore; they’ll just think I've been officially announced."
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t understand: "Isn’t an official announcement a good thing? Didn’t Director Shi book you?"
 

 
"It's not about the movie announcement,"
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed: "It's about our relationship being announced."
 

 
This statement successfully stopped Wei Zekai’s impulsive behavior.
 

 
A day later, an entertainment news piece was released by Sina Entertainment.
 

 
“Tong Zhao Appears at Director Deng’s 60th Birthday Banquet”
 

 
Subsequently, many credible entertainment accounts released:
 

 
“Director Shi and Tong Zhao Enjoy a Happy Conversation? Mrs. Shi: A particularly spirited young girl.”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s simple yet elegant appearance stuns everyone; Director Shi clarifies the rumors.”
 

 
“Official Announcement of the Female Lead in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’!”
 

 
The agent, who had been holding in a surge of anger, especially used her connections this time to ensure a photographer at the event took a flattering picture of Tong Zhao—this was incredibly easy for reporters, as Tong Zhao was already a somewhat famous beauty in the industry with no bad angles. It would take a lot of effort and skill to get a bad photo of her; they would need to amp up their techniques to get even an average shot.
 

 
In short, each piece of news was tacitly accompanied by a photo of Tong Zhao sitting next to the old director and his wife, surrounded by her senior brothers and sisters. She wore an elegant gray gown adorned with eagle feathers, her long hair styled up, revealing her graceful swan neck and beautifully defined shoulders...
 

 
Sister Chu put in a lot of effort; she certainly wouldn’t let her agent's hard work go to waste.
 

 
Throughout the event, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of a regal beauty, successfully capturing a multitude of camera shots.
 

 
Once the news broke...
 

 
It was as if the haters who had been shouting, “Can you beat my 17 cards?” were suddenly swept away by a massive bomb and a plane, all accompanied by joyful sounds of a suona!
# Chapter83
What on earth is going on?
 

 
Forget about the haters and bystanders; even the fans, who should have first-hand information, are at a loss and can only rush to share in the fan groups, hoping to get clarification from the fans with better sources.
 

 
Both the fans and the haters are confused.
 

 
Many of the well-informed fans and studio leaders collaborate with entertainment companies, achieving mutual benefits and collectively reaping profits, aiming for a goal of shared prosperity.
 

 
Tong Zhao's contract with the company is quite flexible. She has also emphasized to her manager that she does not want to follow the idol route, so her fans naturally formed on their own without the need for deliberate cultivation—
 

 
Thus, Tong Zhao's fan base has a relatively average fighting capacity.
 

 
Unless provoked by someone else, they will never rush to respond.
 

 
Some in the fandom feel that Tong Zhao's camp lacks the right atmosphere and doesn’t have that sought-after flavor of the domestic entertainment industry. However, Tong Zhao's fandom is also one of the more comfortable ones for outsiders to support, as they don’t focus rigidly on album sales or engage in various messy voting schemes, while also dabbling in other fields that occasionally surprise fans.
 

 
With pros come cons, and Tong Zhao is quite satisfied with the current state of affairs.
 

 
Overall, it’s just fine. She isn’t planning a rebellion or preparing private troops, nor does she want to be the leader of a crab cult that unifies the world for generations.
 

 
During the fans' period of confusion, they noticed that Director Shi followed Tong Zhao—
 

 
@Shi Dingjunv:
 

 
"Welcome the lead actress of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and our little junior sister @Tong Zhao!"
 

 
[Audition Screenshot 1.JPG][Audition Screenshot 2.JPG]
 

 
……
 

 
[So she really became a junior sister? Congratulations to Director Shi.]
 

 
[Oh my gosh, a plot twist??? So the marketing accounts were spreading fake news??? @Guajie, come out and get beaten up.]
 

 
[Wasn’t it said that she had high aspirations and used her unique subconscious as a gimmick, and that she got scolded by you??? How did she turn around??? Did she ultimately bow to capital???]
 

 
This is a suggestion that Tong Zhao has capital backing her.
 

 
Even though she had publicly distanced herself from the Tong family long ago and retained her surname simply because it shares a character with her mother’s, she had also cut ties with Tong Zhenming and had a reputation that was not merely damaged, but practically shattered. If she wasn’t stepped on, it would be a stroke of luck; how could anyone help her? But she also has a wealthy and unattainable rumored boyfriend, Wei Zekai, along with the entertainment company behind her.
 

 
Conspiracy theories never go out of style.
 

 
There are no absolutes in this world; from another perspective, it’s a good thing for the public to remain vigilant.
 

 
Shi Dingjun responded directly to this comment: "After the audition, I planned to finalize Tong Zhao. However, because we intended to use a special filming method, it would increase certain costs, so I needed to discuss it with the investors. They ultimately strongly supported my decision. I only heard about this rumor today; I was too busy preparing for the master’s birthday and the new movie... That rumor has been false since I first trained her; it’s all misinformation."
 

 
To increase his credibility, Shi Dingjun even posted a comment with a picture.
 

 
It was a record of his WeChat conversations with Tong Zhao, clearly showing that they added each other as friends on the morning of the audition. After the audition, they chatted for a bit, and the conversation was filled with appreciation. From the timing of their discussions, it was clear that any notion of capital pressure was nonexistent, and he liked Tong Zhao very much.
 

 
So where did the rumors come from?
 

 
Director Shi said it might have originated from the conversation he had with the supervisor after the audition. They both came from the same hometown and spoke a mix of dialect and Mandarin. Some people only understood part of the conversation and took it upon themselves to spread it as a serious rumor, which is quite unethical. He hopes the rumors can stop.
 

 
This blocked the last point of doubt.
 

 
Shi Dingjun has a great image, and his words carry weight more than anything else.
 

 
[It’s too funny to be a bystander during all this hhhhh]
 

 
[Got it, the end result of mocking with loans is getting slapped in the face.]
 

 
[A little bit of rumor-catching drew all the foolish haters out; I’d call it a skill.]
 

 
Fans who were previously anxious suddenly found their backbone.
 

 
In reality, being eliminated from the audition isn’t a big deal.
 

 
However, being publicly scolded by the well-liked and prominent Director Shi is quite an embarrassing black mark, and it’s likely to resurface in the future whenever there’s a dispute with other companies.
 

 
With the burden lifted, it’s time to settle accounts with the rumor mongers!
 

 
[Seriously, think about how awkward this is. How long have Director Shi and Tong Zhao known each other? If it were someone else, and there were all these rumors about that person badmouthing you behind your back, would you still consider them a friend? The rumor mongers have dirty hearts; I hope they get their mouths sewn shut in the future.]
 

 
The true source of the rumors is untraceable, but the origin of the sarcastic posts that really spread them is easy to find.
 

 
It was a minor role who didn’t leave after the audition that day, named Yun Zhiran. Her level of fame is only slightly different from that of a regular person; she had never landed an important role before, so just getting a minor role with lines in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ is a breakthrough for her.
 

 
Fans are itching to confront her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao first retweeted her thanks to Shi Dingjun and then posted a new Weibo update.
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
"I hope the audience can find joy in my work.
 

 
I hope my fans can draw positive energy from liking me; there’s no need to fight for me, and don’t hate or belittle others because of me. I will fight my own battles, and I will walk my own path. When I’m weary, you support me; when I’m weak, you encourage me; when I succeed, I can share it with you. That is enough."
 

 
This statement was calculated and well-considered.
 

 
Of course, fans need to be restrained. At the very least, she herself set the tone; even if they want to act out, it won’t be too outrageous. By nipping the signs of toxicity in the bud at the beginning, it can prevent things from spiraling out of control later—why are there so many instances of "bystanders wishing for her downfall, while fans wish nothing but for their idol to thrive"? Because short-sightedness for immediate gains set a bad precedent, and the fan groups that developed afterward resemble a high-speed car with malfunctioning brakes, completely out of control and impossible to rein in even by the idol herself.
 

 
Why not stop it?
 

 
Because the capital behind the idol has already earned its money, and there are very few young idols with the foresight and resources to reject toxic fan behavior from the start.
 

 
If you won’t support me, I’ll find someone else to lift up.
 

 
Why not support them?
 

 
After all, they’re just a fast-moving product that will only be popular for one or two years. If they lose control, they can just disappear from the entertainment industry with a fortune.
 

 
In this world, everyone is bustling for profit; the world is chaotic because of profit flowing away.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that her fans were excited, and it wouldn’t be good to harshly criticize them or pour cold water on their enthusiasm. So, she chose to give a more gentle hint, affirming the unwavering support her fans had shown her lately.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t afraid that her fans wouldn’t understand.
 

 
What is there for fans to misunderstand? Most people in the fandom have excellent reading comprehension skills.
 

 
[Got it, we won’t give our sister any trouble; good luck to her in her new drama! /Heart emoji [Tong Zhao cute expression pack.jpg]]
 

 
[Quietly waiting for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’; Sister looked so beautiful at the birthday banquet! [Edited high-quality photo.jpg]]
 

 
[We don’t spread hate / We’re cute, we also don’t belittle others / So happy, hope the rumor-mongering monsters stay away from our sister / Smile]
 

 
This sarcastic Weibo post and the three default expressions show the repressed anger of some of the more combative fans, warning certain competitors who can’t stand Tong Zhao’s success and bored haters to focus on their own happy lives and not bother them anymore.
 

 
After Tong Zhao posted on Weibo, she glanced at the comments, knowing it was enough that her mainstream fans had received her message.
 

 
After all, a celebrity's fanbase influences each other.
 

 
She found it quite interesting to look at the comments on her Weibo.
 

 
If only everyone would talk without constantly posting her photos, it’s a bit too brainwashing; she had become numb to it and was starting to lose the ability to discern her own beauty from ugliness.
 

 
After soothing her fans, Tong Zhao didn’t intend to suffer insults without reason.
 

 
She directly told Director Shi to remove Yun Zhiran from her role, with a ready-made justification—someone who spreads half-truths and rumors clearly has questionable character. Moreover, if she has such strong opinions about the lead, what if that hatred unconsciously affects her and leads to a big problem during filming, like stabbing the lead with a knife? A minor role can be easily swapped out.
 

 
The director’s reply was: “Actually, I was already planning to cut her anyway.”
 

 
After all, half of this rumor was pinned on him, which was quite unfair.
 

 
When Yun Zhiran received the news that she had been temporarily cut from the role, she was momentarily stunned. Putting together the current events, she guessed it had something to do with Tong Zhao—she believed that Director Shi wouldn’t hold a grudge against a young girl; it had to be a case of women making things difficult for each other. It was just like how she felt a sense of secret joy when she heard that Tong Zhao had “failed” the audition and was eager to have more people witness her downfall. Yun Zhiran managed to obtain Tong Zhao's work WeChat through some minor methods, hoping to apologize and plead for mercy.
 

 
When she saw Yun Zhiran send a long string of messages, Tong Zhao felt not a single ripple of emotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Firstly, I don’t have much say in casting decisions; changing actors is not my responsibility. I’m sorry you lost this role, but I don’t know much about the related matters. If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Then, she blacklisted Yun Zhiran.
 

 
Whether it was a phone call or WeChat, there was always a risk of being screenshot or recorded. Tong Zhao was in the right and wasn’t afraid of a dispute.
 

 
However, she didn’t plan to get entangled in endless disputes with a minor role; it would be too embarrassing. If this were a TV drama, this minor character would only be a brief interlude to adjust the pacing; wanting the lead to interact with them for three or four episodes? They’d need at least a top star for that!
 

 
Yun Zhiran felt a tightness in her chest from Tong Zhao’s last line: “If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Because she had mocked Tong Zhao in her social circle with the line, “It’s the director who doesn’t like her being too dramatic; if she auditions well, there might still be opportunities,” now that the same words were thrown back at her, Yun Zhiran felt like she was having a heart attack. Tong Zhao guessed correctly; she indeed wanted to argue with Tong Zhao. By stirring up controversy, she could gain heat and attention. Unfortunately, Tong Zhao didn’t fall for it and remained calm, which made her uncomfortable.
 

 
As she was about to say something, she received a red exclamation mark.
 

 
Yun Zhiran: “…?”
 

 
Did she just get blacklisted?
 

 
No rebuttal?
 

 
No insults?
 

 
Yun Zhiran had also mocked her on Weibo.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had previously stated not to engage in such antics, the fans who came to her defense were few, and passersby quickly forgot about it. After all, they weren't on the same level; they only knew that Tong Zhao quickly clarified the rumors against her and publicly showcased a great resource, gaining the endorsement of credible figures in the industry and maintaining an excellent image…
 

 
That bit of negative impact dissipated silently.
 

 
At that moment, the criticism Yun Zhiran faced was significantly smaller than the wave of collective mockery directed at Tong Zhao that had arisen after her rumors.
 

 
Spreading rumors felt good at the moment, but when the backlash came, she realized how painful it could be.
 

 
In an instant, Yun Zhiran understood.
 

 
This complete disregard from Tong Zhao truly made her uncomfortable—enjoying fabricating rumors behind someone’s back? That’s fine; just focus on being a rat in the gutter and don’t come prancing in front of her. She wasn’t worthy.
 

 
After Tong Zhao blacklisted Yun Zhiran, she completely removed that name from her mind.
 

 
Just a nobody.
 

 
What mattered more was her reputation.
 

 
This was something her agent and her company had been striving for—
 

 
They didn’t expect to mold Tong Zhao into a flawless person, but if the dirt thrown at the “Tong Zhao” brand was false, they needed to wash it away as much as possible. Fortunately, as Tong Zhao had said, there was no need to escalate it into a messy war of words… After being properly “soothed,” the fans’ anger significantly decreased, and the keywords in their comments shifted from aggressive terms like “rumor-mongering dogs,” “haters,” and “anti-explosion” to a focus on the new drama and Tong Zhao’s appearance at the curator’s birthday banquet.
 

 
Many people on Director Shi’s Weibo were asking what this new filming method that would increase costs was all about.
 

 
Director Shi smiled and said he had to keep it a secret for now.
 

 
But surely they could talk about Tong Zhao becoming their little junior sister?
 

 
Not only did Shi Dingjun generously mention it, but some videos from the birthday banquet also leaked, and many attendees proudly showcased it on Weibo. Sister Chu thought correctly; that night, many important figures from the film industry and political circles gathered, especially since the old curator had made significant contributions to martial arts in China. Those involved in this field had some historical connections; in short, it was no small matter.
 

 
Tong Zhao's careful preparation had not gone to waste.
 

 
Considering this wasn’t a fashion show, being too deliberate would invite ridicule. The stylist chose a subtle and elegant high-grade gray outfit, and her long hair, tied in a ponytail, lessened the formality of the gown while emphasizing a youthful vibe appropriate for her age.
 

 
Many photos with Tong Zhao ended up in the news.
 

 
The fans happily basked in her beauty, putting aside the unpleasantness.
 

 
After all, the sister said she wanted to bring them positive influence.
 

 
Being a fan should be fun!
 

 
Tong Zhao, dazzling with the aura of Consort Chen, managed to handle all the scheming behind the photos where only she was edited in, as no amount of editing would work unless they made her look ugly—then it would be too obvious and would lead to endless mockery from the all-seeing netizens.
 

 
Other female stars also attended the birthday banquet, ready with their glamorous press releases...
 

 
But they seemed a bit unconvincing!
 

 
Especially for those who shared the frame with Tong Zhao; only their own fans could praise them with their eyes closed, while passersby looked on with a face full of “Emmm…”
 

 
Consort Chen felt quite wronged.
 

 
Consort Chen: “I’m just a tool for Zhao Zhao to shine in the spotlight.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Youth fades, but affection has already withered, wuwuwu…”
 

 
Seeing her pretend to cry while covering her face, Tong Zhao was speechless.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m afraid if I let you out for a moment, the sect will turn into a fish pond later.”
 

 
Consort Chen blinked her beautiful and innocent eyes as if asking her: “What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that everything was wrong.
 

 
Because after talking with Elder Deng, when he proposed to take her as his last disciple, the atmosphere was very warm and serious.
 

 
Director Deng explicitly mentioned that he saw her as a good candidate for martial arts, and her subconscious in “One Life Survivor” exhibited a kind of decisive aura that all his disciples lacked... reminiscent of his comrades from his fighting days. When Director Deng was young, he was part of the effort to defend the country, and he admired her particularly: “It would be a shame not to join the military.”
 

 
After a moment of thought, Director Deng added, “Actually, not all disciples are lacking, but those that are, didn’t survive.”
 

 
The disciples he took in their thirties all died on the battlefield.
 

 
The following thirty years witnessed the rapid development of China.
 

 
So, his gaze toward Tong Zhao was filled with nostalgia.
 

 
Aside from Director Deng’s pure fondness for her, the other senior brothers’ friendliness toward her was polite and somewhat distant, knowing she was about to star in Shi Dingjun’s film. Their conversations revolved entirely around the movie. Tong Zhao keenly observed that this sect resembled the Jewish community in Hollywood, supporting younger members and exchanging benefits... Action movies are one of the more profitable genres, and nearly ninety percent of the excellent action films on the market in Huaxia come from Director Deng’s disciples, who wouldn’t be willing to share this cake with outsiders.
 

 
However, there were very few female disciples under Director Deng, making Tong Zhao a low-threat, high-value new member for them.
 

 
From the news and the public’s perspective, Tong Zhao, surrounded by admirers while sitting next to Director Deng, appeared to be the “darling of the group.”
 

 
But at the core, Tong Zhao understood very well…
 

 
This was yet another venue for exchanging benefits, and she had inadvertently obtained a ticket to enter.
 

 
Just like in more traditional settings, there were always the remnants of drinking culture, but no one forced her to drink and no one made vulgar jokes at her expense. Because she was recently very popular and was expected to become even more so, there were no handles or black spots to use against her. Her demeanor constantly emphasized that she did not intend to leverage her beauty to gain anything...
 

 
After a few rounds of drinks, Tong Zhao assisted the elderly director’s wife into a car and remained sober.
 

 
She sat in the nanny van and took out her phone to check the online response.
 

 
The atmosphere was anything but calm.
 

 
In the world of showbiz, one had to keep fighting every day.
 

 
Fans' excited emotions were calmed down; there was no widespread online outrage, and the trolls quickly fell silent. Some even turned their attitudes 180 degrees and angrily criticized the rumor mongers—ironically, the ones who cursed the most fiercely were not Tong Zhao's fans but those who had initially followed the trend to mock her, only to realize they had been slapped in the face.
 

 
Some trolls showed traces of being backed by other groups, and their operations were not clean enough, leaving behind evidence that was noted down.
 

 
Tong Zhao only recognized some names as fellow actresses of the same age group.
 

 
Their faces were blurred, and she had little impression of them.
 

 
The malice directed at her was overwhelming.
 

 
However, this was not a personal grudge; if she accumulated more mocked history, it could indeed tarnish her currently glittering crown for a while.
 

 
The assistant who flew with her to Qin City handed her a thermos: “Sister Zhao, you didn’t eat much at the birthday banquet, did you? Do you want to drink something?”
 

 
Tong Zhao unscrewed the cap, revealing steaming hot chicken soup inside.
 

 
Due to her cultivation practice and good fitness habits, she didn’t pay much attention to her diet. At this moment, she was indeed hungry, so she smiled and thanked her assistant, then lowered her head to sip the chicken soup in small gulps. The rich and fragrant soup soothed the slight turmoil stirred up by the online chaos—
 

 
It was over.
 

 
Whether in reality or the online farce, everything had temporarily come to a close...
 

 
Not so fast!
 

 
Reality does influence the subconscious, so before filming began, Tong Zhao had to stay in Qin City to learn all the martial arts that might be used in “The Knives of the Maiden.” She didn’t aim to master them; at the very least, she wanted to keep the concepts in her mind, which was a kind of “skill” in the film industry, proven to be somewhat helpful.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao’s role in “The Knives of the Maiden” was a done deal, the focus of fans and reporters shifted to—
 

 
Since learning martial arts is so difficult, will she study hard?
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Save the children.”
 

 
Duan Ge: "Okay."
 

 
Shuyi: "Do I also need to learn together?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It's decided. You will take turns sitting in the main character's position, and I'll be in charge of supervision."
# Chapter84
Amateur martial arts practice isn’t hard.
 

 
It’s a very good way to strengthen the body.
 

 
However, starting from a young age is different.
 

 
First, let’s mention that the pain of having a master help you stretch your muscles is deeply ingrained in one’s memory.
 

 
The so-called training comes from the heart, and it is a tedious and painful process that comes from within—like holding a horse stance; can you find joy in that? It’s much harder than lifting weights or doing cardio in a gym. So when Tong Zhao reported to the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy, her senior martial artists in the academy reminded her to never show off in front of Director Deng. If she couldn’t endure it, she must speak up…
 

 
“Just a few years ago, a wealthy businessman who loved collecting antiques and revered traditional Chinese culture used his connections to spend a lot of money to send his grandson here to study martial arts. He wanted the best, and we told him that Director Deng is strict and that following him would definitely be tough, so it would be better to choose some senior brothers who are higher up in the ranking, who are a bit younger and known to be more lenient, knowing that young people can’t handle it,” the sixth senior brother shook his head and sighed. “But that rich man was undeterred and insisted on getting the best. He asked me…”
 

 
Tong Zhao was curious: “What did he ask?”
 

 
The sixth senior brother replied, “He asked if Director Deng had a different price.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
The sixth senior brother was forty this year and had a reliable and honest appearance, making it hard for Tong Zhao to judge if he was joking about Master Deng. He continued, “As a result, the kid was stubborn and refused to admit he was struggling, so Master didn’t really push him to the limit. It was just too tough, and the kid found a chance to sneak back home, saying he didn’t want to come back.”
 

 
“He complained to his parents and caused trouble for the martial arts academy?”
 

 
“Not really,” the sixth senior brother sighed. “The rich man thought his child couldn’t handle the hardship. Director Deng began to doubt his teaching methods were outdated. After that, he refused to accept any more students through connections until he saw you, junior sister…”
 

 
“Master said he was initially impressed by your fighting scenes in the variety show, and later, when he watched the earlier episodes, he found out you could endure hardships very well.”
 

 
“What did he notice specifically?”
 

 
Having heard a lot of flattery from fans, Tong Zhao wanted to know how Director Deng, such an important figure, appreciated her.
 

 
The sixth senior brother appeared more embarrassed: “Those instant noodles without seasoning packets.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao's respect for her master slightly declined.
 

 
In the bustling city of Qin, the martial arts academy felt like a paradise amid a concrete jungle, with a purely traditional Chinese-designed courtyard that was quite elegant. Master Deng and some of his core disciples lived here. Daily expenses came from tuition fees from apprentices and occasional offerings from disciples. Master Deng himself had a substantial fortune, which clearly indicated that he wasn’t short on money.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood that part of this “offering” was a return for Director Deng’s help in connecting her to good resources in the film industry.
 

 
In traditional films, the fighting scenes are judged by the actors; in instinctive films, they are judged by the action designers.
 

 
An excellent action designer is the soul of an action movie; the actors are just puppets controlled by them. Shi Dingjun was not satisfied with filming a puppet, which is why he favored Tong Zhao, who could perform incredibly well without needing action design coding.
 

 
“Master, I’ve brought my junior sister over.”
 

 
As they passed the indoor training hall, the shouting faded away.
 

 
After crossing a picturesque bridge with flowing water, they arrived at a wooden door.
 

 
“Let her in; you go on with your work.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother complied.
 

 
Thinking that Director Deng preferred Duan Ge and that martial arts practice was hard…
 

 
Cough!
 

 
Whether or not she practiced martial arts wasn’t important; what mattered was her respect for the elder.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay, you can go rest now.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Alright!”
 

 
Tong Zhao bounced around like Nobita from "Doraemon" asking for help.
 

 
Although she seemed very mature in front of others, in front of “herself,” she was always that childish kid fantasizing, “If only there were another me to go to school and do homework while I could just play.”
 

 
Duan Ge walked into the study and saw the energetic Director Deng writing calligraphy, just finishing the last character.
 

 
What was he writing?
 

 
A treasure for women?
 

 
Duan Ge took a closer look.
 

 
Oh, it turned out to be “A Warm Welcome.”
 

 
Director Deng smiled and invited her to sit, chatting with her about the operations of the martial arts academy.
 

 
“One month doesn’t really teach much; in the past, it would have just been basic practice. But it can’t be helped; your time is precious,” he said, his tone a bit helpless and annoyed, like he was jealous of fame and fortune. He knew that even though Tong Zhao was a great talent, he wouldn’t be able to keep her by his side to teach her: “The master only hopes that after you finish filming Xiao Jun’s movie, you’ll have time to practice what I taught you. Just don’t forget everything; you’ll need it in the future.”
 

 
Even though he had a high status in the industry and was usually respected, Director Deng didn’t put on airs. Instead, he genuinely treated Tong Zhao as a beloved junior: “When you came, Xiao Liu mentioned the incident where I scared my little disciple back home, right? It really wasn’t that bad; if you had just talked to me, I could have worked something out with you.”
 

 
When mentioning this, Director Deng seemed a bit troubled:
 

 
“I’ll teach you everything you need to know. Do you want me to teach you in a way suitable for a disciple, or do you just want to cover the basics for the sake of the movie? Don’t be afraid and don’t force yourself; just be honest.”
 

 
By the end of it, the master who had nurtured many stars in the film industry looked like a wronged old man.
 

 
Duan Ge echoed something similar to what the wealthy businessman had said:
 

 
“I want the best; just hold me to the highest standards.”
 

 
Duan Ge's thoughts were simple and straightforward.
 

 
Director Deng is recognized as the most formidable figure in Chinese martial arts. It would be foolish to miss out on such a great opportunity to learn. What does hardship matter? Duan Ge’s daily routine is all about enduring hardship, and being able to stay peacefully in the palace of consciousness doesn’t suit her at all. That’s why when Tong Zhao underwent the consciousness test through the Instinct Film Association, she saw Duan Ge’s room piled high with survival resources, cramped and narrow… all remnants of the shadows from her previous experiences in a post-apocalyptic world.
 

 
Director Deng glanced at her: “Don’t force yourself.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ll know if I try.”
 

 
Only then did Director Deng turn to face her properly: “You need to get up at five-thirty every morning.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I can get up at five to make breakfast for you, Master.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this a reverse bargain?
 

 
Director Deng clearly didn’t expect his little disciple to make such a move: “That’s not really necessary…”
 

 
“Respect for my teacher is the right thing to do.”
 

 
Duan Ge has always been very clear about her relationships and is quite perceptive about people.
 

 
Director Deng truly cares for Tong Zhao, showing genuine affection for a promising junior in martial arts.
 

 
“Throw me a peach, I’ll return it with a plum.”
 

 
Director Deng stared at her for a while, suddenly less friendly, as if he didn’t dare to be too happy in advance. He snorted coldly and called the sixth senior brother in to help her choose a room, saying in a gruff voice, “If you’re just going to learn casually, you can stay in a nearby hotel and come over for five hours of class each day. It would be much easier.”
 

 
This expectation mixed with fear of being hurt…
 

 
It was like a girl who had been deceived by ten scumbags; one could see she was becoming more childlike with each passing day.
 

 
This was the first step to treating Tong Zhao like one of their own.
 

 
As Duan Ge stepped forward, she turned back and said, “From early morning to evening, Master, don’t worry about getting tired.”
 

 
Director Deng felt amused and snorted heavily again, secretly resolving to see the results tomorrow.
 

 
He truly intended to bring out the strictness he had shown to his previously accepted disciples and see how long this delicate little girl could hold on!
 

 
……
 

 
The sixth senior brother led Duan Ge to the dormitory area.
 

 
There weren’t many core disciples living in the martial arts academy, and the dormitory areas for female and male disciples were clearly separated. The female disciples were already few, and in recent years, the senior sisters had all moved out due to marriage and childbirth, so Duan Ge basically had the place to herself, even more comfortable than staying in a hotel suite…
 

 
Though it was called a dormitory, it felt more like a quaint resort.
 

 
After all, this place isn’t designed for profit by widely accepting disciples, so there’s no need for large dormitories.
 

 
It’s more like a prestigious mansion that has just a few too many grandchildren.
 

 
After Duan Ge chose her room, the sixth senior brother didn’t go inside due to the separation of the genders: “A cleaner will come every day to tidy up. If you don’t need it, just hang the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign outside the door. Flip it over, and it means ‘Please come in to clean,’” he added, thinking for a moment about what else to say. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in his head, and he comforted her, saying, “Master can be a bit childlike with those close to him, so don’t take it to heart. He treats his disciples very well.”
 

 
“Master said that today you should just get familiar with the environment, and learning will start tomorrow.”
 

 
Duan Ge smiled slightly.
 

 
She could, of course, distinguish between malicious difficulty and playful arrogance.
 

 
“I understand. Since Master arranged everything so thoughtfully, I should be grateful.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother breathed a sigh of relief, and his gaze toward her became even more affectionate.
 

 
At forty years old, with a daughter around Tong Zhao’s age who was off having fun in college, he could only express his paternal love through money transfers. Now, seeing his junior sister felt like looking at his daughter’s classmate, filled with the strange affection of a father.
 

 
His little junior sister was just too cute.
 

 
However, for some reason, after she met with Master, her demeanor suddenly changed.
 

 
She looked a bit fierce.
 

 
Thus, the sixth senior brother unconsciously thought Master had said something wrong, making his little junior sister unhappy—ever since the last time Master had taught a little disciple who couldn’t endure the hardship and ran back home, Master had been quite affected. After all, he could tell that Master genuinely liked that child…
 

 
Master also liked Tong Zhao.
 

 
Did he scare her off with his usual arrogance when they first met? The sixth senior brother sighed inwardly.
 

 
That’s why he offered such comforting words to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Duan Ge, who wasn’t scared at all, thought this environment was simply too good.
 

 
It was comfortable to stay here, and the sect had such pleasant conversations; she liked it here a lot.
 

 
Tong Zhao was truly deep in sleep this time. Unless Zeshan had something urgent to discuss or Sister Chu had official business with her, she didn’t want to be disturbed for anything else. It felt like she was on an extended vacation, resting in her consciousness palace, sorting through her past memories, filling in the gaps, and playing with Zhao Zai…
 

 
“Shouldn’t I be doing something that a female celebrity is supposed to do?”
 

 
Duan Ge turned around in her room.
 

 
Han Zhi gave her a suggestion: “A month of training might be too long. If you want to engage with fans, you could document your little training moments, like filming a Vlog.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Oh, I can tell you’re an old influencer just by the way you speak.”
 

 
Duan Ge asked both Master and Sister Chu for permission to film a Vlog via WeChat.
 

 
Master: “Sure. Deng.”
 

 
Master: “No one’s not around. Deng.”
 

 
According to the sixth senior brother, the “Deng” at the end was Master’s signature.
 

 
Master: “But you need to clarify the main mission of your visit to the martial arts school. Deng. [Muay Thai warning. (Panda head punching) gif]”
 

 
……
 

 
How should she put it……
 

 
Did she need to explain that the Muay Thai warning wasn’t used in that way?
 

 
But it didn’t seem wrong either.
 

 
The internal struggle between being fashionable and retro was definitely a reflection of Master himself.
 

 
After receiving approval, Duan Ge began filming her Vlog with Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
After filming for three minutes, Han Zhi couldn’t take it anymore: “Can I do it instead? I’m better at this.”
 

 
Duan Ge scratched her head and stepped aside.
 

 
When it came to filming, Shuyi and Han Zhi were the best.
 

 
However, once Shuyi started talking, her tone became strange: “Martial arts is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese nation. As time goes by, this ancient culture is gradually fading away… If we’re talking about the place where martial arts traditions are preserved the best, we cannot bypass the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center and Master Deng. Today, as a student, I have come to the martial arts center…”
 

 
In short, the documentary felt overly intense and not very feminine.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t used to being feminine; after stretching a bit in front of the full-length mirror, he started filming.
 

 
After putting on the mask, Han Zhi ran to the entrance of the center, re-recording some footage and editing the process of Tong Zhao arriving at the center.
 

 
Without a smartphone stabilizer, it was still a bit difficult to film.
 

 
The first night at the martial arts school was spent filming and editing with Han Zhi.
 

 
……
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
Arrived at the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center in the afternoon.
 

 
Little junior sister is all set!
 

 
PS: This trip doesn’t have an assistant following me; this Vlog was filmed while learning, so please bear with me.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t need to learn anything.
 

 
Doing this made him appear even more diligent.
 

 
This kind of self-promotion was his occupational habit; he did it effortlessly.
 

 
Under Tong Zhao’s Weibo, many fans were eagerly waiting for updates.
 

 
As soon as this new post came out, the number of comments visibly shot up from 0 to three digits, and after refreshing, it hit four digits.
 

 
The growth rate was comparable to real estate prices.
 

 
You just think about how to be clever, and suddenly, the front row turns into the back row.
 

 
The video wasn’t long, just five minutes, briefly introducing the martial arts school and her living arrangements.
 

 
Han Zhi had a strong sense of the camera, making the short video feel like a professional promotional film; once the filter was applied, the fans couldn’t believe their sister had filmed it.
 

 
[Your sister did such a great job! So talented and versatile!]
 

 
[Already at the location? Are you going to train for a month? Sounds tough…]
 

 
[Even during the traditional film era, your sister must have been a particularly hard-working actress.]
 

 
Originally, it was just meant to be filmed for promotion, but unexpectedly, after Shi Dingjun saw it, he contacted her via WeChat and asked if she would be interested in turning the month-long training into a video. He had always wanted to shoot some short clips to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center but had never found a good opportunity. Today, seeing her film the martial arts school in such a relatable way, he knew it could definitely appeal to a younger audience.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “I’m not looking to profit from this; I just want more young people to know about our martial arts school.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “If you’re willing, I can arrange for a photographer from my team to come and assist you in filming the videos.”
 

 
……
 

 
Han Zhi, who really just wanted to do some promotion: "..."
 

 
Thinking about it, it didn't seem like a bad idea!
# Chapter85
Han Zhi agreed to it.
 

 
Shi Dingjun was very efficient and sent the photographer that same evening.
 

 
According to him, Xuanxuan was a particularly hardworking girl, and it was fine to let her sleep on a folding bed. This wasn’t meant to be harsh; if she was going to follow Tong Zhao around for 24 hours for filming, it would be more convenient for them to share a room. Finding a female photographer was also for this reason.
 

 
Xuanxuan was very willing.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t want to impose on the girl like this, so he went to discuss adding a bed in the room with Sixth Senior Brother. Since the suite provided for the junior sister was quite large, having one more person wouldn’t make it feel cramped.
 

 
Han Zhi: “If it’s going to be 24-hour filming, then I can’t do it. Duan Ge, you come back.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “By the way, are the class hours split evenly between me and Shuyi? Who goes first?”
 

 
For a full 24 hours, the two personalities would be divided.
 

 
Shuyi: “You go first.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why so polite with me?”
 

 
Shuyi: “I just don’t want to get up early…”
 

 
With this simple statement about not wanting to wake up early, the conversation suddenly felt more real.
 

 
Before Han Zhi left the main personality position, he discussed filming ideas with the photographer, Xuanxuan, for half an hour. After reaching a consensus, he let Duan Ge take back control of the body. She stretched her neck a bit and heard Xuanxuan excitedly ask, “By the way, I need to film you getting up every day, so I’ll need to wake up earlier than you. What time does Sister Zhao plan to wake up?”
 

 
Her smile was full of excitement, with a rosy glow on her fair cheeks.
 

 
Oh my.
 

 
She was going to film Tong Zhao!
 

 
That was almost on the same level as the treatment given to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xuanxuan's lips curl up uncontrollably.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Five o’clock.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Xuanxuan’s smile suddenly faltered.
 

 
Xuanxuan: “Is, is it really that early...?”
 

 
“Yeah, I’ll get up early to make breakfast,” Duan Ge asked with concern, “Can you not make it?”
 

 
Thinking she might be replaced, Xuanxuan quickly shook her head.
 

 
"I can get up, don’t worry, it’s no problem at all!"
 

 
Duan Ge gave a light "mm" in response: “Get some rest early tonight.”
 

 
During the apocalypse, entertainment was almost nonexistent. Physical books were unexpectedly precious; later, her survival base found a large number of books in a warehouse—most likely from a bookstore’s storage. Those books became something her subordinates eagerly borrowed. Therefore, Duan Ge had a low demand for entertainment and had long since given up the habit of using it, even in harsh environments.
 

 
At ten o’clock that night, when Xuanxuan still wanted to play on her phone for a while, she saw that Duan Ge had already covered herself with a blanket.
 

 
From her calm and steady breathing, it seemed she had fallen asleep.
 

 
…What a disciplined modern woman!
 

 
How could a modern person go to bed at ten o'clock without playing on their phone at all!
 

 
So impressive.
 

 
Of course, Xuanxuan already knew that Tong Zhao was very talented, but seeing her go to bed and fall asleep in seconds at ten o'clock made Xuanxuan's admiration rise to another level. Observing Tong Zhao's discipline, she felt embarrassed to continue playing on her phone. She obediently set a vibrating alarm for four-thirty and turned off her screen to sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
At four-thirty, Xuanxuan was jolted awake by the phone vibrating under her pillow for a second and quickly pressed the snooze button.
 

 
Once she shook off the grogginess of just waking up, a sense of accomplishment spread across her face.
 

 
She was up!
 

 
Fortunately, she had seen Sister Zhao go to sleep early last night, so she also seized the opportunity to rest. Otherwise, waking up this early would have been unbearable. Xuanxuan tiptoed out of bed and unexpectedly locked eyes with Duan Ge, who had already sat up in bed: "..."
 

 
Unlike her groggy, dazed expression, Duan Ge looked awake, her complexion slightly pale but her eyes bright and alert.
 

 
Wait, she had only just woken up a few seconds ago!
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ve noticed a problem.”
 

 
Xuanxuan stared at her blankly: “What is it, Sister Zhao?”
 

 
Duan Ge continued: “I’m the type who wakes up at the slightest sound of life nearby, so you won’t be able to capture me waking up to the alarm because I’ll be fully awake by the time you’re about ten steps away.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The photographer was even more dumbfounded.
 

 
She had considered many obstacles to filming, like a big star throwing a tantrum, and last night she had even been secretly relieved that Sister Zhao was easy to get along with and had specially arranged a large bed for her. She never expected that difficulties were waiting for her. She blurted out, “W-why is that?”
 

 
Duan Ge paused for a moment, omitting the cause and only stating the result: “When a person is sleeping, they are usually unguarded, right? I just feel it’s dangerous. Even if I try to convince myself that you’re not a threat, I will still wake up… it’s instinct.”
 

 
As the photographer considered probing further, she recalled the family scandal that had come to light about Sister Zhao.
 

 
She heard that Sister Zhao’s father was an abusive scumbag!
 

 
Growing up in such a cold and brutal family, it was only natural that her instincts would be sharper than most people’s. The photographer felt a surge of sympathy.
 

 
Not revealing someone’s scars is the most basic courtesy, so she immediately suppressed her inappropriate curiosity and quickly came to an understanding: “Okay, then can you lie back down and pretend to be asleep? I’ll get everything ready, and when your alarm goes off, you can pretend to wake up then.”
 

 
That was easy enough to do.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded and lay back down.
 

 
Startled by Sister Zhao, the photographer’s sleepiness vanished completely. She hurried to wash her face, brush her teeth, and change into comfortable clothes. Once she got the camera ready, she said, “I’m starting to film in three seconds.”
 

 
At five in the morning, it was still dark outside.
 

 
The alarm rang, and the bedside lamp gradually lit up. Duan Ge, who had been wide awake for a while, sat up in bed. The light from the bedside lamp cast a warm glow over her pale skin, making her look like the heroine in an art film. The photographer instantly understood why the famous director liked to film her so much—Shi Qianqiu was also notoriously picky about aesthetics on camera and had won many photography awards during college.
 

 
Even with no makeup, Sister Zhao looked beautiful!
 

 
Duan Ge looked at the camera and said in a hoarse voice, “Can you step outside and wait for me? I need to change clothes.”
 

 
The photographer quickly nodded and stepped outside.
 

 
She had mentally prepared herself for a long wait, but unexpectedly, within ten minutes, Duan Ge came out fully dressed.
 

 
Most people, after getting up and taking a morning shower, tend to daze off in the hot water, but Duan Ge wasn’t accustomed to that. She was very disciplined, taking what she called a “standard three-minute combat shower.” Afterward, she applied skincare products to her skin based on memory, using serums and moisturizers, all while getting dressed and doing her light makeup, resembling a well-trained robot.
 

 
The weather had turned a bit cold recently, with even lower temperatures in the morning.
 

 
From the photographer's perspective, Sister Zhao appeared in a black long-sleeve sports outfit, her hair tied in a high ponytail… Before coming to Qin City, her stylist had curled her hair, and now her ponytail had a graceful wave that softened the sharpness of her bangs that were all slicked back. She wore very light makeup; her long eyebrows framed her softly hazel eyes, which seemed to hold a distant, misty look.
 

 
Her fair skin glowed against the morning chill, giving her an air of cool detachment that left the photographer mesmerized.
 

 
“Let’s go.”
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her chin toward the photographer and walked straight ahead.
 

 
It was only then that the photographer, still taken aback by her understated beauty, snapped back to reality and quickly nodded to follow her.
 

 
Last night, Duan Ge had asked her sixth senior brother about Master’s meal arrangements.
 

 
The sixth senior brother said that everyone in the martial arts school ate in a common dining hall, and Master was no exception.
 

 
When the Master’s wife was in good health, she used to eat with him, but her health had deteriorated over the years. After forcing herself to attend Master’s sixtieth birthday banquet, she returned to the nursing home. Master was willing to take care of her, but given her condition required constant medical attention, it was inappropriate for her to stay at the martial arts school.
 

 
After learning about Master’s dietary preferences and restrictions, Duan Ge went to the kitchen to make chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles. She also made a cup of soy milk and prepared two meat buns from the kitchen. Since she had gone to bed early last night, she could have prepared more simple dishes beforehand, making it easy to get breakfast ready in the morning.
 

 
As for herself, she simply took some meat buns and plain porridge from the kitchen.
 

 
The photographer also grabbed some to eat.
 

 
The meat buns were stuffed generously with filling, and the juices soaked through the bun skin, making them particularly delicious.
 

 
Duan Ge lost count of how many she had eaten; she just continued until she was full.
 

 
…
 

 
After yesterday's meal with Tong Zhao, Director Deng had completely forgotten about her plan to wake up early to make breakfast for Master.
 

 
How could she possibly wake up on time?
 

 
He heard that Xiao Jun had arranged for her to have a photographer, hoping to get her up in the morning.
 

 
Director Deng didn’t think much of it and continued with his usual morning routine. Just as he was preparing to go to the dining hall for breakfast, the doorbell rang.
 

 
So early, who could it be?
 

 
A flicker of anticipation rose in Director Deng’s heart but was quickly suppressed.
 

 
“Who is it?”
 

 
He asked loudly while opening the door.
 

 
Behind the door stood his young disciple.
 

 
“Master, breakfast is ready.”
 

 
In an instant, Director Deng felt as if he had returned to twenty years ago...
 

 
Back then, the disciples he took in all adhered to such rules, doing everything they could to please their master.
 

 
As he grew older, he lost the desire to take on students.
 

 
The last time he accepted a disciple was ten years ago, and that experience had been quite dismal, almost like a reminder that his way of teaching was no longer in vogue.
 

 
Granddisciples were not as rewarding to instruct.
 

 
Director Deng had a bit of a craving to take in disciples again.
 

 
Seeing Duan Ge standing there, enveloped in the cold morning air, made Director Deng’s heart soften immensely.
 

 
The feeling was akin to that of a player in many online games who, after completing a system task, is given a disciple, only to be touched and embarrassed when the disciple presents them with thoughtful little herbal dishes or other items.
 

 
“Did you really go and get me breakfast? You didn’t need to go to all this trouble. What time did you wake up?”
 

 
Despite his effort to appear dismissive, the joy on Director Deng’s face was unmistakable as he accepted the tray. “Come in quickly. After I finish breakfast, we’ll head to the morning class—although the lesson is tailored to your performance needs, it’s a rare opportunity for the other disciples, so those interested will join in to learn. If anyone isn’t focused on martial arts, I’ll send them back to the second and third halls.”
 

 
The martial arts practice spaces were mostly spacious indoor areas.
 

 
The second and third halls were where ordinary disciples attended classes; the first hall was reserved for when Director Deng taught his disciples. Even though it had been years since he had needed it, he was reluctant to let anyone else use it, saying they could do as they pleased once he passed on.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t hold back and walked in with the photographer.
 

 
Han Zhi: “I just realized that Director Shi sending a photographer over is incredibly timely.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Hmm? How so?”
 

 
Shuyi: “With a month of one-on-one instruction, although Master is in his sixties, there could still be malicious speculation… Having a photographer present at all times can help extinguish any potential misunderstandings.”
 

 
After hearing their analysis, Duan Ge realized this aspect as well.
 

 
She could certainly sense Director Deng’s fondness for her; it was the affection an elder shows to a junior. However, many people would gladly wish for Tong Zhao’s downfall.
 

 
Duan Ge: “I need to gather evidence in advance for things I haven’t done.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, "This is exactly the kind of thing celebrities have to worry about for a lifetime. You wouldn’t believe how much reporters want you to get into trouble."
 

 
Director Deng finished his breakfast quickly.
 

 
After eating, he frowned, sensing something was off.
 

 
He had been eating the cafeteria chef's dishes for over ten years, and aside from the meat buns being at a familiar level, the chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles were typical Chinese breakfast items. However, as he ate, he noticed they tasted different from usual—much better than normal. The highlight was the soy sauce noodles, topped with a savory sauce made from diced pork stir-fried with seasonings. It was incredibly satisfying.
 

 
At that moment, Director Deng thought that Duan Ge had simply brought him the cafeteria's dishes.
 

 
Just this gesture was already enough to touch the master.
 

 
Director Deng ate quickly and then led her to a classroom.
 

 
The other disciples who had come to learn were sitting quietly in the corner, not daring to look too much.
 

 
After all, they were all young men in their prime, and Tong Zhao was a well-known beauty in the entertainment industry. They were afraid of embarrassing themselves by staring at her, and they certainly didn’t want to give the junior sister a bad impression of the sect, making her think that all the disciples were lecherous. So, before they arrived, they were sternly reminded to keep their focus on learning. If they were caught behaving inappropriately in front of their senior aunt, they would be sent back to the second and third halls and reprimanded!
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was personally taken in by Master Deng, she ranked higher in seniority than these disciples.
 

 
They should call her "Senior Aunt."
 

 
As soon as Director Deng entered the room, he waved for the boys to come over and greet her as "Senior Aunt."
 

 
So, under the watchful eyes of the camera and Duan Ge...
 

 
These boys, afraid of losing their resolve and being distracted by her beauty, kept their heads down, showing only their black hair as they took turns saying, "Good day, Master Deng! Good day, Senior Aunt!"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s persona didn’t have low emotional intelligence.
 

 
After all, this was one of her core traits.
 

 
Duan Ge was no exception; she could sense that these younger disciples were not entirely convinced about calling her "Senior Aunt," but under the authority of Master Deng, they had to comply.
 

 
Duan Ge raised an eyebrow.
 

 
Consort Chen: “One-on-one combat, smash them!”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I really suspect your palace intrigue skills refer to physical combat.”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied: “I’ve beaten my fair share of provocateurs, but I’d rather not dirty my hands myself; my hands are too delicate. Why not let the maids and eunuchs deal with it? Everyone has their specialties.” She said the most arrogant things in the sweetest tone.
 

 
The photographer was relieved to find that once she set up the camera, she could sit to the side and take a quick rest.
 

 
If nothing special happens, then she will just consider it a chance to catch up on sleep.
 

 
With her eyes closed, she doesn't love anyone!
 

 
Once the photographer set up the camera and got everything ready, she was so tired that her single eyelid looked like a double eyelid. She couldn’t help but sneak a glance at Duan Ge.
 

 
As a result, she found Duan Ge full of energy, doing warm-up exercises.
 

 
The photographer was speechless; indeed, one’s physical condition varies from person to person!
 

 
…
 

 
Having learned from the last time he took on a disciple, Director Deng didn’t dare to have too high expectations for Tong Zhao at the beginning. He started by teaching her the basics.
 

 
He not only taught her martial arts moves but also explained the meaning behind each technique.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao was listening intently, Director Deng felt reassured that he hadn’t misjudged her.
 

 
Because Director Deng was taking it easy, the other disciples found his class much less demanding than their usual lessons with their own master. Is this really the stern Master Deng they had heard about? It wasn't until Director Deng noticed that Tong Zhao was able to learn everything quickly that he gradually began to raise his expectations.
 

 
A week passed, and the other disciples began to struggle. They went to their master to say that the pace was too fast and requested that he give feedback to Master Deng to slow it down a bit.
 

 
Their master replied, "There’s nothing I can do. This was originally a private lesson for Tong Zhao. How much you learn is your own fortune; as long as she keeps up, Master Deng has no reason to slow down the teaching pace for you."
 

 
That made sense.
 

 
However, the other disciples were skeptical: had Tong Zhao really learned everything?
 

 
They all thought it was too fast; didn’t Tong Zhao feel the same way?
 

 
So someone went to ask her.
 

 
During a break, Director Deng was not far away and perked up his ears when he heard this question.
 

 
Duan Ge was leisurely drinking water, replying, "It’s not fast; I think it’s just right."
 

 
The disciples were not convinced and didn’t believe she had really learned everything and found it just right. "Senior Aunt, don’t force yourself. It’s better to master one set before moving on to the next; you can’t bite off more than you can chew."
 

 
"I’m not forcing myself,"
 

 
Duan Ge finished her bottled water with a few hearty gulps, her beautiful eyes casually scanning the speaker. "Don’t believe me? Want to go one-on-one? Only with the techniques I’ve learned."
 

 
If there weren’t any pre-set restrictions, her fighting style would feel more streetwise.
 

 
Since it was a rare opportunity for "reviewing the old and learning the new," of course, it was best to use the techniques she had just learned!
 

 
The disciple clearly hadn’t expected the celebrity to propose a one-on-one match, and a look of disbelief crossed his face, as if to say, "Are you kidding me?" However, Duan Ge’s challenge was laid out before him, and backing down would be even more embarrassing. The martial arts school allowed disciples to spar with each other, so he had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree.
 

 
He turned back to discuss with the other disciples how they could go easy on her.
 

 
In his thoughts, he quickly imagined the moment he would be pinned to the ground by Duan Ge during the sparring match.
 

 
The dilemma of how to go easy on her turned into thoughts of how to defeat her.
 

 
Duan Ge stood tall, her expression still calm and composed.
 

 
There was a hint of restraint within her solitude.
 

 
It was genuinely hard to suppress her laughter.
 

 
Throughout the sparring match, her mind was filled with thoughts like…
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fight well, and hit harder! Show him he shouldn’t underestimate you!"
 

 
Shuyi: "Make it hurt a bit; I don’t want anyone else coming to challenge me when I’m on duty."
 

 
Duan Ge had become the golden fighter of Tong Zhao's personality.
 

 
For her, the hardest part was actually holding back her laughter during the match.
 

 
Just a moment ago, she couldn’t help but smile.
 

 
The defeated disciple A took a long time to regain his senses.
 

 
At one point, when his attack was countered and he was taken down, he caught a close-up glimpse of the slight curve of Duan Ge’s lips, as if she was trying hard to suppress something… Was it? Yes, she had numerous opportunities to deliver a lethal blow, and that was clearly a smile indicating the restraint of lethal intent!
 

 
Realizing this, disciple A felt a chill run down his spine. Once he managed to scramble to his feet, he cupped his fists and said, "Senior Aunt, you’re amazing! I willingly concede!"
 

 
The other disciples were skeptical, thinking he had gone too easy and messed up.
 

 
Naturally, a second disciple came forward to seek guidance.
 

 
Duan Ge felt it was a bit unfair—after all, she had a body cultivated through the way of immortals, where martial arts and spiritual practice were inseparable. Besides, she had far more experience in one-on-one combat than these young men, who were used to sparring with strict rules of martial ethics at the school. To put it bluntly, she knew exactly where to hit to make her opponent momentarily powerless, and her mindset was calm, confident, and free of fear. She possessed all the ideal traits of a martial artist.
 

 
But so what if it felt unfair?
 

 
The satisfaction of winning one after another was simply too exhilarating!
 

 
It only took one sparring match for them to go from casually calling her "Senior Aunt" to genuinely respecting her as their mentor.
 

 
A month passed quickly.
 

 
During this not too long or too short period of time together, the photographer had completely turned into a fan of Tong Zhao. Anyone who lived with her and wanted to improve while often procrastinating would be infected by her unrelenting drive and action. When the photographer excitedly took the footage back to edit, Tong Zhao also woke up from her holiday and returned to her original city, diving into a series of promotional appearances.
 

 
She appeared on an interview program and a traditional variety show themed around ancient cuisine.
 

 
In this variety show, guests were required to wear ancient costumes.
 

 
This provided an opportunity for Consort Chen to perform—
 

 
In fact, Tong Zhao initially planned to do it herself, but when Consort Chen playfully said she wanted to join in, Tong Zhao agreed!
 

 
Whatever she wanted to do, pampering herself was the priority.
 

 
On the variety show, Consort Chen radiated an aura that outshone everyone else. The combined effect of the system's aura and her own enchanting presence created a multiplier effect that was far more than just 1 + 1.
 

 
As a result, the other female guests were completely overshadowed.
 

 
It wasn’t that the production team didn’t film them; they did, but their discussions were quickly overshadowed.
 

 
Some female guests were relieved that Tong Zhao was only appearing for one episode, thinking that they would be fine once that was over.
 

 
However, others couldn’t sit still.
# Chapter86
"Breaking News! Tong Zhao and Rumored Boyfriend Spotted in Qin City: Is It Fake Studying or Real Affair?"
 

 
"Mr. Wei's Green Hat: Is the Truth Really Like This?"
 

 
"Tong Zhao and Handsome Guy Caught in Flirty Interaction on the Streets: Fans Shocked and Disappointed"
 

 
The reporter who captured these photos made a tidy sum on the side.
 

 
Why was this only revealed now?
 

 
Because they were negotiating the price.
 

 
In this batch of photos, Tong Zhao, wearing a mask, was seen walking down the street with a tall man in black sportswear before they got into a car. There wasn't any ambiguous behavior; they didn't kiss or hold hands, so the photos weren't particularly valuable, and the entertainment media were reluctant to pay a high price for them. However, the reporter believed they should be worth more.
 

 
Since the price didn’t meet their expectations, the reporter preferred to keep them under wraps. After all, the reporter didn’t dislike Tong Zhao and even liked her movies.
 

 
It wasn't until Tong Zhao finished her closed-door training and appeared on "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat"...
 

 
Things unexpectedly got messy.
 

 
The timeline needs to be pushed back two days—
 

 
There was a co-star on the same show, actress Ning Siya, who had a tranquil demeanor and a deep understanding of ancient cuisine. She had recently gained some popularity with a light idol drama, "Palm-sized Preserved Fruits," which revolved around ancient food. Both her manager and she thought that "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" would be a great variety show choice for her.
 

 
Think about it: fans who loved her for the ancient culinary drama would see her in a similar-themed variety show and find her character very relatable, leading to increased affection for her. The interest generated by the variety show would also reflect positively on her drama, creating a virtuous cycle.
 

 
But the problem was that Tong Zhao was also on the same show.
 

 
During the costume change segment, Ning Siya chose a light yellow ancient dress. Another female guest asked her if she didn’t prefer wearing white. She replied, “In most dynasties, white is considered an unlucky mourning color. Although I really like the clean and unblemished look of white, I still have to remember the traditions of our ancestors.”
 

 
Because they were going to shoot in a resort themed like an ancient palace, this statement didn’t seem unreasonable. It painted the image of a cultured girl who valued traditions. However, another female guest, who wasn’t very educated, was nervously clutching a white outfit she apparently intended to wear. After hearing this, she awkwardly smiled and put the dress back.
 

 
Seeing this, Ning Siya also smiled and said, “If you have any questions about the rules, feel free to ask me. But I’m just an amateur; I’m only interested in this aspect.”
 

 
…At that moment, Consort Chen, dressed in a gown styled like a dragon robe, walked over and curiously asked, “According to the traditions, shouldn’t one kneel when seeing someone in a dragon robe?”
 

 
Ning Siya froze on the spot.
 

 
Seeing her not respond, Consort Chen finished her smile and went off to talk to someone else.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t entirely an “ancient person.” After all, from the beginning in the ancient world, Tong Zhao had known she was on a quick transmigration mission. It was her belief in “my fate is in my own hands, not dictated by heaven” and the spirit of “how can princes and nobles have more power than me?” that allowed her to break through many crises in unconventional ways. However, spending so long in that world—almost a lifetime—had formed her into a distinct personality.
 

 
So, when Consort Chen had the choice to wear what she liked, she unhesitatingly chose the audacious style of a dragon robe dress.
 

 
If the emperor could wear it, then so could she.
 

 
In fact, there was a time when she accidentally spilled tea, and the liquid soaked her foot; she even stepped on the emperor’s dragon robe to dry it off. What’s the big deal? She wore what she wanted and enjoyed herself. How could she uphold the title of Consort without being a little willful?
 

 
At that moment, Ning Siya was arranged to sit next to Tong Zhao, her beautiful face adorned with a gentle smile, presenting an ethereal, unworldly appearance.
 

 
Many people admired her style.
 

 
Elegant and serene, she resembled a fairy who had strayed into the mortal world.
 

 
But the problem was, sitting beside her was Consort Chen, radiating an overwhelming presence.
 

 
Bright yellow was already an eye-catching color, overshadowing Ning Siya, who wore a light yellow dress—did she prefer subtlety? Then she might as well embrace it.
 

 
There seemed to be no chance for her to shine brightly.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t targeting her specifically.
 

 
It was just that, as a favored Consort, she had developed the habit of wanting to stand out. Hiding her brilliance and playing second fiddle was impossible for her.
 

 
The theme of "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" was about modernized ancient cuisine, featuring segments where guests sampled food and also prepared simple dishes together. During the cooking segment, Consort Chen was clumsy and wanted to quit after a while. However, she forced herself to complete it, thinking of impressing Zhao Zhao on the show. It was quite humbling for her—this princess personally washing her hands to make soup; she definitely had to make Zhao Zhao happy afterward.
 

 
In this round, Ning Siya shone more brightly, but during the food tasting segment, all the attention was snatched by Consort Chen.
 

 
Even if one ingredient was of lesser quality, every dish prepared with care…
 

 
Consort Chen could discern every flavor; nothing escaped her taste buds.
 

 
The comments ranged from those criticizing her for being spoiled to others recognizing that she actually had a deep understanding and appreciation for ancient cuisine, just lacking in practical skills, which suited her role as a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao's portrayal of the concubine had resonated well with the audience.
 

 
After all, a concubine should be a bit pampered.
 

 
Moreover, her previous appearances on "72 Hours" and "One Life Survivor" proved she could endure hardship and withstand tough challenges, while being a little lazy and picky in peacetime was merely endearing.
 

 
Some viewers, holding onto the fantasy that "celebrities should be flawless," relentlessly criticized Tong Zhao in the comments.
 

 
[It’s puzzling—how can someone who can only eat but not cook be a cute point?]
 

 
[I think she just doesn’t want to work.]
 

 
This statement had some truth to it.
 

 
Consort Chen really didn’t want to work.
 

 
[Are we really saying Tong Zhao is lazy after just one episode????]
 

 
[Come on, this is just a light-hearted variety show; the guests are here to eat, drink, and have fun. Would you get scolded for not having the correct posture while farming at a homestay? Besides, Tong Zhao has always been quite capable in the kitchen. She just came out of closed-door training and only wants to eat, so what's wrong with that? Are you eating her rice?]
 

 
With this part of the criticism, the controversy surrounding Tong Zhao boosted the discussion of this episode of the variety show.
 

 
Of course, just eating and being picky can be off-putting, but Consort Chen also had her likable traits.
 

 
She sincerely praised the well-prepared dishes, noticing details that other guests missed:
 

 
“The broth is a bit bland. Adding vinegar would ruin the chef’s carefully crafted sweetness. If only we had Jinhua ham juice!”
 

 
When asked about a dish that had a texture similar to fish belly and fish maw, she was able to elaborate: “This is the tendon from the back of the sturgeon; it tastes like fish belly but has more bounce.”
 

 
However, she absolutely refused to eat fish with a muddy taste.
 

 
The comments playfully remarked that they had invited a serious emperor:
 

 
[Tong Zhao in a dragon robe is practically the emperor himself, aside from gender.]
 

 
[How about a gender-swapped version of "The Legend of Ming Emperor"? I’d definitely watch! I want to see Zhao Zhao as the female emperor!]
 

 
[No, no, no, she doesn’t have the taste of someone who commands the world. She’s better suited to play a foolish ruler who should be fed grapes by beautiful women, doing nothing but enjoying food and fun every day.]
 

 
Screenshots of Tong Zhao's beauty on the variety show were referred to as depictions of a pampered concubine donning a dragon robe.
 

 
#PamperedConcubineBigBoldTongZhao#
 

 
This trending topic was filled with Tong Zhao's expressive memes.
 

 
When she tasted a piece of fish with a slight fishy smell that the other guests didn’t notice, [Tong Zhao looked disdainful.jpg], her spoiled attitude was entirely justified. There was also the moment when someone asked Ning Siyu if she should kneel before the dragon robe, [Tong Zhao looked puzzled.jpg]... Whatever is fun, let’s go with it. Others might not know, but Song Wanzhuo had a whole collection of these memes in her WeChat and secretly gave a thumbs-up to the production team.
 

 
Half of the money behind this trending topic came from the "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" variety show team.
 

 
It wasn't because they were enchanted by Tong Zhao's charm.
 

 
It was simply because she was the most discussed point of this episode; the backend data clearly indicated it, and the show just went along to ride the wave of her popularity. While others joined the variety show to gain exposure, Tong Zhao’s presence ended up giving the show a boost in heat!
 

 
No one making a variety show would pass up the chance to invite Tong Zhao.
 

 
She always delivered unexpected results; for example, "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" had steady but mediocre ratings. As soon as she appeared, the ratings skyrocketed. It was completely worth the high price they paid to have her on.
 

 
The outcome was that no one was talking about Ning Siyu; her appearance was practically meaningless.
 

 
What angered Ning Siyu the most was seeing people who initially tuned in to watch "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" for her end up being captivated by Tong Zhao. Her manager comforted her, saying that because of Tong Zhao, this second-tier variety show had jumped to first-tier ratings, giving her higher exposure than before...
 

 
This consolation was worse than useless; Ning Siyu was furious!
 

 
Then there was that part where they asked her if she should kneel upon seeing the dragon robe, and the trolls were criticizing her for pretending and ruining her image. Of course, her elders, who had worked hard to liberate China with blood and tears, could wear whatever they wanted. How could she take other guests' advice on what to wear, using “the rules of our ancestors” to point fingers at them? Did she really think she was a cultured matriarch?
 

 
Ning Siyu felt that these people were just Tong Zhao's fans, coming to annoy her.
 

 
However, in reality, these trolls were simultaneously criticizing Consort Chen for being lazy, picky, and spoiled, merely behaving like typical trolls.
 

 
She really wanted to vent her frustration!
 

 
It was too easy for people in the industry to find dirt on others. Just a hint, and sellers would come looking for her.
 

 
Ning Siyu thought to herself that it was just the cost of three bags, and at worst, she could just act cute with her sugar daddy.
 

 
She bought bags for face value, and now Tong Zhao had made her lose face; venting her anger took priority over buying bags. She quickly arranged for the paparazzi to get a scoop... The reporter took the money and then sold it to the media for a cheaper price.
 

 
After all, Ning Siyu wanted him to expose Tong Zhao, and she never said he couldn’t make a second profit.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was more popular than her, she was confident this would hurt her!
 

 
...
 

 
Her manager asked Tong Zhao if she had any idea who she had offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao was just about to say no.
 

 
Consort Chen: [It must be that person sitting next to me with that gloomy face the whole time.]
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment and asked, “How did you know about this?”
 

 
Consort Chen replied, “I’m very sensitive to malice coming from the same gender.”
 

 
Truly a master of palace intrigue.
 

 
Since she didn’t respond, Sister Chu continued, “But it doesn’t matter. Who did it isn’t important; everyone wants to bring you down or ride your coattails. There’s really nothing to gain from this; it’s mostly just paparazzi snapping random shots.”
 

 
That reasoning was quite reasonable.
 

 
It was enough to consider all competitors as potential enemies; Tong Zhao never thought about making friends in the industry... The entertainment world was essentially a super-large corporation. For adults to genuinely want to befriend colleagues was naive and unnecessary. Of course, there are examples of true friendships, but more often than not, there are incompatible plastic friends, backstabbers competing for promotions, and those you think are friends but turn out to treat you as merely a colleague before quietly leaving, disappearing into the crowd.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao didn’t take the Ning family’s actions to heart, nor would she blame Consort Chen for drawing attention and attracting enemies.
 

 
Tong Zhao praised her, “If you can make people hate you, it seems our princess is doing quite well.”
 

 
Consort Chen responded, “It’s manageable.”
 

 
Sister Chu added, “Now Tong Zhao has the persona tag of being lazy and picky; how do you explain that?”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied, “That just means our Zhao Zhao is living well enough to be picky while being lazy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh.
 

 
Her manager was baffled by her laughter and asked if she had lost her mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “Of course not! It was my Fourth Senior Brother’s disciple who got photographed. That day, my master suddenly wanted to eat stinky tofu and oil lamp drum from the market, and I had already drunk two cups of my master’s homemade wine in the morning, so I couldn’t drive. I asked my nephew to take me to buy it; it was all out of kindness.”
 

 
If some baseless gossip and unfounded malice could affect Tong Zhao's mindset...
 

 
Then she shouldn’t be in the entertainment industry and should just pack up and return to business.
 

 
Sister Chu understood and decided to come up with a public relations strategy to let Tong Zhao relax for a couple of days.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt completely at ease, but someone else couldn’t sit still.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked when he saw these reports and photos while surfing the internet. No matter who asked him, he claimed he didn’t know anything about it. How could he be greened if they weren’t even together? It must be that damn paparazzi fabricating stories about his good buddy again! Wei Zekai noticed that Tong Zhao hadn’t mentioned the matter at all, and he felt too shy to ask.
 

 
If he were to ask, wouldn’t it make him seem no different from any other netizen?
 

 
To bring up some baseless rumors and gossip with her?
 

 
This is really outrageous.
 

 
But that night, as he tossed and turned, unable to sleep, Wei Zekai finally couldn’t hold back anymore and secretly sent her a message on WeChat: “Have you started dating?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[So love will disappear, right.jpg]”
 

 
After sending it, he thought it sounded too feminine and quickly added a masculine crying cat emoji.
 

 
Good, that’s the kind of emoji a tough guy should use!
 

 
At that time, Tong Zhao was fast asleep, with her body being played with by Consort Chen.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “Don’t browse through her phone.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “But this is my phone too! Ah, it’s just so bitter to think about it. Back then, when I time-traveled to this backward ancient era, I couldn’t even play with my phone. The biggest entertainment was listening to music. It was even more amusing to watch other concubines perform monkey tricks after entering the palace.”
 

 
That makes sense.
 

 
Even if they have different names, they are essentially the same individual.
 

 
Consort Chen wanted to tease Wei Zekai; she had a good impression of him.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were left to her own devices, it would probably be forty years before anything happened.
 

 
Now, let’s shift the camera to the WeChat page on the phone—
 

 
Tong Zhao: “What, are you very interested in my love life?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I’m not here to gossip.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Then tell me, what did you think when you saw those reports?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I was really angry that they made up stories, but I’m also a bit afraid they might be true.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If it’s true, and you didn’t tell me about such a big thing as starting a relationship, I’d wonder if you don’t see me as a brother anymore, or if I’m the only one who thinks of you as a really important friend.”
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen: “Damn it, what an idiot.”
 

 
Consort Chen threw the phone onto the bed and directly slipped back into her consciousness palace to sleep.
 

 
As for the boy who was eagerly waiting for a response…
 

 
Why should she care about a man’s thoughts? The beautiful woman was puzzled.
 

 
So, when Tong Zhao woke up and checked her phone, she realized she had left Wei Zekai hanging for an entire night.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought he had said something wrong and, feeling aggrieved, apologized to her. Unable to think of a way to cheer her up, he secretly logged into her game account and sent her a screenshot of his eight consecutive victories.
 

 
How should I put it? The thought process of a gamer is quite peculiar.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Fake.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If I were dating someone, I would tell you right away.”
 

 
When Wei Zekai woke up and saw her reply, he felt relieved but also strangely dissatisfied.
 

 
Just as the reporter had thought, those photos didn’t elicit much of a reaction from the fans.
 

 
So what if she was dating?
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t peddling the illusion of romance. Some fans even hoped for fewer boyfriend fans, and some comments seemed rather creepy.
 

 
And then there were those old-fashioned 2G internet users who were completely caught off guard: “What? Isn’t Tong Zhao’s boyfriend Wei Zekai?”
 

 
And even more absurdly: “Doesn’t Tong Zhao have a boyfriend named Han Zhi?”
 

 
Fans couldn’t take it anymore: “That’s still her!”
 

 
Ning Siya couldn’t figure out why the gossip attacks didn’t seem to affect Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s other competitors saw that this “bird standing out” was rather useless—what was the point of attacking her love life? Without understanding where the pain points were, they jumped on the bandwagon, leading public opinion to ferment for an entire afternoon, shifting focus to another point:
 

 
“Rational Discussion: Is Tong Zhao’s effort to create a hard-working persona getting a bit excessive? Has she fallen off in the food variety show?”
 

 
The post scrutinized Tong Zhao’s performance in “Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat” and combined it with the “shopping photos” that had been taken, questioning whether her month of training in seclusion was real or just for show. Similar content appeared on Weibo marketing accounts and various public accounts. It was impossible to trace who initiated the attacks, but it could only be said that Tong Zhao had recently attracted too much attention from the opposing side.
 

 
Even if they could take down her current endorsement, that would be something.
 

 
Seeing these posts didn’t upset Tong Zhao.
 

 
But Consort Chen was quite upset.
 

 
Consort Chen felt wronged: “Isn’t it in line with my persona to be a beautiful, lazy eater? How can that be called ‘falling off’?”
 

 
She didn’t care when people talked about her, but it upset her to see Tong Zhao being poked in the back.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and said, “It’s not your fault; it’s just that there are too many people who hate me.”
 

 
The only way to avoid disputes was to quit the spotlight and stop competing with others.
 

 
By evening, the official Weibo account of the martial arts academy suddenly posted a new update, seriously clarifying recent gossip. However, the focus wasn’t on protecting Tong Zhao; instead, it highlighted the identity of the “mysterious man,” stating that he was Tong Zhao’s apprentice. The accompanying photo showed a spirited young man with a crew cut holding a certain award, smiling brightly and innocently.
 

 
This Weibo post, unlike the usual light-hearted style of Director Deng, used very formal language, and the tone was noticeably angry.
 

 
After posting the formal statement, Director Deng made a private comment that quickly became a hot comment: “That day, I suddenly had a craving for stinky tofu and oil lamp drum, so I ordered them to go to the market to buy it for me. I didn’t expect it to cause such a big fuss [Panda looking aggrieved.JPG].”
 

 
If the focus had been on protecting Tong Zhao, people might have read into it more.
 

 
Fans suddenly understood, and the attention of bystanders shifted to how Director Deng was keeping up with trends and even using memes.
 

 
This was where the matter could have ended.
 

 
Who would take something from a food and entertainment variety show seriously?
 

 
Was it really a black mark for artists to enjoy themselves? That shouldn’t be the case. However, the opposing side didn’t want to miss this opportunity… Sister Chu suspected it was because she was trying to tear up a jewelry endorsement for Tong Zhao, and the chances were quite high.
 

 
The press releases and trending topics were still being arranged; the only way to suppress them was to spend money.
 

 
Those who had been trying to undermine Tong Zhao realized there wouldn’t be any more waves, so they were preparing to give their side some positive publicity when a new development arose.
 

 
It was a promotional video edited by Huashi Sports, featuring Shi Dingjun, Tong Zhao, and the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.
 

 
Huashi Sports V:
 
“The Collision of Entertainment and Traditional Martial Arts: Tong Zhao’s 30 Days at Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.”
# Chapter87
“In the modern city, amidst the hustle and bustle, there lies a classical building hidden in the depths of prosperity. Passersby, upon seeing the century-old plaque, might wonder if it belongs to an expensive private restaurant or a wealthy mansion. However, the residents nearby know that this is the residence of one of the most influential traditional martial arts masters in China and abroad…”
 

 
The opening scene features aerial shots of Qin City, suddenly zooming in on the area around the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
The hurried crowds, fast-forwarded in the footage, slow down in front of the center's outer wall, revealing the cold plum blossoms blooming outside.
 

 
Next is an interview with Elder Deng.
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “This plaque was left to me by my master. It has a history of over a hundred years and was renovated just the year before last. It looks much newer now. Some people advised me to leave it as it was, saying that would make it look like a century-old plaque. I don’t like that; there’s no need. Even if it’s repaired to look brand new, its essence will remain unchanged.”
 

 
Narration: “Elder Deng does not reject new things; however, he hasn’t taken on disciples for a long time.”
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “I’ve had enough disciples. I stopped accepting new ones long ago; it’s all my students who are teaching now.”
 

 
Cameraman: “What about Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Elder Deng squints, looking at Tong Zhao talking with other disciples nearby, his tone becoming light and proud: “She’s particularly talented. I don’t feel at ease letting others teach her.”
 

 
After piquing the audience’s curiosity, the scene shifts to a close-up of Tong Zhao speaking with her disciples.
 

 
Boys, each a head taller than her, listen attentively to her insights on the course content, earnestly calling her “Auntie Master,” creating a somewhat humorous scene. With only her slender brows drawn and a natural light makeup of pink lipstick, she appears to the straight male audience as though she’s naturally beautiful without any embellishment. Even if they can’t understand what she’s saying, they can’t help but be drawn to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Do you understand now?”
 

 
Disciple One hesitantly replies: “I understand…”
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “I think you don’t understand; just jump right in and practice.”
 

 
[There’s a kind of misunderstanding where the master’s niece thinks you don’t understand.]
 

 
[Jumping right in seems fine, though! Hahaha.]
 

 
[So fierce; Tong Zhao must be the only female star who can fall into a den of men without any romantic vibes.]
 

 
[No romantic vibe, but there’s definitely a sense of intimidation…]
 

 
Saying this, the two of them went into the inner area, where the other disciples instinctively surrounded them, creating a large open space.
 

 
Narration: “The martial arts school preserves the tradition of sparring, emphasizing control and restraint. Elder Deng mentioned that there used to be people who would challenge the school, but that hasn’t happened in a long time.”
 

 
A clip followed showing Tong Zhao first using her elbow, then delivering a powerful kick with her left leg, taking down her opponent in quick succession. It is often said that traditional Chinese martial arts use softness to overcome hardness, but all sports emphasize fundamental techniques. This concept is similar to weight classes in sports—different weight categories are used to separate competitors. For example, professional boxing has seventeen distinct weight classes, ranging from heavyweight to mini-flyweight.
 

 
Even Elder Deng couldn’t understand why Tong Zhao had such strength.
 

 
Not only was her power explosive in an instant, but she also had endurance. She could easily handle the wheel battles with her disciples. That’s why, in a short time, she managed to subdue this group of spirited young men, causing them to stop viewing her as a beautiful older sister and instead recognize her as a formidable master who was beyond their capabilities.
 

 
Viewers who saw this couldn’t believe their eyes and rewound the footage several times.
 

 
This was not a sequence designed by a choreographer in advance!
 

 
This was a real fight performed by real people!
 

 
The unwillingness and admiration on the young men’s faces didn’t look like acting.
 

 
The complete episode was uploaded on Huashi TV, primarily to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
Director Deng had many older Chinese fans who all had martial arts dreams but never pursued them due to various real-life reasons, or who had learned when they were younger but later abandoned it. When they saw this girl performing beautiful and smooth martial arts moves on TV and learned she was a star…
 

 
—“In the past, when I suggested you learn martial arts, you thought it was too tough and didn’t go. Look, mastering martial arts can lead to becoming a big star!”
 

 
—“Dad, martial arts has nothing to do with being a star…”
 

 
—“Are our Chinese female stars really this strong now?”
 

 
—“Luzi, come here and tell Dad, has this girl acted in any movies?”
 

 
As the full episode aired simultaneously, similar conversations arose in different households.
 

 
The later content focused on Tong Zhao’s life over the month she spent learning martial arts at the dojo, presenting the seemingly surreal life of martial arts from her perspective. They had a very down-to-earth side: many long-time disciples had become action designers, while those who hadn’t yet graduated were often working part-time jobs that required physical labor, alongside attending night school.
 

 
Tong Zhao would wake up before dawn to make breakfast for Master Deng, persisting day after day for a month, honoring the way of respecting her teacher.
 

 
The day she went to the market to buy snacks for Elder Deng was also documented by the cameraman.
 

 
However, not wanting to attract attention from passersby with a cameraman carrying a long lens, the camera only captured her getting into the car driven by her disciple.
 

 
The rumors and gossip naturally fell apart here—
 

 
That “mysterious man” was someone Tong Zhao had previously mercilessly pinned to the ground!
 

 
Can this be called love?
 

 
She would be better off if her older sister could date, right?
 

 
The complete version aired on television and various video platforms mainly discussed traditional martial arts culture and introduced the dojo. However, the edited version on Weibo understood what online viewers loved to see, highlighting all the exciting moments. Naturally, it included the impressive segments of Tong Zhao taking on her disciples in wheel battles, as well as her quick cuts of waking up early for thirty days, with shots of the breakfast she prepared.
 

 
You could see that although the dishes were simple, they were made with skill.
 

 
This also helped dispel the previous accusations of her being lazy and indulging in pleasures.
 

 
[So what if she relaxed a bit while participating in a variety show themed around food and fun? When she was genuinely learning, she was very willing to wake up early to make breakfast for her master.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao looks like the type who is very filial. I wonder if her deadbeat dad will regret seeing this program. Will his mistress's daughter cook for him every day when he gets old?]
 

 
[I really want to eat the breakfast made by Zhao Zhao!!!]
 

 
...
 

 
However, the hottest topic of discussion was still Tong Zhao defeating her disciples using the martial arts taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Not only were the disciples surprised, but the audience was too.
 

 
It turns out that Tong Zhao could not only fight in instinctive variety shows but was also highly skilled in real life?
 

 
This completely shattered public perception.
 

 
Last time, Tong Zhao showcased her athletic abilities that rivaled muscular men at the promotional event for "One Life Survivor," but actually fighting was a different matter. After all, everyone was used to the subconscious belief that people could achieve things in instinctive movies that they couldn't in reality...
 

 
In real life, an 180 cm tall guy was easily taken down by Tong Zhao?
 

 
[Old man on the subway looking at his phone.jpg]
 

 
Not only could she fight, but she also used the techniques taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Her performance was practically textbook-level in terms of promotional impact—smooth, elegant, and powerful.
 

 
Netizens collectively raised a soul-searching question—
 

 
How many more surprises does this woman have that they don’t know about?
 

 
In the secluded world of Tong Zhao’s home, Xu Zhu felt for the 108th time that Tong Zhao must have been possessed or time-traveled, because she had grown up with Tong Zhao and had no idea she had a martial arts background... or perhaps it was because she had never truly acknowledged her "best friend" or genuinely understood her.
 

 
However, Xu Zhu’s thoughts had become irrelevant to Tong Zhao and the netizens.
 

 
...
 

 
The large-scale, deliberately created doubts had attracted significant attention from netizens.
 

 
Then, just like that, the promotional video released by the official Huashi turned the situation around.
 

 
Wow.
 

 
This wave was free publicity!
 

 
If it hadn’t been for the intense backlash earlier, the effect wouldn’t be so good now. Of course, the credit also went to Tong Zhao's manager, who monitored public sentiment, contacted Elder Deng, and coordinated with Huashi to establish a promotional plan. This not only promoted traditional martial arts but also cleverly clarified the negative rumors while boosting Tong Zhao’s reputation and popularity with the public.
 

 
This was a classic example of public relations that achieved three goals with one shot, elevating Sister Chu’s reputation in the industry. Many artists with contracts ending soon wanted to switch to her management, but she turned down quite a few, saying she couldn’t take them all on.
 

 
In the domestic entertainment industry, while it can feel vast, it can also feel quite small.
 

 
Sister Chu proudly shared her triumph in her social circle:
 

 
[When the retrograde hits, small-minded people swarm around; when it's over, we rise with the momentum! When others ask me if working with artists is hard, I say it is. There's no possibility of a stable routine; fabricated scandals don't adhere to a 9-to-5 schedule, and I often get phone calls at midnight. Plus, there’s one exceptionally talented artist whose invites for variety shows, movies, and TV dramas are so numerous that I couldn’t sort through them even after three sleepless nights. Sigh. Hang in there, hardworking people!】
 

 
The attached photo shows a large stack of documents, with a corner revealing the name "Tong Zhao."
 

 
Everyone knows that Tong Zhao is the most formidable artist under Sister Chu's management.
 

 
This social media post could be considered a modern classic of “humblebragging.”
 

 
This post, pretending to complain but actually showing off, poked at many people's sore spots—
 

 
There are so many who envy Tong Zhao that a few more won’t make a difference. The ones secretly undermining her, especially Ning Siya, were furious after realizing they inadvertently wove her a wedding dress and couldn’t eat all day. Of course, that competitive jewelry endorsement also benefited from this publicity on Huashi, greatly enhancing Tong Zhao's image, allowing her to secure the deal.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s team popped champagne to celebrate, while she just handled the mundane task of taking photos and collecting payment, even giving her manager's post a like.
 

 
Does it do any good to be jealous of her?
 

 
Not at all. When Shi Dingjun started filming "The Knives of the Maiden," Tong Zhao returned to Qin City, where her jewelry advertisement was already prominently displayed at the city’s most prestigious shopping center, with the highest rent and foot traffic.
 

 
With her black hair and snow-white skin, Tong Zhao smiled faintly, her red lips curving slightly.
 

 
Her chin slightly raised, accentuating her beautifully defined jawline, she wore a diamond necklace adorned with large sapphires. Her thick, soft black hair was pulled back, exuding a cold yet beautiful aura. The diamond earrings shaped like snakes hugged her shell-like ears, giving her a unique villainous charm.
 

 
This poster was a performance passionately delivered by Consort Chen.
 

 
She had previously thought about having her portrait hung on the palace walls so that people could see what the most beautiful favored concubine looked like. However, the painter's skills were limited, and she wasn't used to ink portraits. Moreover, the emperor was incredibly jealous, so she gave up.
 

 
Therefore, this endorsement satisfied her vanity.
 

 
No matter how luxurious the cars passing by are or how affluent the pedestrians appear, they must lift their heads to look up at her in the advertisement.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao's entertainment company is directly across from this shopping plaza.
 

 
The people who plotted against her during this incident would have to constantly look up at this strikingly beautiful advertisement…
 

 
As Ning Siya stepped out of the chauffeur-driven car on her way to the company, her eyes immediately caught sight of the advertisement across the street. She squeezed the Starbucks cup in her hand, causing it to crumple slightly. In the lower left corner of the poster was Tong Zhao's signature and her introduction: [Popular Female Star of 20xx].
 

 
Popular female star?
 

 
Ning Siya saw her as an infuriating star!
 

 
...
 

 
Qin City, high-end VIP shooting studio.
 

 
Tong Zhao's holographic shooting pod was separate from the others.
 

 
The other characters were in a large filming studio, which was one of the privileges of being a lead actor.
 

 
"Can we start?"
 

 
After checking the equipment, all the crew members took their places.
 

 
With a command from the director, countless consciousness streams flowed into the device, and the monitoring screens suddenly lit up.
 

 
It was as if they were in another world.
 

 
"The Knives of the Maiden" had a lighthearted tone, beginning with a theft of cultural relics. Dressed in black, with long hair tied in a ponytail, Fu Xuancheng stealthily took an ancient sword and left a new replica next to the safe before elegantly departing. This action choreography was created by Director Deng's sixth disciple, who, despite his honest and sturdy appearance, excelled at fluid martial arts movements. He was humorously nicknamed the "most agile fat guy" by his brothers in the school.
 

 
The same martial arts moves performed by the exceptionally fit rising star Zeng Mingjun appeared suave and charming.
 

 
The supervisor nodded repeatedly, saying, "Your brother's choreography is impeccable; the details are spot on."
 

 
Director Shi lamented, "He couldn’t squeeze in the time to attend classes; the start and end of his movements always feel a bit stiff."
 

 
"There’s no helping it; after all, it's a predetermined program without his personal input."
 

 
The backstage was orderly, monitoring every detail of the film like gods fulfilling their roles, ensuring the world continued to operate smoothly.
 

 
The original footage hadn’t been edited yet.
 

 
However, the director already had an idea in mind: the scene should freeze on the villain Fu Xuancheng leaping on the rooftop, the corners of his trench coat billowing, creating a light-and-shadow silhouette under the moonlight. This shot would be captured by passersby and appear on the front page the next day. Meanwhile, the protagonist Xie Guiya's boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, would excitedly bring this clipping to show off to his girlfriend.
 

 
Tong Zhao entered Cheng Siwen's line of sight, and he saw her walking toward him and sitting down at a milk tea shop.
 

 
Up until this point, everything was fine.
 

 
After Tong Zhao appeared, the supervisor remarked, "I've heard that many TV dramas have sent her scripts, but I think she’s more suited for the big screen. Her figure is truly exceptional; even in this ordinary college casual wear, she still stands out. From the side, her physique is simply different—like a swan among a flock of ducks."
 

 
The assistant director added, "She’s the kind of person who makes you understand why others are background actors while she is the star."
 

 
"Alright, let’s stop before we sound like fans ourselves."
 

 
A few Tong Zhao fans, "lurking" among the crew, were internally cheering.
 

 
In the scene, Cheng Siwen excitedly recounted the modern martial arts-style theft case from the previous night to his girlfriend, along with the silhouette: "It couldn't be wrong; what ordinary thief would dress like that while standing on a rooftop? Look at the agility described; it must be lightness skills!”
 

 
The photo of the master thief standing atop a tall pillar dominated more than half the page.
 

 
In the corner of the society section was a small news piece about seven punks who had suffered varying degrees of minor injuries and were fainting on the side of the street.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was supposed to have a strong aversion to martial arts and heroes, frowned upon hearing her boyfriend's sermon.
 

 
She clearly disagreed with what he was saying.
 

 
In the script, she was supposed to react strongly and refute Cheng Siwen, making him feel deflated.
 

 
However, on screen, Tong Zhao's brows relaxed, and her expression instantly softened: "I think your reasoning, Siwen, makes a lot of sense, and it’s quite interesting."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn't she supposed to start scolding him right away?
 

 
The screenwriter was puzzled.
 

 
Cheng Siwen's eyes lit up at his girlfriend's approval: "Really?"
 

 
"Yes, of course."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded. Her slightly lowered gaze revealed her inner skepticism, but her attitude remained very accommodating as she engaged in a discussion about martial arts with him.
 

 
It's quite common for actors to subconsciously deviate from the script.
 

 
However, no one expected it to happen so quickly. The screenwriter and director discussed it and speculated that Tong Zhao's month-long stay at the martial arts school had significantly increased her acceptance of traditional martial arts, making her subconscious rejection of martial arts something she couldn’t quite reconcile!
 

 
So what should they do now?
 

 
The character designer shook his head: "This is a core setting; it shouldn't be so easily shaken."
 

 
In the next moment, as they left the milk tea shop after paying, Tong Zhao took Cheng Siwen's hand and gently told him that she actually didn't like martial arts and really hated things like heroes. Her tone was warm yet firm, and both Cheng Siwen and the viewers in front of the monitor could clearly feel her resistance and aversion.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was stunned.
 

 
"Then why didn’t you tell me that just now? Why did you let me keep talking?"
 

 
"Because you’re my boyfriend, and you were speaking to me. I wanted to hear you finish and understand your perspective," Tong Zhao's voice was already charming, and in this film, it sounded even more melodious. However, it was not the sultry tone from the time of "The Legend of Ming," but instead carried a neutral, calming, and mysterious power: "Let’s keep things separate; I also want to be honest with you about my views."
 

 
Tong Zhao said, "I really hate martial arts, and heroes shouldn’t exist. I don't accept that."
 

 
She held his hand tightly, her expression focused as she looked at him.
 

 
In her slightly pale eyes lay a world he didn’t know about.
 

 
Director Shi was captivated by her eyes, and a light bulb went off in his head: "I just got inspired! We should give Tong Zhao a close-up here, then transition directly from her eyes to her returning home, facing the man known as the last hero of China, Father Xie!"
 

 
The screenwriter, who wanted to say something but held back: "..."
 

 
Fine.
 

 
As long as the actors want to change things, they can, as long as he doesn’t have to rewrite the script!
 

 
Like traditional films, the status of the screenwriter varies; in "The Knives of the Maiden this particular one was on the lower end, essentially serving as a tool.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Here, Tong Zhao's performance has come full circle. Compared to what she unconsciously improvised, the original plot felt a bit overdone."
 

 
Supervisor: "But the original version would be funnier, right?"
 

 
Assistant Director: "That’s true…"
 

 
The group held differing opinions, but ultimately, there was no disagreement that this way of handling the character would likely create a better first impression for the audience and make her more likable. After all, the protagonist’s strong aversion to martial arts in the early stages might make some Chinese viewers uncomfortable, thinking she was too rebellious. Tong Zhao's way of addressing her rebellious feelings showed her subconscious capacity for tolerance and deep-rooted gentleness.
 

 
Reporters need to think critically, digging deep to uncover the truth hidden beneath a facade of peace.
 

 
However, interrupting the interviewee too often is generally considered taboo.
 

 
Thus, the reporter’s subconscious, despite harboring resentment toward traditional martial arts, would still endure and attentively listen to her boyfriend until he finished speaking.
 

 
There were no problems up to this point.
 

 
After returning home, Tong Zhao happened to see her father, who had been injured while fighting multiple opponents late at night, alone and applying medicinal alcohol. When he saw his daughter return, he let out a loud groan and pretended he couldn’t reach the injury, performing for a while. Noticing that his daughter did not react, he sadly asked, “My daughter, aren’t you going to ask why I’m hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "People who take risks often end up hurt."
 

 
Father Xie: "That wasn’t reckless; I was being a hero."
 

 
Hearing those four words made Tong Zhao’s head throb.
 

 
When she was young, her father was so obsessed with being a vigilante that he neglected her education. Every time Father Xie managed to carve out some time to come home, he never asked about her homework, didn’t accompany her to movies, or care about school matters; he only taught her martial arts. Ironically, she learned quickly and became skilled, which motivated him further, making him feel like he was nurturing the second-best fighter in the martial arts world!
 

 
After their parents divorced, her mother took her brother away, and the father-daughter relationship plunged to an all-time low.
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “Even the leader of the martial arts world can get beaten?”
 

 
“Pfft, a few little brats didn’t even touch my clothes.”
 

 
Father Xie stepped lightly, gracefully landing on the sofa next to Tong Zhao, wearing an expression that said [I’m injured, but I’m just acting]. He looked at his daughter: “Did you see the news? Those seven little brats were harassing a girl in public, and I had to teach them a little lesson. I believe if you had been there, you would have made the same choice as I did.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and chuckled: “I would create a distraction while calling the police; using violence to counter violence is the last resort.”
 

 
…
 

 
Screenwriter: “Originally, I wrote that they would get into an argument here.”
 

 
After discovering that her boyfriend particularly admired vigilantes at the milk tea shop, the protagonist returned home filled with frustration, only to find the source of her real anger was her father’s incessant chatter about being a hero. Her anger instantly doubled, pouring cold water on her father, who had been excitedly trying to improve their relationship.
 

 
The protagonist and her father share similar stubbornness, but their thought processes differ due to their contrasting upbringings.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen did not argue. After returning home, although she sparred verbally with her father, her thoughts were clear, and her speech was coherent.
 

 
Instinctual movies and quick-transitions through books are both susceptible to the butterfly effect.
 

 
Supervisor's Comment: "I think this version of the protagonist is more reasonable; after all, she’s a gifted student from a prestigious university."
 

 
Screenwriter: ‘Covering their face:’ "To be honest, I also think she’s performing very adorably."
 

 
Especially when she gives her dad a little smile; it really hits his soft spot!
 

 
However, just because Tong Zhao offered him a hint of a smile, Father Xie’s lips moved, and he blurted out, “Did you see today’s headline in the social news?”
 

 
The backstage crew, who had been joking around, immediately froze.
 

 
This dialogue should have occurred in at least two scenes later. How could Zhang Jianyi (the actor playing Father Xie) have such a lack of discretion? Just because his daughter smiled at him, he said that? Didn’t he fear that she would get upset and refuse to continue acting? What happened to the buildup?
 

 
Upon hearing this, Tong Zhao indeed stopped smiling.
 

 
Her lightly colored eyes swept over her father, and her brows furrowed, clearly displaying her displeasure and unwillingness to continue this topic.
 

 
But…
 

 
"You go ahead," she said.
# Chapter88
"The mysterious thief must have some remarkable skills in light-footwork," remarked Father Xie.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, "Mm-hmm, and then?"
 

 
Father Xie continued, "Mid-next month is the once-a-decade martial arts conference, and I suspect this is a provocation aimed at that gathering. Last time, there were three attendees—all of whom used the weapons that were just stolen. Especially that sword—only the Plum Blossom Swordsman would use such a noisy weapon like the Yan Wing Saber."
 

 
The Yan Wing Saber has five or more holes on its spine with bronze rings hanging from them. When swung, the rings clatter against the blade, creating a sound much like a wild goose's call. Tong Zhao nodded again, asking, "And what kind of person is the Plum Blossom Swordsman?"
 

 
The crew watched as the protagonist’s father proceeded to spill all the information about this future character, without restraint. He even shared the unknown secret that, ten years ago, the Plum Blossom Swordsman took out a high-interest loan just to replace all the bronze rings on his Yan Wing Saber with gold ones, missing the prime time to buy property. Now, this once-famous swordsman was still renting an apartment. Even the director didn’t know this detail. Director Shi glanced at the screenwriter and said, "You’ve created quite a rich backstory."
 

 
The screenwriter chuckled awkwardly, "I just enjoy adding hidden quirks to characters that might never get discovered."
 

 
The assistant director suggested, "This is a good place to insert a segment showcasing the Plum Blossom Swordsman, with Father Xie’s narration as the voiceover."
 

 
Director Shi agreed, and an assistant immediately added a note to the timeline. Since they weren’t editing as they shot, these notes would make post-production smoother, preventing any fleeting inspirations from slipping away.
 

 
…
 

 
Father Xie, oblivious to how much he'd been prodded into revealing, was delighted, thinking his daughter was finally interested in the martial world.
 

 
Encouraged, he boldly suggested sparring with her.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and refused, heading straight to her room. "I’m not doing something so pointless anymore."
 

 
"How can you call it pointless?" Father Xie looked visibly disappointed.
 

 
"It has meaning for you, so use ‘your’ time on it. But don’t force it onto my life," Tong Zhao said, pausing as she closed the door. With a trace of self-mockery, she added, "That said, I guess I’m stating the obvious, considering all your time has always been spent on this."
 

 
With that, she closed the door, sealing it as firmly as she had her heart.
 

 
In the original script, this scene had the protagonist slamming the door to show her dissatisfaction. However, Tong Zhao’s movements were understated—the door closed gently, blending smoothly into the frame without disturbing even the air. Yet this subtlety conveyed a sense of suffocating restraint, even more intense than if she had slammed the door. The camera followed Tong Zhao as she entered her room and picked up a small wooden dagger on her desk—a “toy” her father had given her as a child. Her childhood had no pretty dolls, no make-believe games; only martial arts and various martial arts-related "toys."
 

 
As a child, in pursuit of her father’s praise, she had trained diligently, displaying an exceptional talent for martial arts.
 

 
Father Xie's enthusiasm was partly fueled by the possibility that his daughter might carry on his legacy.
 

 
On the surveillance screen, Tong Zhao remained silent, her elegant face frozen without expression, as if time had stopped along with the air around her. Even through the screen, the crew could feel the suffocating tension. In the original script, the protagonist had several confrontational scenes early on to establish her character, but Tong Zhao’s subconscious had erased all of them, creating a more layered, subdued, and heartbreaking portrayal of a young woman.
 

 
She didn’t stay silent for long—perhaps only half a minute.
 

 
Yet why was the pressure so intense?
 

 
One perceptive crew member noticed, "She’s gripping the wooden dagger tightly; it’s pressing into her palm."
 

 
"Yes," Director Shi murmured thoughtfully. "Her body language is incredibly expressive."
 

 
As an older director, Shi had trained during the era when traditional films were dominant, studying both representational and method acting. Representational actors use specific expressions, gestures, or props as cues, allowing the audience to understand a character through these signals.
 

 
To use an example from anime, seeing a character with black hair and glasses might immediately bring to mind traits like intelligence or a sly nature. Creators often lean into such stereotypes when building characters.
 

 
But instinctive cinema doesn’t normally use representational methods.
 

 
Tong Zhao, however, was the closest thing to it he had ever seen. She would often employ small, signature gestures to reinforce a character's image. For example, in ‘Emperor Ming’, her consort character habitually took the emperor’s hand and nestled her face into it. Dedicated fans even made a compilation of these moments, noticing that she repeated this gesture almost every time she interacted with him, creating a lasting impression through repetition.
 

 
It was almost like intentional performance.
 

 
Suddenly, Tong Zhao moved.
 

 
Her face remained cold and expressionless, stripped of the gentle facade she showed to others. With surprising speed, she began twirling the wooden dagger in her hand. But the dagger wasn’t enough to release her frustration; with a flick of her wrist, she expertly threw it, landing it perfectly in its stand on her desk. Then, she picked up the sword lying beside her bed…
 

 
A protagonist who despised martial arts, now channeling her anger, executed three full sets of martial arts routines—combining forms from different schools—to vent her frustration.
 

 
This wasn’t in the script, either.
 

 
As she was about to sheath her sword, her father burst into the room, oblivious as always. "Guiya, I made your favorite char siu rice. Don’t be mad—"
 

 
His words trailed off as he froze, staring at his daughter wielding the sword.
 

 
That expression could only be described as, "I walked in and caught Chang Wei attacking Lai Fu."
 

 
‘Chang Wei, you said you didn’t know martial arts?’
 

 
Tong Zhao, you said you didn’t like martial arts?
 

 
Tong Zhao turned back coldly, pursed her lips, and calmly sheathed her sword. “I’ll come out to eat later. Dad, please leave for now; I’m changing.”
 

 
Father Xie was puzzled. “But…”
 

 
His daughter was clearly fully dressed!
 

 
Tong Zhao repeated, using her mesmerizing voice, “I’m changing.”
 

 
“Alright, alright, I’ll leave right now.”
 

 
Indulgent as ever, her father quickly closed the door and left.
 

 
The bedroom returned to silence.
 

 
On screen, a soft pink blush crept onto Tong Zhao’s elegant face, her ears turning red.
 

 
---
 

 
The director and assistant director were deep in discussion about the storyline. Meanwhile, the screenwriter had rolled off to a corner, munching on snacks and complaining to the character designer, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious is incredible at rewriting the story. I’d heard Old Bei mention that she had erased an intricately designed power struggle scene he’d crafted, but I thought that was just a one-time thing. Turns out, this is standard practice for her!”
 

 
Old Bei was the screenwriter for ‘Emperor’s Meng’.
 

 
He’d spent two sleepless nights writing the plot around the Eastern Sea Pearl, sparking a rivalry between two ministers—only for the pearl to be handed off to the consort played by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Screenwriter: “The character model for Xie Guiya is your design, Cheng. You must feel my pain, right?”
 

 
Character designer: “Uh, well…”
 

 
Character designer: “But…isn’t her performance adorable? So…maybe it’s okay?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “?”
 

 
‘When I put a question mark, it’s not that I have a question—I think ‘you’ have a problem.’
 

 
It’s hopeless, bury it.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s practice scene in her room was a small solo martial arts sequence intended to captivate the audience and remind them that this is an action film. Clearly, she delivered. After a month of training, the choreography embedded by the action designer was no longer just a string of rigid moves—it had become an instinctive skill integrated into her subconscious.
 

 
The lead action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ commented, “Luckily, Fu Xuancheng’s lightfoot escape sequence appears first. Otherwise, after seeing the junior sister’s fight scenes, the audience wouldn’t be as captivated by his agility. Compared to her, he’s just performing the moves without depth.”
 

 
Director Shi nodded in agreement. “Her dedication has even earned praise from the masters.”
 

 
Through this brief father-daughter interaction, Xie Guiya’s character was already well-established. Next came a tightly paced dialogue scene, unveiling the movie’s central conflict and introducing the antagonist—Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
In ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, the villain and protagonist are complete opposites.
 

 
Xie Guiya’s mother is a strong and independent woman who, after divorcing her husband, single-handedly raised her son with the child support and her wages, occasionally calling her daughter. In stark contrast, Fu Xuancheng’s mother is a martial artist from a lineage that includes three generations of practitioners of a dark martial arts sect, while his father is a corrupt man involved in gambling, drugs, and other vices. Though his mother had the skills to protect herself, her intense love for her husband made her afraid that standing up to him would lead to his rejection, causing her to tolerate the domestic violence inflicted on her and her children.
 

 
Growing up in a twisted family, Fu Xuancheng’s inner self was like a dark green plant nourished in a swamp.
 

 
Like the protagonist’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, he loved reading martial arts novels. At some point, he even discovered that his mother was one of the legendary figures who knew mystical martial arts. Excited, he went to ask her about it, but instead of praise, he was scolded; his mother forbade him from ever bringing up martial arts again.
 

 
This was because Fu’s father preferred weak women.
 

 
More than that, on the very night that Fu’s mother received a promotion and a raise that put her income slightly above his, he humiliated her to shatter her self-esteem.
 

 
From that point on, Fu Xuancheng realized that his mother had the ability to resist and protect him.
 

 
But she simply chose not to.
 

 
Because her son was merely a tool to keep her husband around.
 

 
At that stage, young Fu did not turn dark; he accepted this logic.
 

 
It wasn’t until Fu’s father was laid off, gambled away his severance pay, got kicked out of an underground casino, drank at a street vendor without paying, and was beaten when he couldn’t cover the bill, that he returned home in disgrace. Furious, he turned on his wife and child who never fought back, yelling, “You think I suffer like this for my own sake?!” Then he beat Fu Xuancheng half to death. At that moment, Fu’s mother, pushed to her limit, resisted for the first time.
 

 
She had gone so long without using her martial arts, and the skills she had were of the most brutal, sinister type.
 

 
In her attempt to stop him, she accidentally killed the man she loved most.
 

 
No one cared about the disappearance of a social outcast like him, and Fu Xuancheng, being so young, had little experience in covering up a crime. He emptied out the refrigerator and struggled to fit his “father” inside. He thought that with his father gone, all their pain would end, that he could finally live a normal life like his classmates. But after he had healed, he came home from school one day to find his mother hanging from the ceiling.
 

 
She had followed the man she loved into another world.
 

 
So what was he left to be?
 

 
When the neighbors called the police due to the stench, and social workers came to take Fu Xuancheng away, he was still unable to understand. Desperate for answers, he searched frantically through his mother’s belongings and found the manual for her sinister martial arts techniques.
 

 
His views were the opposite of the heroine’s.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng believed his mother was completely wrong.
 

 
If she had wanted to keep his father, she should have subdued him with force from the start. Leaving a powerful weapon unused and hoping that love would change him was putting the cart before the horse.
 

 
Martial arts novels often touch on the question of wielding power for control or submission—
 

 
When such discussions arise, they pull the reader from the fantastical world of martial arts back to reality. But if they don’t discuss it, the stories feel somewhat unrealistic.
 

 
Under the influence of the dark martial arts manual, Fu Xuancheng’s ambitions became old-fashioned and somewhat out of place. He dreamed of unifying the martial arts world and becoming its supreme leader. Ironically, in modern times, almost no one practices martial arts; even fitness-based martial arts gyms—which lack any real martial arts skill—see barely any customers.
 

 
In the end, he would be unifying an empty, lonely world.
 

 
Two years ago, a so-called "grandmaster" claimed to be the head of the Xingyi Tai Chi sect. Fu Xuancheng, eager for a fight, raced to his door under the cover of night (by high-speed rail). It turned out the man was a fraud, just another con artist. Disappointed, Fu defeated him and returned home, resolving from then on to seek out real "martial artists," intent on challenging them to truly unify the martial arts world...
 

 
The actor playing Fu Xuancheng, Jiang Dang, is known for his eccentric personality in real life, endearingly nicknamed the "crazy beauty" by his fans. Jiang has a rather unusual mindset.
 

 
Reporters find it hard to interview him because he often seems lost in his own world, sporting a mischievous yet alluring smile while barely responding to questions. Fortunately, he’s well-behaved when it comes to reading the PR scripts his agent prepares for him. He’s managed to stay scandal-free, but his recent puzzling “scandal” came when he starred in a romance drama with a new actress. The variety show they later appeared on together had accepted a favor from the actress’s agent, hoping to create a romance buzz around them. No matter what he asked, the editing team planned to spin it as “cute” chemistry.
 

 
But his question was, “Do you think tomatoes really like being paired with scrambled eggs as a national favorite?”
 

 
By afternoon, the internet exploded, with fans assuming Jiang was shading the actress for trying to force a “couple” image with him. Later that evening, paparazzi reported that Jiang had ordered a simple boxed meal for dinner: tomato and scrambled egg over rice.
 

 
Well, that escalated quickly.
 

 
Fans abandoned the intended romance storyline and instead debated whether Jiang’s emotional intelligence might have been entirely spent on his beauty.
 

 
In the story, Fu Xuancheng arrives in Qin City to search for any remaining “martial artists.” He creates a series of sensational stunts, hoping to draw them out. His main target is none other than the last rumored “hero of China”—the heroine’s father.
 

 
But will these antics draw in the heroine?
 

 
The answer is no. It’s her boyfriend who takes the bait.
 

 
The screenwriter brags, “This move, you see, is a masterful way of sneaking around to our goal!”
 

 
The character designer gives him a slap on the back of the head, “Please, stop butchering idioms like that.”
 

 
Screenwriter: QAQ
 

 
So what exactly does Jiang Dang’s Fu Xuancheng do?
 

 
Under the screenwriter’s omnipotent guidance, every time Fu Xuancheng makes a scene, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen just happen to be there.
 

 
For instance, when Fu shatters the face of the iconic clock tower—Qin City’s prime dating spot—by shooting an arrow in broad daylight, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen are holding hands right below it. Shattered glass falls dangerously close to Cheng, but Tong swiftly pulls him into her arms, saying, “Be careful.”
 

 
The arrowhead is deeply embedded in the clock face.
 

 
Tong looks towards the direction the arrow came from, but all she catches is a glimpse of a trench coat vanishing around the corner.
 

 
Cheng’s eyes light up with excitement, eager to investigate. However, knowing his girlfriend dislikes his fascination with all things martial arts, he restrains himself. Only after seeing Tong home does he race back to the clock tower, channeling his inner detective and asking around if anyone has seen a man in a trench coat. By chance, he ends up asking Fu Xuancheng himself (minus his “getaway” trench coat).
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked, "Did you see the person who shot the arrow?"
 

 
Cheng Siwen shook his head honestly. "No, I didn’t. That’s why I want to find him!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked why he was so interested, noting that Cheng seemed far too innocent to be a police officer.
 

 
Cheng eagerly shared his thoughts, convinced the mysterious archer must be a true hero. "McCarthy said, 'If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it’s a duck.'"
 

 
“You really have a lot of free time,” Fu Xuancheng remarked with a sigh, then added, “But if you find him, what do you plan to do? What if he’s actually a bad guy?”
 

 
The two chatted aimlessly for a while. Perhaps Fu Xuancheng hadn’t had a casual conversation in a long time, or maybe Cheng’s guileless nature simply made people feel at ease. Fu eventually confessed, “I, too, am searching for real heroes in this city. I believe they’re out there.”
 

 
Someone like him.
 

 
Cheng nodded excitedly, thrilled to have found someone who shared his thoughts. This wasn’t just a random stranger; this was a kindred spirit!
 

 
Since the other person was a man, Cheng didn’t worry about his girlfriend getting jealous... although he had never actually seen her get jealous. She was always warm and gentle, occasionally patting his head affectionately.
 

 
After an awkward but heartfelt exchange, Cheng reluctantly left, casting longing glances over his shoulder, completely unaware that he’d just escaped a dangerous situation.
 

 
...
 

 
Originally, this scene was supposed to be Fu Xuancheng meeting the heroine. However, after some discussion, the crew felt it wouldn’t work.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s incredible ability to extract information, the actor playing Fu, Jiang Dang, would likely end up spilling every detail of his life, including his birthday and first love’s name. It felt much safer to send Cheng Siwen, with his innocent, straightforward nature. Unintentionally, the secondary male lead had become the perfect "tool" character, and the assistant director who recommended him to the team felt immensely proud.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s next move involved inviting a professor at the heroine’s university to create a calligraphy piece of the phrase “Invincible Solitude.”
 

 
In the classroom at that time, Cheng Siwen had woken up late and, sensing something was off, quickly ducked back down. Because he was lying in the last row, he only caught a quick glimpse before hiding, so Fu didn’t notice him.
 

 
This incident would later create a plot twist during a scene where they try to identify each other.
 

 
But then, the butterfly effect began to unfold.
 

 
The journalist Shuyi had long anticipated that her boyfriend’s curiosity about the "mysterious thief" would likely get him into trouble. She was far more attentive to him than her script required. With meticulous detail, she checked his class schedule and, noticing he hadn’t responded for a while after class, decided to look for him. She ended up running straight into the professor, who was being forced to write calligraphy, and Fu Xuancheng!
 

 
The first fight scene was about to erupt—
 

 
Screenwriter: “So, does this mean the character recognition scene I designed is scrapped again?”
 

 
Character Modeler: “Looks like it.”
 

 
Screenwriter: “Damn it.”
 

 
The screenwriter was frustrated, but then realized that this would be an impromptu fight scene, unscripted and unplanned by the action choreographer. This meant Shuyi’s moves would come entirely from her subconscious.
 

 
Without the guidance of a fight choreographer, most actors simply can’t pull off a convincing fight scene—this is widely acknowledged in the industry.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng is, after all, a grown man. Even without planned moves, he should be able to handle a young woman easily, right? The screenwriter knew that Shuyi had some martial arts training, but the difference in strength was still significant.
 

 
Director Shi frowned, sensing trouble. “Quick, come up with a reason why Fu Xuancheng can’t use his full strength! Have a passing student call the police, so we can wrap this up sooner!”
 

 
He needed to justify why Fu Xuancheng wouldn’t be able to defeat the not-yet-awakened heroine without disrupting the plot entirely.
 

 
Director Shi had seen Tong Zhao sparring with her junior disciples at the martial arts studio and knew her skills were extraordinarily sharp. But please, just don’t let her defeat the villain boss here and now!
 

 
…
 

 
The backstage crew was in chaos. On set, the dim classroom was lit only by natural light from the large windows, casting long shadows of Fu Xuancheng and Shuyi, creating a beautifully dramatic composition.
 

 
Shuyi immediately pulled out her phone to call the police.
 

 
But before she could press 110, a flying sword sliced through the air toward her, forcing her to dodge to the side.
 

 
“Oh?” Fu Xuancheng’s interest was piqued.
 

 
…
 

 
The assistant director was nervous. “We need to make Shuyi afraid somehow… this isn’t the right moment for dialogue between them! Can the modeler come up with something?”
 

 
“Absolutely,” the modeler replied confidently.
 

 
To handle various unexpected situations, the modeler had prepared numerous emergency codes.
 

 
…
 

 
Shuyi studied him.
 

 
He had a striking, devilishly handsome face. His high-bridged nose and thin lips gave him the classic look of a male lead in a novel, while his narrow, phoenix-like eyes flashed with an unsettling intensity that sent chills down one’s spine. Of course, while ‘Instinct’ could blur the line with reality, it couldn’t convey hundreds of words of internal monologue through a single flicker in someone’s gaze. However, inducing a shiver was much easier.
 

 
Under the influence of a pre-set program from the “Hand of God” crew, Shuyi’s back cooled perceptibly as Fu Xuancheng fixed his gaze on her with interest.
 

 
Huh?
 

 
An ordinary subconscious mind might have interpreted that sensation as fear.
 

 
After all, feeling a chill while facing a dangerous figure is a normal physiological response.
 

 
But Shuyi’s subconscious wasn’t afraid.
 

 
Though she didn’t know why and didn’t dwell on the reason, she simply didn’t fear the unknown threat in front of her. It felt as if she’d faced far graver dangers countless times, confronting ruthless warlords or shielding the defenseless from gunfire. Her principle was always to stand on the side of the vulnerable, of reason, and of justice.
 

 
Any physiological reactions the crew tried to trigger in her to provoke confusion or fear couldn’t stir even a hint of dread in her.
 

 
Not only did she refuse to retreat—she took a step forward and asked:
 

 
“Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want?”
# Chapter89
Who am I?
 

 
Where am I?
 

 
What should I do?
 

 
If this isn't an interrogation of a criminal, these three questions could even be quite philosophical, like the question a teacher asks students when choosing a career — what are your life goals? You probably need to first understand why we live before talking about life goals, and that's a never-ending question, something that could make you think for three hours while sitting on the toilet. Fortunately, most of us don't overthink it. Instead, we straightforwardly fill in a university's name as our life goal, and for work, there's a standard, one-size-fits-all answer: become a government official.
 

 
Unfortunately, Jiang Dang, the actor playing Fu Xuancheng, belongs to the type of person who tends to overthink.
 

 
Faced with this inquiry, he began thinking!
 

 
But while thinking, he also spoke: "You can dodge my throwing knives. You're not an ordinary person."
 

 
Shuyi denied it: "I'm just an ordinary college student with good physical fitness."
 

 
"Really? I don't believe it."
 

 
After saying that, Fu Xuancheng let go of the poor professor, his figure blurred, and in an instant, he was in front of Shuyi.
 

 
In films, the things martial arts can do are exaggerated for effect.
 

 
But the fundamentals remain the same.
 

 
It's like actors learning to swim—though the butterfly stroke remains the same, in an action movie, they can swim with the speed of a speedboat. Fu Xuancheng was fast, but Shuyi wasn’t slow either. Her dynamic vision clearly tracked his approaching trajectory, and she seized his arm, throwing him to the ground…
 

 
Without the support of a stunt module, Fu Xuancheng had the strength and speed, but he was unable to react in time or use his "high-level martial arts" to counter.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's mood was one of shock.
 

 
However, since his emotions and expressions often went off-kilter, his cold and handsome face remained calm as he looked up at Shuyi from below.
 

 
Shu Yi: "Please answer my question."
 

 
In the gentlest and most polite tone, she did the most brutal thing.
 

 
When investigating abused animals that couldn’t speak, Shu Yi frequently used her self-created "physical interrogation" method to get answers. After all, gentleness and respect are reserved for those who deserve it, while unrepentant criminals don’t need such treatment… In this regard, she might be a little "immoral."
 

 
...
 

 
The template master was sweating nervously: "This isn't working. Conventional reasons can’t deter Tong Zhao. She’s not afraid of the villain at all."
 

 
Does this scene need to be reshot?
 

 
A reshoot might make it even worse, since something that wasn’t scary the first time will only seem even more indifferent the second time in such a short period.
 

 
So, they had to give the villain a reason not to take action against the protagonist.
 

 
The sunset's fading glow cast its light over the two of them.
 

 
Director Shi thought for a moment: "If physiological reactions can't affect Tong Zhao, let's have the villain make the first move. Could that make Fu Xuancheng feel something for the protagonist?"
 

 
Other staff members exchanged looks of disbelief, thinking, ‘Is that even possible?’
 

 
No wonder he's a veteran director with experience in over ten instinctual films; his ability to think on his feet is outstanding.
 

 
Template Master: "I'll give it a try."
 

 
After all, there's nothing more difficult than manipulating Tong Zhao's subconscious!
 

 
---
 

 
Fu Xuancheng froze for about two or three seconds, while Shuyi kept her knee pressed on his arm. She turned to the professor and asked, "Professor, did he do anything to you?"
 

 
In Shuyi's mind, this was simply a villain attacking a university professor.
 

 
The professor's voice trembled, mixed with confusion: "He asked me to write a calligraphy for him, the content was 'Dugu Qiubai'..."
 

 
---
 

 
Where did this "garden baby" come from? Shuyi was speechless.
 

 
Then, the temporary code input by the template master took effect. Fu Xuancheng, who had been staring at Shuyi in astonishment, suddenly felt his heartbeat race and dopamine rush through him, making him feel a nonsensical sense of happiness. Under the influence of the bridge effect and dopamine, he couldn’t help but raise his left hand, which was not being controlled, to touch his chest to confirm the change in his heartbeat, but Shuyi, quick to react, caught his other hand.
 

 
Shuyi narrowed her eyes slightly.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, looking somewhat shy, said, "Do you want to hold my hand?"
 

 
In the back, the original partner Cheng Siwen, who had been watching this from the start: "?"
 

 
He thought this warrior had a problem, and it was a big one!
 

 
The crew didn’t expect this.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had mostly played the second male lead in idol dramas before, typically as the villain, where all he needed to do was display his handsome, wicked-looking face and deliver his lines. He didn’t need to immerse himself deeply into the role, nor had he ever tried to make the audience feel the rush of love through physiological means.
 

 
Everyone was caught off guard by how this guy was reacting...
 

 
Shuyi furrowed her brows: "I don’t want you to move around. I’ll tell the police later."
 

 
"No," Fu Xuancheng refused. "Although you're very cute, I can't let the police catch me."
 

 
After subduing the villain, a normal person's rational response would be to call the police immediately.
 

 
However, Shuyi’s subconscious was a bit different. She was more concerned with another matter: "Then tell me your purpose."
 

 
"You know martial arts. I can’t tell what style it is, but you practice well."
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's lips curled into an ambiguous smile, even a little flirtatious, as though he'd finally found someone special in a sea of people, and that someone was like him. Was there anything more joyful than this? Probably not.
 

 
He continued to speak to himself:
 

 
"I didn’t expect the person I was looking for to be such a young girl. Who's your master? I'd like to spar with you properly, but this place is obviously not suitable." He wore an expression of regret.
 

 
"I don’t know martial arts. I just have a healthy exercise routine.”
 

 
Shuyi emphasized again.
 

 
By pure chance, Shuyi's curiosity was piqued by this neurotic person who loved to chat a lot and make grand gestures. Her intuition told her that this was no ordinary madman. The two of them were about to continue talking, but at that moment, Cheng Siwen once again displayed his exceptional potential as a tool man. He...
 

 
He secretly sent a WeChat message to his classmates, asking them to bring over more security guards.
 

 
At this moment, with both the villain and the protagonist acting out at the same time, what a rare "normal person" Cheng Siwen was! The crew couldn’t help but sigh in relief, thinking that simplicity and peace are truly a blessing. The combination of a madman and a master of conversation could easily turn an action movie into a philosophical art film.
 

 
As the villain, Fu Xuancheng had much higher combat power than the protagonist in the early stages.
 

 
This could make up for his lack of technique.
 

 
Excited, he finally broke free from Shuyi's control and rolled over to engage in the first fight scene with her —
 

 
It was like an impromptu free-fight match without any weight class. Shuyi didn't want to kill him, and Fu Xuancheng didn't want to hurt her either, so the fight wasn't full of deadly blows. Instead, it was quite a spectacle. Her movements were agile, and despite her opponent having a slight physical advantage, she didn't fall behind. After being knocked down once, before Fu Xuancheng could take advantage of the situation, she performed a light and nimble kip-up, her waist arching as she sprung up. The short white T-shirt she wore lifted slightly, revealing a toned and tight abdomen, showcasing her strength and beauty.
 

 
---
 

 
The action choreographer's eyes remained glued to the scene, afraid to blink in case he missed even a moment: "Her moves are so perfect, no wonder she was personally trained by her master. Compared to her, Jiang Dang is just using brute force with the help of the coded 'golden finger.'"
 

 
The supervisor shifted his gaze to the director.
 

 
The one most passionate about action scenes here was Director Shi.
 

 
"I can't wait to start editing," Director Shi said, indicating that even he was impressed by Tong Zhao's fight scenes.
 

 
The raw, unedited footage looked a little chaotic because the real fight was intense, every punch landing with force, creating an exhilarating feeling. But through camera work and some montage techniques, they could highlight the elegant beauty of the movements.
 

 
However, they didn’t have much time to enjoy the fight scene. The security guards Cheng Siwen had called for were almost there. The two fighters heard the approaching footsteps in the hallway and the students' insistent calls: "Yes, it's this way!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng didn’t give her a chance to stop him. He quickly closed the distance, jumped lightly to the window, and as he did, he casually yanked out the hair tie holding her ponytail.
 

 
The hair tie fell into his hand, and Shuyi’s long hair tumbled down, the strands fanning out in an arc, unknowingly providing the director with a perfect shot. She looked up at him, and the disheveled hair added a softness to her previously cold demeanor.
 

 
Her coat fluttered in the wind, and the sunset had completely set behind the mountains.
 

 
The darkness swallowed half of his face, but the eye on his right side locked onto Shuyi: "Unfortunately, this is where our fight ends today. But I’m sure... you’re one of the people I’ve been looking for. I hope the next time we meet, we can fight until one of us is dead."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a light sparring?
 

 
Fu Xuancheng: "You must be a martial arts genius, just like me."
 

 
Shuyi: "..."
 

 
Favorability: -1-1-1.
 

 
She was too tired to explain that she was simply good at sports and had no martial arts skills at all!
 

 
With time running out, Fu Xuancheng kissed the hair tie, then leaped away with light steps, disappearing from the third floor.
 

 
The security guards and classmates almost arrived at the same time.
 

 
Cheng Siwen, who had gotten up from the back row, tugged at his girlfriend’s hand with a resentful expression, feeling a bit green, but Shuyi quickly reassured him with a few words, lifting his spirits again. He then turned his attention to another matter: "By the way, Guiya, so you’re really that good at fighting? What you used just now was Xingyi Quan, right?"
 

 
"It was the military boxing taught during military training."
 

 
"I saw it clearly—it wasn’t military boxing..."
 

 
"Then you must have seen it wrong."
 

 
Shuyi said decisively, her firm expression convincing her boyfriend.
 

 
...
 

 
At this point, the plot had already taken off like a wild horse, never to return.
 

 
But the protagonist was still doing what they were supposed to be doing, walking down what seemed to be the right path.
 

 
After a discussion, the core team of the crew felt that the changes were acceptable. Aside from the writer feeling a little emotionally slighted, the plot was moving forward as planned, and the three lead actors had unexpected interactions and chemistry. The key was that there were several scenes that the director thought would be a waste to reshoot. He and the team already had a rough idea for how to edit the footage in post-production.
 

 
"The only remaining issue is when to trigger Tong Zhao’s subconscious shift; there needs to be a catalyst."
 

 
As the discussion was winding down, the first portion of the shoot came to an end.
 

 
Since ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ has a significant time span within the storyline, for the health of the actors, the crew didn’t want to rush the actors and decided to set up some rest periods. The actors could wake up and rest in the studio dorms after they finished filming.
 

 
The lead actors woke up from the filming cabin.
 

 
Shuyi was a bit tired, so she directly handed over the position of the main personality to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned to her room to rest, she noticed that someone from the crew group had added her as a friend—
 

 
Jiang Dang?
 

 
He was the actor playing the antagonist.
 

 
"Why did he add me?"
 

 
After returning to her room, Tong Zhao accepted the request while casually saying this.
 

 
Consort Chen: [Maybe he wants to make a move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need for that.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Do you remember Song Wanzhuo? Maybe something happened between you two in the film, and its effect carried over into real life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment but felt that it didn’t seem quite right.
 

 
Jiang Dang wasn’t new to playing in instinct-based films; this kind of “getting into character” situation should be something he could handle himself—this was also a problem that many on-screen couples faced. The feeling of attraction generally faded away after filming wrapped: [Besides, he's the antagonist, not the male lead, and Shuyi isn't a concubine. She doesn’t “keep fish.”]
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, Director Shi sent a message and a sample file.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [Because of adjustments to the plot, we’ve added a romantic scene between you and Jiang Dang.]
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [There’s also another plot point that will need your second type of subconscious. Can you handle it?]
 

 
...
 

 
This was actually happening.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with a simple "Okay."
 

 
As soon as she sent the message, Jiang Dang’s WeChat call came through.
 

 
Was there something that couldn’t be typed out?
 

 
It was just a professional relationship, and Tong Zhao was a bit patient with him, so she answered the call and greeted him in a cheerful voice meant for fans: “Brother Dang, what’s up?”
 

 
Jiang Dang had debuted earlier than her, so using his full name felt a bit too unfamiliar... The entertainment industry, like any other network-based industry, often made it safe to address others with titles like "sister" or "brother."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I guess I shouldn’t be disturbing you at this time."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, indeed.
 

 
But Jiang Dang had an irresistibly seductive voice.
 

 
Even if she wasn’t a "voice person," just hearing him speak could instantly erase any irritation.
 

 
Every syllable was soft and lingering, even when he said something as ordinary as "Did you eat?" It felt like he was whispering sweet nothings. While ordinary people’s words vibrated in the ear, his voice slid past like a gentle caress...
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her ears tingle.
 

 
Jiang Dang spoke slowly, as if he couldn’t quite find the right words: "I don’t know why, but after I woke up from the cabin, I felt this strong urge to find you. I just had to find you."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't help but inwardly hiss.
 

 
Shuyi: [Is this my turn now?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Looks like our Shuyi has leveled up.]
 

 
“I wanted to ask if you have some free time. I really want to spar with you…”
 

 
It was as if he suddenly remembered something inappropriate to say, and his deep voice took on a shy tone, adding a touch of unspoken allure.
 

 
Could this be the legendary “let’s find a time to hook up” invitation?
 

 
Too direct, too forward.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect.
 

 
After all, “sex and food are human nature." While she wasn’t someone who easily got into relationships, she admired the other person’s frankness. It was a genuine, straightforward approach.
 

 
Consort Chen’s comment: [That kid, Wei, should learn from him. They could have had a couple of kids by now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What does this have to do with Zekai?]
 

 
Consort Chen smiled behind her fan and said nothing.
 

 
On the other end, Jiang Dang finally made up his mind and made a bold request to the female star he had just met:
 

 
"Would you spar with me?”
# Chapter90
“...Huh?”
 

 
Even Tong Zhao was momentarily stunned.
 

 
At her age, she had never heard of such a request.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If you really need something, you can discuss it with your manager first.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s words were somewhat tactful.
 

 
Mainly, because the two weren’t familiar with each other, she didn’t feel comfortable suggesting that he see a psychiatrist. But based on the movie script, his desire to fight seemed to be an impulsive moment. Once he talks to his manager, he’d probably calm down and realize how ridiculous he was being.
 

 
“Could it be...”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was more confused now. “Tong Zhao, do you think I’m not worthy of being your opponent by myself, and want me to bring my manager for a two-on-one?”
 

 
...
 

 
Well, well, well. Tong Zhao silently thought to herself.
 

 
She had been trained to be professional and managed to suppress the urge to laugh, but the other personalities in her mind were on the verge of cracking up.
 

 
Before she could steady herself and speak, Jiang Dang suddenly had an epiphany: “Ah, I get it now. I knew it.”
 

 
Well, if you understand...
 

 
Jiang Dang: “You want to bring my manager in as a referee, right?”
 

 
You understand ‘nothing’!
 

 
Tong Zhao tightened her grip on the phone, her fist clenching.
 

 
“We might cause rumors if we attend the same event together, so it’s better to discuss it with the manager first.”
 

 
Her side was quite relaxed; she just needed to report things.
 

 
Her manager didn’t restrict her socializing, but the whole team worked hard for her image, so naturally, it was her responsibility to cooperate and trust them to the fullest.
 

 
“Then it’s settled. Thank you.”
 

 
After Jiang Dang finished speaking, he quickly hung up the phone.
 

 
...
 

 
Huh?
 

 
It’s settled?
 

 
What kind of train of thought does this person have?
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, are you really going to fight him?]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Fighting a demon might be worth considering.]
 

 
[No,] Tong Zhao quickly stopped the wild idea from the consort, saying: [Actually, it’s not impossible… I mean, a fight, just as practice. I’ve fought with my junior disciples in the dojo before.]
 

 
Tong Zhao mentioned it to her manager.
 

 
Sister Chu was also stunned.
 

 
However, Jiang Dang’s reputation for being unconventional in the industry wasn’t surprising. Sister Chu said on the phone, “Maybe he’s interested in you. It depends on how you feel about him. I won’t interfere with that. Although his personality is a bit odd, it’s hard to resist someone with his looks and voice.”
 

 
Jiang Dang was one of the rare amphibious artists in the younger generation. His singing was more famous than his acting, and he became famous through his music.
 

 
It was said that when he first debuted, he wasn’t as eccentric.
 

 
There was a rumor in the industry that Jiang Dang loved singing so much that his manager once told him that in order to be a professional singer, he needed to speak less and protect his voice. After two years, when he became an overnight sensation, his manager, thinking that he was now a big star and should have the image of an idol, told him that it was fine if he talked more.
 

 
Once that seal was broken, there was no turning back.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s best-selling album became a hit all across Asia.
 

 
The promotional poster for this album features him wearing a soaked white shirt, his hands cuffed with a pair of silver handcuffs, and the lower half of his face firmly restrained by a black leather muzzle designed for vicious dogs. His naturally sinister face carries an indifferent expression, as if hiding a thousand-word love song behind his dark, wet eyes. The photographer adjusted the lighting to make the faintest hint of light shine in his eyes, adding an intense, unspoken depth to the emotion, as if he were struggling to hold it in.
 

 
Later, when asked what he was thinking while shooting this poster, Jiang Dang said, “The lighting technician seemed to want to shine the light directly into my eyes. I wanted to complain to my manager, but my mouth was covered by the muzzle.”
 

 
Countless fans fantasized about what kind of charming love words this fierce dog might speak.
 

 
Who could have imagined that, in the end, it would turn into a whole lot of dog talk.
 

 
Sister Chu said she bought the album and even saved the high-definition image of the poster to send to Tong Zhao. Since entering the industry, Tong Zhao had seen so many handsome men and beautiful women that she had become somewhat numb to them. The one who most matched her aesthetic was still Han Zhi in her mind. She wasn’t particularly moved by Jiang Dang’s looks and, after the phone call earlier, she began to think that he might not be that smart.
 

 
But he wasn’t like a Husky either.
 

 
Wei Zekai had more of that Husky vibe.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and pushed the thought aside.
 

 
...
 

 
So, what exactly was Jiang Dang’s reasoning behind making such a bold request?
 

 
At the time, he had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and the influence of his character Fu Xuancheng still lingered in his mind. However, the effect was minimal, something most actors would just ignore and laugh off. But Jiang Dang was no ordinary person. He was someone who acted on impulse, and after giving it some thought, he didn’t see anything unreasonable about the request.
 

 
A fight? What a perfectly legitimate invitation.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao "agreed" to his request, he was satisfied.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to consult with his manager, he obediently did so. — Fans liked to call him a "crazy beauty," but that wasn’t entirely accurate. Jiang Dang was actually quite willing to follow the rules; he just sometimes acted a little thoughtlessly, making him seem a bit wild in the rational, interest-driven entertainment industry.
 

 
After hearing his report, his manager fell silent for a moment. “Sorry, Jiang Dang, could you repeat what you want to do?”
 

 
He suspected his ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied in a particularly cheerful tone, “I want to spar with her!”
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, so it’s just that his artist has lost his mind. Well, that’s nothing unusual.
 

 
The manager knew he was filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ at the moment, so he advised, “Calm down. Don’t get too immersed in your character. She’s the last direct disciple of Director Deng! Even a 1.8-meter tall man can’t beat her. Have you studied martial arts?”
 

 
“Nope!” Jiang Dang replied in the same cheerful, refreshing tone.
 

 
The manager sighed heavily. “...You’ll get beaten to death!”
 

 
From his understanding of Jiang Dang, once the guy had a weird idea, he would become stubborn about it. The manager didn’t want to argue further, so he decided to find a chance to talk to Tong Zhao, pleading with her not to injure him too badly, or at least avoid hitting him in the face. If she could silence him, that would be great... No, wait, that wouldn’t work either—there was a concert scheduled mid-year, and his voice couldn’t be ruined.
 

 
Coincidentally, Jiang Dang’s manager, Aaron, had some connections with Sister Chu, so arranging this wouldn’t be a hassle.
 

 
Back to the filming work.
 

 
The actor playing the male lead’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, was a normal guy who didn’t have as much drama as Jiang Dang. He held a simple “the more friends, the more paths” philosophy and added Tong Zhao as a friend, then quietly laid low.
 

 
After resting for the entire day, everyone returned to holographic filming the next day, fully recharged and ready to go.
 

 
The villain Fu Xuancheng became entangled with the protagonist, played by Shuyi, and wanted to spar with her.
 

 
But she chose to blend into the crowd and avoid the fight, not even returning home.
 

 
During her entanglement with Fu Xuancheng, Shuyi, who believed that everything had an answer, proactively reached out to the so-called "martial artists." She encountered the Plum Blossom Swordsman, who, facing a midlife crisis, spoke with shining eyes when talking about his knife. He mentioned that if he saw his students studying too late and there was no one to accompany them home, he would secretly follow them using his lightness skill. Once, he was mistaken for a creepy stalker, and he had to work hard to escape the situation...
 

 
Gu Xiaopan, a descendant of the famous martial artist Jianghu Bai Xiaosheng, was a serious recluse. Even when food delivery arrived, she wouldn’t dare make eye contact with the delivery driver, insisting in her notes that the food be placed in a plastic basket by the door.
 

 
But she still knew a lot of information.
 

 
This was because Gu Xiaopan, though timid in real life, was a force to be reckoned with online.
 

 
Not only did she teach these older martial artists how to use computers and WeChat over the phone, but she also gained much information from the internet. By hacking into various surveillance systems, she narrowed down Fu Xuancheng’s movements.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan’s computer was filled with PSD files of “martial arts manuals.”
 

 
These used to be passed down only to trusted individuals.
 

 
Now, due to necessity, she had no choice but to share them, afraid that they would be lost forever.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan said, “I told the uncles and aunties that as long as the files are saved on the computer, they’ll last as long as the heavens and the earth. I have one copy on the cloud, one on the computer, and three more stored on different solid-state drives, all kept in a waterproof safe.”
 

 
Becoming a martial artist is too hard—practicing stances is no different from attending hobby classes.
 

 
After all, knowing lightness skill won’t give you extra points on the college entrance exam, and it can’t stop bullets or make you an outlaw. People like Fu Xuancheng and the protagonist are rare talents, one in a million.
 

 
The most important thing is that it doesn’t make money!
 

 
When the time and effort invested doesn’t bring proportional returns, the skill will disappear.
 

 
If no one learns it, what’s the difference from it being lost?
 

 
There are many types of urban knights, each with a different appearance.
 

 
The one thing they all have in common is their love for martial arts.
 

 
After the guerrilla warfare in the girls’ dormitory, Fu Xuancheng could no longer contain himself and made his move on Cheng Siwen.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was kidnapped to an abandoned school, where Fu Xuancheng forced him to send a message to the protagonist, luring her to come alone. After Cheng Siwen firmly refused, Fu Xuancheng had no choice but to send her a voice message—due to his father’s deliberate abuse, he hadn’t attended school much and could only recognize a few characters. At the time, he only understood the movements and principles in the secret martial arts manual.
 

 
He didn’t understand the warning left by previous masters, telling him not to learn it.
 

 
This was a turning point in the protagonist’s character arc, where, in the process of using the martial arts taught by his father to protect important people, he also came to accept that he actually loved martial arts.
 

 
As the protagonist saw her boyfriend injured, she was also provoked by Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
Just then, filming paused.
 

 
...
 

 
All the actors were still in a deep sleep, except for Tong Zhao, who had woken up.
 

 
A staff member thoughtfully handed her a warm towel to wipe her face. “In ten minutes, we’ll need to put your consciousness back into the scene. Do you need more time to prepare?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head. “I’m ready anytime.”
 

 
In stark contrast to Tong Zhao's full confidence, the director, assistant director, and the supervisor who ultimately supported the decision were all, without exception, extremely nervous, sweating with anxiety, worried that the desired effect wouldn’t be achieved. The assistant director comforted them, saying, “Even if it doesn't work out, the result will just be more ordinary, but not bad. Did you think the first half of the film was bad?”
 

 
“Of course it wasn’t bad.”
 

 
Shuyi portrayed a character who possessed extraordinary martial arts skills but was calm, reserved, and had a very modern mindset.
 

 
She was easier to like than the pre-set character of Xie Guiya, and her performance was very appealing.
 

 
“But in the last third of the story…” Director Shi’s gaze shifted to the frozen surveillance footage, which was now starting a sixty-second countdown. When it hit zero, the second phase of the consciousness deployment would be complete. “I want to see a protagonist with contrast, someone whose emotions are more outwardly expressive and vivid… Seriously, can you imagine Tong Zhao’s Xie Guiya pinning someone down and beating them up? She’s the type who would call the police after subduing a criminal. It’s hard to picture her executing extrajudicial punishment.”
 

 
The assistant director nodded in agreement and teased, “I can imagine her subduing the criminal and extracting all of his past secrets and little secrets out of him.”
 

 
...
 

 
The world inside the scene resumed its motion.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng waited for a while, but when there was still no reaction from the protagonist, he shook his head in utter disappointment. “You’ve got backup waiting, don’t you?”
 

 
Previously, Shuyi had always managed to stay one step ahead and had backup ready.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng guessed that this time would be no different.
 

 
As the still image came to life again, every crew member backstage became tense, fearing that Tong Zhao, like before, would be just as clever this time, always one step ahead and avoiding the fight. In fact, if it had been any other actor, there wouldn't be such an issue because, as long as the template master adjusted the adrenaline levels, the actor would act like a firecracker ready to go off, performing in ways that were more extreme and suited for the climax of the story...
 

 
But this trick didn’t work on Tong Zhao!
 

 
They were starting to suspect that Tong Zhao had undergone some special training, allowing her to ignore any physical discomfort and always make the optimal choice, no matter the situation.
 

 
This was unbelievable.
 

 
“Backup?”
 

 
In the scene, Tong Zhao, after helping the injured Cheng Siwen to the wall, slowly repeated the words “backup” in a soft voice.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng threw her a phone from a distance, reminding her, “You can still call the police.”
 

 
The supervisor was stunned. “What the hell? When did he get a phone?”
 

 
In the film, Fu Xuancheng, who had suffered from domestic violence and was so poor he couldn’t even afford basic necessities, had never really been in contact with electronics. He was a complete tech illiterate. Moreover, at this moment, handing a phone to Tong Zhao…
 

 
The assistant director slapped his forehead, suddenly remembering that Jiang Dang’s thought process was also a bit extraordinary.
 

 
“Call the police?”
 

 
At this moment, the Tong Zhao in the scene repeated his words again.
 

 
She caught the phone Fu Xuancheng had thrown at her.
 

 
Is she really going to call the police?
 

 
Everyone couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. The supervisor turned his head irritably, unable to tolerate Tong Zhao’s overly reserved subconscious behavior. Being refined is great, but here, they needed her to explode with emotion. Why was she holding back?
 

 
However, the next development made everyone’s eyes widen in shock.
 

 
They saw Tong Zhao stand up, let go, and the phone fell to the ground.
 

 
Then, with one swift step, she stomped on the phone, crushing it with a loud, forceful sound. The glass screen slammed against the uneven floor and shattered under the pressure, glass fragments scattering all over the place.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked the glass shards aside.
 

 
The crew held their breath, and Fu Xuancheng stared at her intently.
 

 
Screenwriter: “Wait, isn’t that her boyfriend’s phone?”
 

 
Template artist: “Enough, you’ve already broken the atmosphere.”
 

 
Fu Xuancheng stared at her for a moment, then asked:
 

 
“You clearly have excellent martial arts skills, yet you always avoid confrontation. Why?”
 

 
The crew members realized with a sinking feeling that, based on Tong Zhao’s subconscious behavior earlier, this was a sign that she was about to have a conversation!
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head and looked up.
 

 
The moonlight fell into her eyes, shattering into pieces.
 

 
Her delicate face showed no smile, and her facial features were tense and sharp, forming cold, ruthless lines.
 

 
No words were necessary— even through the cold screen, every viewer could feel her anger.
 

 
The template artist silently gasped in shock, quickly checking the backstage data to see if he had administered too much hormone to her. How was the effect so strong? But no, the data clearly showed that the dosage was appropriate, just enough to make an average worker—who would normally endure a 996 work schedule—stand up to his boss and argue reasonably.
 

 
But it shouldn’t have made her look like she was ready to kill someone, right?
 

 
In the next moment, the Tong Zhao on the surveillance footage lunged forward!
# Chapter91
Is this really the same person?
 

 
At this moment, both the crew and the villain were questioning their very souls.
 

 
The final battle had a pre-set action template, designed so that "once the mind makes a move, the brain and body already have a complete set of actions ready." It's like playing a video game where, after thousands of rounds, certain combos like "a1, a3, a3" become instinctive—no thinking required, just ensuring a spectacular performance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Fu Xuancheng flying!
 

 
The director, still somewhat composed, said, "It's okay, we were always going to adjust many of the camera angles in post-production. This moment is quite impactful."
 

 
The action designer had also prepared many templates to guide him.
 

 
In short, the movie crew had gone to great lengths to ensure that an actor who had never studied martial arts could still pull off a thrilling action scene. It was almost like playing a rhythm game, but the tricky part was that Tong Zhao didn't play by the usual rules... her subconscious mind had actual skills! The fight scenes she delivered were truly hard-hitting and incredibly impressive!
 

 
But directing her—well, that was both a painful and thrilling challenge.
 

 
So, what did the action designer do?
 

 
Of course, he didn’t give up!
 

 
"Alright, Fu Xuancheng being kicked away was within my calculations," said the action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ as his fingers flew over the control panel, so fast that his fingers blurred. "I anticipated that Tong Zhao's subconscious wouldn't follow the plan, so I prepared several backup options just waiting for her to make her move!"
 

 
Everyone else looked at him with admiration.
 

 
Now ‘that’ is professionalism.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, who had been kicked away, took less than a second to recover and switch to a defensive stance, preparing to strike. However, Tong Zhao was even faster. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, she appeared right in front of him. Fu Xuancheng's heart raced—there was no time to dodge!
 

 
Outside the scene, the action designer smirked coldly. "Don’t underestimate my reaction speed. I played professional e-sports for a year!"
 

 
The action coding input in the backstage system would precede the brain's instructions—this is what’s known as a "subconscious action." This type of movement doesn’t appear often in regular dramatic scenes, as actors might start doubting their mental state if it happens too frequently, potentially hindering the performance. However, in high-frequency action scenes, there's no such worry. Fu Xuancheng would only think that his experience made him so skilled that his body instinctively reacted before his mind could process it.
 

 
With the action designer’s help, Fu Xuancheng narrowly sidestepped, avoiding a fatal strike. Only his shoulder was hit.
 

 
It was a wooden sword, but the dull pain it caused was no less intense than that of a metal blade.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s entire body tensed as he lowered his stance, locking eyes with her.
 

 
Unexpectedly, she didn’t go for a quick attack. Instead, she stood still, glancing up at Fu Xuancheng, her hand still gripping the wooden sword.

Within the story, Duan Ge, upon regaining consciousness, received the full character memory.
 

 
Duan Ge had never been a mindless killer. On the contrary, leading her companions to survive in the post-apocalyptic world required constant avoidance of conflict, only striking decisively and precisely when absolutely necessary. Killing one person should be equivalent to killing ten—she wasn’t a sadist. However, the personality shaped by extreme conditions didn’t quite fit with the peaceful times.
 

 
Let me give an example.
 

 
In peaceful times, an ordinary person, when enraged to the point of explosion, would slap someone across the face.
 

 
In extreme conditions, Duan Ge, when enraged to the point of explosion, would want to knock someone’s head off and kick it like a soccer ball.
 

 
Right now, Duan Ge really wanted to twist off the head of the person who had hurt her boyfriend and kick it around.
 

 
“You’ve asked for a fight again and again.”
 

 
“To be honest, I don’t like martial arts at all, and I despise violence. I can’t understand creatures like you who take pleasure in combat.”
 

 
“Alright then…”
 

 
She stretched her arms and then, with her palm facing up, made a beckoning gesture at him.
 

 
“I’ll let you experience the essence of traditional martial arts—until you’re dead.”
 

 
As she spoke, Duan Ge smiled.
 

 
The curve at the corner of her eyes was both charming and violent.
 

 
---
 

 
Whenever action scenes appeared, it was the time for the action designer to shine.
 

 
Everyone else could only remain quiet and try not to disturb his work.
 

 
“Hmph, just you, Tong Zhao, I’ll see how you fight me!”
 

 
“Ah, hasn’t Jiang Dang’s physical condition been enhanced? Why is he still so weak?”
 

 
“Template designer, template designer, can you adjust the backstage data again? Oh, and how about activating a blood lock cheat for him!”
 

 
The entire backstage was filled with the increasingly insane and unreasonable demands from the action designer.
 

 
The template designer weakly raised his hand. “Uh, it’s already set to the maximum. I really can’t activate any more cheats…”
 

 
The action designer couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Even with his help, Fu Xuancheng still couldn’t defeat Tong Zhao!
 

 
How could there be a female star with such superior combat skills?
 

 
Does this girl really just run errands for her schedule instead of competing in mixed martial arts?
 

 
A deep sense of defeat enveloped him.
 

 
In front of him stood a mountain called Tong Zhao, one that he could only look up to, but could never overcome.
 

 
---
 

 
Because the movie’s main character, while searching for information on the villain, had come across many martial arts secrets, greatly enhancing her strength, she had also begun to accept this “family tradition.” She had studied longer than Fu Xuancheng, who started later, but had always been unwilling to admit that she was so powerful.
 

 
The first two-thirds of the story were about “this protagonist being incredibly strong yet overly cautious.”
 

 
And the climax, when it finally erupted, was especially satisfying.
 

 
And the villain? The villain was the one who made the audience feel good.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was beaten half to death, and Duan Ge was injured a bit.
 

 
The action designer, who initially wanted to manipulate the villain to defeat the protagonist, then aimed for a draw, and in the end, compromised to the humble goal of "don't ruin that handsome face..."
 

 
Duan Ge handed Fu Xuancheng over to the police, and before leaving, he grabbed her hand. "Didn’t we agree to fight until one of us dies?"
 

 
"The times have changed, big bad wolf."
 

 
Duan Ge tilted her head and gave him a heroic smile.
 

 
---
 

 
Later, because Fu Xuancheng didn’t actually kill anyone and was a minor (Duan Ge: "He’s that young???"), the authorities chose to let him off lightly. A relevant organization helped him return to school, saying he wanted to be the protagonist’s junior and wanted to pursue her.
 

 
Duan Ge said: "With your IQ, that’s unlikely, but you can come to my martial arts school to become my disciple."
 

 
After much consideration, the protagonist reconciled with her father and decided to take over the martial arts school.
 

 
One person couldn’t handle it alone, so Jianghu informant Gu Xiaopan (who had previously been at home) found another place to squat—she came to her martial arts school. Together, they began researching whether traditional martial arts could be adapted into a more manageable version—one that was less grueling but still strong for the body.
 

 
In the torrent of the times, what gets washed away isn’t necessarily the weak or unworthy, but more likely what doesn’t fit the new era’s standards. It’s still good. The protagonist resisted martial arts because what her father taught her was in stark contrast to what she was taught in school. As a young child, she was like a diode, and she firmly believed that it should be discarded.
 

 
After a series of dangerous yet somewhat amusing events, the protagonist came to terms with two things in her heart.
 

 
The story ended on a satisfying note.
 

 
The screenwriter was at a loss for words: "Although... but... however..."
 

 
What should he say?
 

 
The ending was fitting.
 

 
But it seemed like the process had nothing to do with what he originally wrote.
 

 
A huge sense of disappointment enveloped him, but thinking about the payment that had already been deposited into his account made it feel a bit better. After all, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t a film that focused on the screenwriter; everything was based on whether Director Shi Dingjun was satisfied, and it seemed like he couldn’t wait to start editing the final cut.
 

 
Unlike traditional films, the most tedious part of instinct films was the pre-production and post-editing. The actual filming with the actors was much quicker.
 

 
Everyone was celebrating the successful conclusion.
 

 
Indeed, the joys and sorrows of people do not really connect!
 

 
As the screenwriter reflected in his melancholy, his gaze met that of the action designer, who was sitting dejectedly. In that brief moment when their eyes locked, it felt like two lonely whales tuning into the same wavelength. They shared a common formidable opponent. Even though the work had come to a satisfying conclusion, they couldn’t feel happiness—only overwhelming defeat. Their gazes seemed to offer each other solace, almost sparking something…
 

 
But it really felt way too ‘gay’.
 

 
The two, who were both very rigid in terms of their inclinations, simultaneously turned away with expressionless faces.
 

 
How should one describe this feeling?
 

 
It’s like the screenwriter playing mid-lane, and Tong Zhao playing jungle. The jungle keeps taking all the screen time from the mid-lane, and in the end, Tong Zhao economically dominates, carrying the whole game and easily securing the star of the match. Meanwhile, the screenwriter just coasts along, winning without contributing much, and ends up being slaughtered by the enemy team…
 

 
Did they win the game?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
Are the teammates happy?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
But him? 0/22/0, face down in defeat, with no game experience.
 

 
Not only unhappy, but a bit wronged as well.
 

 
"If it weren't for Tong Zhao being so tired, I’d really want to go over the replay with her."
 

 
"Yeah, I didn’t expect her subconscious to have such explosive power."
 

 
The crew excitedly discussed the raw footage.
 

 
Movies are ultimately art and need to be exaggerated, but sometimes instinctive films can be too realistic and fail to achieve those exaggerated twists. Tong Zhao’s subconscious, though, pulled it off! It was like the saying, "You look five pounds heavier on camera." If she looks so slim on screen, how thin must she be in real life? This led to a discussion about Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
The stagehand said, “But I think Xiao Zhao is really friendly.”
 

 
“Yeah, she’s just an ordinary person. Except for being a bit quiet, she doesn’t put on airs.”
 

 
“I’m a fan of hers…”
 

 
The screenwriter felt that his friendship with the template designer had reached its end.
 

 
No, there was still one person—this person’s feelings should be just like his!
 

 
The screenwriter thought of Jiang Dang, who had been beaten up badly.
 

 
Well, once Jiang Dang regains his memories from the film, maybe he should chat with him for a bit.
 

 
---
 

 
Since she had to rush off for other engagements, Tong Zhao didn’t stay long in Qin City after waking up from the cabin. She took the earliest flight back to the company, and as soon as she landed, she was taken to the studio to shoot for a magazine cover. Jiang Dang, on the other hand, had three days off and spent a whole night resting at the Qin City Film Studio. At the celebration banquet, he finally met the screenwriter, who seemed eager to talk.
 

 
The screenwriter had deliberately arranged to sit next to him and said, "Sigh, it seems like you’re the only one who understands how I feel!"
 

 
Jiang Dang nodded, "Yes, we're both eating steamed bass."
 

 
---
 

 
The screenwriter was exasperated, "I mean ‘feelings’."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked back at him honestly, "Is there something different about your bass?"
 

 
The table just happened to have a big dish of steamed bass, and they coincidentally both took a bite. Wasn’t it the "same feeling"? The screenwriter remembered the rumors about Jiang Dang’s unusual thought process, but in the entertainment industry, he always only believed half of the rumors: "Maybe I wasn’t clear earlier. I mean the feeling of you being beaten half to death by Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jiang Dang’s expression subtly changed.
 

 
Seeing this, the screenwriter immediately got excited.
 

 
"Right? I hit a nerve, didn’t I?"
 

 
"Let’s hug and cry together, licking each other’s wounds!"
 

 
"Has she hit you before?" Jiang Dang asked, his gaze darkening slightly, a bit inexplicably displeased.
 

 
The screenwriter was taken aback. "No, not really."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Jiang Dang leisurely picked up a piece of tender bass, dipped it in white sugar, and ate it. His devilishly handsome side profile and elegant eating style couldn’t suppress the screenwriter's sense of nausea at seeing this scene… Maybe the problem with this guy wasn’t his thought process, but his taste buds.
 

 
The screenwriter decided to get to the point. "Doesn't it hurt, getting beaten like that by her?"
 

 
After chewing slowly and savoring, Jiang Dang turned his gaze back to him.
 

 
Jiang Dang had eyes that were as steady as a rock in a world of vanity, with a heart that seemed to hold deep thoughts and layers of meaning, not a complaint like "I can't believe bass goes with sugar—this is so gross, I got duped again."
 

 
The screenwriter felt his heart skip a beat under his gaze.
 

 
No wonder he was called the "godly face" of the music industry... Unlike when he looked at the action designer, this time the screenwriter felt that sexual orientation didn’t need to be so rigid. If the person in question was Jiang Dang, he could be flexible!
 

 
"It doesn’t hurt," Jiang Dang said with a slight curve of his lips, his eyes flashing with a mad excitement. "I actually like it. I want her to hit me again. You said our feelings are the same... Do you want to have a spar with her too? If you really want it, I can help you get in touch with her manager, but whether she agrees is up to her."
 

 
---
 

 
"No thanks."
 

 
"I don’t mean to monopolize her, you know."
 

 
Seeing the change in the screenwriter’s expression, Jiang Dang thought maybe his face was too intimidating. He tried to soften his tone.
 

 
"Mm, mm, really no need, thank you, thank you."

The screenwriter turned to the modeling supervisor and asked, "Can we switch seats?"
# Chapter92
While others were celebrating, Tong Zhao was still hard at work.
 

 
After two non-stop days, her assistant was so exhausted that every step felt like walking on clouds, stumbling along in a daze. It was no surprise—Tong Zhao, a superstar like her, setting aside an entire month to focus on rigorous training was incredibly rare. It showed a deep love for her craft and earned her praise within the film industry, as well as approval from critics.
 

 
After all, in both traditional and instinctive cinema, audiences ultimately want to see actors put themselves through the wringer in the name of "artistic dedication."
 

 
Many times, Tong Zhao suggested her assistant go home and get some rest.
 

 
The assistant firmly refused, saying, "If Sister Zhao isn't resting, how can I?"
 

 
"I could go a whole week without sleep."
 

 
Tong Zhao, having only slept four hours in the past two days, shot her a look. Her small, sharp face looked as energetic as if she'd had a full eight hours of sleep, making the assistant almost believe that people might not need sleep after all. "Sister Zhao, stop joking. Let’s get through this last set of shots, and then we can go home and rest."
 

 
"Alright," Tong Zhao replied, closing her eyes again.
 

 
This shoot had a rugged, cold theme, requiring her to wear military fatigues and give the camera a fierce expression. For her, it was effortless—no acting required, just posing naturally. Since she started training in spiritual cultivation, she barely needed sleep, but the less she slept, the worse her mood got...
 

 
Before shooting, Tong Zhao sat fully equipped in a corner, completely uninterested in interacting with anyone. Sunglasses and mask on, she looked like a mysterious character.
 

 
Over time, with the success of one hit film after another, Tong Zhao’s status in the industry had quietly risen.
 

 
She now had every right to assert herself.
 

 
Of course, in the entertainment world, even her modest setup wasn’t anything remarkable. Though she had graciously treated the entire crew to milk tea upon arriving at the studio, the gesture didn't really sway opinions much. For her, it wasn’t worth the energy to manage her image too meticulously.
 

 
In fact, at times, letting people assume she had a bit of a temper wasn’t such a bad thing.
 

 
Now, the staff around her recognized her growing influence and quietly adjusted, moving more carefully, keeping conversations low, not wanting to disrupt her. This unspoken courtesy allowed Tong Zhao to relax and rest for a moment.
 

 
After finishing the photoshoot, Tong Zhao removed her makeup and, too tired to trek back to her faraway apartment, decided to check into a bay-view suite at a nearby Hilton. She went straight to sleep, planning to figure out her next move when she woke up.
 

 
After she woke up, her agent called, asking where she was.
 

 
When Tong Zhao answered, Sister Chu chuckled, "Good choice of room—I was just about to discuss a little matter with you."
 

 
It turned out to be about housing.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's rapid rise in the industry, her current single apartment—which was perfectly fine for a newcomer—was no longer suitable. For both her image and security, a new home was in order. "I’d wanted to bring this up for a while, but things kept getting delayed."
 

 
As status rises, so must every aspect of one’s lifestyle—housing, clothing, transportation.
 

 
"No problem."
 

 
After a short understanding reply, Tong Zhao got up from bed. "Arrange someone to take me to check out some homes. I’d rather not pick out an entire neighborhood myself."
 

 
Sister Chu laughed, "Of course, I'll make sure you’re set up with something excellent."
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished washing up and applying a bit of makeup for going out, the driver and entourage were already waiting downstairs.
 

 
The property Sister Chu selected for her was a single-unit-per-floor high-rise in a prime location with first-class security and privacy. Naturally, the price and maintenance fees were steep, but at this point, they were necessities for Tong Zhao, who was never one to shortchange herself.
 

 
The new property was a massive flat with eight rooms and four living areas.
 

 
The sales agent, sharp-eyed and professional, emphasized the privacy features of Yu Long Xuan and the in-house cleaning team, which could be used for an additional fee. This way, there was no need to risk hiring unreliable outside services. He added with a smile, “And even if someone hires an external cleaning service, it’d be difficult for them to get in here without being escorted by the owner or tenant.”
 

 
Tong Zhao believed him.
 

 
Just getting in herself had felt like passing through multiple security gates.
 

 
After viewing the property, she was thoroughly satisfied and didn’t feel the need to shop around further—she went straight ahead and paid the down payment.
 

 
In fact, she could afford to pay the full price by cashing out some of her shares and investments. But rather than pay all at once, she preferred to let that few million yuan work for her, earning returns instead of saving a bit of interest.
 

 
"Whew..."
 

 
Now all that was left was arranging for the moving company.
 

 
Once the paperwork was done, she could move in as soon as the master bedroom was ready; it would definitely be more comfortable than a hotel.
 

 
Relieved, Tong Zhao shared the news with her friends in a group chat: "I’m officially someone with a mortgage now!"
 

 
Friend A: "Sounds so novel—I want to try it too."
 

 
Friend B: "Can’t wait to visit your new place, Zhao!"
 

 
Friend C: "Where’d you buy it?"
 

 
After chatting and laughing with them for a while, she messaged Wei Zekai privately, who had been trying to play dead: "Stop pretending. What's your connection to Yu Long Xuan?"
 

 
Good properties usually sold out before construction was even complete.
 

 
The unit Tong Zhao bought had never been lived in—it was brand new.
 

 
Although Yu Long Xuan was absurdly expensive, it was considered “prime real estate,” targeted toward the city’s wealthy residents. And the city was not short of wealthy people. Although Sister Chu had plenty of influence in the entertainment industry, this deal went beyond her reach. So Tong Zhao suspected Wei Zekai had something to do with it. After the incident with ‘Neptune Hunt’ and the previous rumors, her manager still had his contact info.
 

 
Wei Zekai confessed honestly: "My uncle is in real estate, and I asked Sister Chu if you needed to move. When Yu Long Xuan was finished, we set aside a batch of the best units, which weren’t publicly available. Don’t be mad."
 

 
Her manager probably just thought she’d recommended a decent property.
 

 
Little did she know it’d rack up such a big favor.
 

 
"I’m not mad; I should’ve asked you, honestly. You know this stuff better." Tong Zhao wasn’t one to fuss over debts with someone who genuinely cared for her. Besides, she and her childhood friend had built up so many mutual favors over the years that there was no point in keeping score.
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Know it better, my ass! I don’t know real estate."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "So, what do you know?"
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Entrepreneurship!"
 

 
…
 

 
Sometimes, Tong Zhao found it hard to tell if he was joking or dead serious.
 

 
In any case, the moving company quickly transported her belongings from the old apartment to her new home. With the numerous layers of paperwork and approvals involved in buying a luxury home, word about her purchase inevitably leaked to the media. Considering her current film fees and endorsement income, it was clear that purchasing a luxury property like Yu Long Xuan was a bit of a stretch for her budget.
 

 
Experts among the public didn’t take long to calculate her approximate income and compare it to the price of the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan.
 

 
The gap was at least several million yuan.
 

 
On Weibo and various forums, netizens were buzzing with surprise at her extravagant spending.
 

 
- “My whole family is shocked by her wealth—how can she have so much money?”
 

 
- “The genre of ‘immersive cinema’ is a huge market—either you profit big or lose big. Tong Zhao’s films have all been hits, and her pay rate must be sky-high by now. Her fan base alone wouldn’t cover this; it’s really her good relationship with audiences and her knack for picking the right projects.”
 

 
- “Sure, the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan is expensive, but there’s no rule saying she had to pay it all at once! If it’s just the down payment, her income could definitely cover it.”
 

 
Up to this point, the discussion remained positive.
 

 
But it’s the internet—how long can that positivity really last?
 

 
Faced with an apparently perfect celebrity, some netizens started saying, “Really? I don’t believe it,” digging deep for anything suspicious. They uncovered a leak from the bank confirming that Tong Zhao had taken a mortgage rather than paying in full.
 

 
Netizens began wondering why she’d need such a large place.
 

 
-“Maybe she’s just used to living in luxury. When she left her family, she moved from a mansion to a low-cost apartment.”
 

 
- “And now, she’s worked her way back up to an even better mansion! So inspiring, Zhao Zhao! [crying emoji]”
 

 
- “I wish her lousy dad could see this.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming did see it.
 

 
It was hard to miss—even though he only read print newspapers, he couldn’t escape news about his eldest daughter’s latest movie. There was even a giant billboard across from his company featuring her face, all made up and strikingly beautiful, seeming to look down on his business. Every time he saw it, it irritated him to the point where just the sight of Xu Zhu bothered him.
 

 
How could two children from the same family turn out so different?
 

 
Tong Zhenming couldn’t figure it out.
 

 
When he couldn’t make sense of it, he’d go home and take his frustrations out on Xu Zhu, sometimes even physically, though he had held back recently, as her wedding was coming up. She was marrying into the He family; their young master had few options after experiencing a strange wave of setbacks in business. Faced with her father’s plan to marry her off as the second wife of a wealthy older businessman, Xu Zhu settled on the He family as a last resort.
 

 
To support the marriage alliance, Tong Zhenming bought her an apartment, fully paid as part of her dowry.
 

 
Since paparazzi couldn’t dig up any new stories on Tong Zhao, they turned their focus to the father-daughter duo. Even a single unpleasant comment from them would make a juicy headline.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was moving around like an urban hermit, as though in hiding. She had already completed her publicity tour and magazine covers, leaving her largely untraceable while public interest in her was at a fever pitch.
 

 
…
 

 
On Xu Zhu’s wedding dress shopping day, she barely made it out of the store when three people jumped out from the roadside.
 

 
“Xu Zhu, I’m a reporter from Papaya Media. I have a few questions for you.”
 

 
Xu Zhu had never experienced anything like this and clung to her father’s arm in fright.
 

 
When she had been an idol, she hadn’t been particularly famous; the few interviews she had were orchestrated by the company to generate hype.
 

 
“What are you doing!” Tong Zhenming snapped, his eyes flashing with anger.
 

 
Normally, Tong Zhenming wouldn’t accompany Xu Zhu on outings. But today, he planned to take her for wedding dress shopping and then join the He family for a dinner between the two families, so he decided to come along. Little did he know this would land him in hot water.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhenming there too, the three paparazzi reporters became even more excited, their eyes lighting up as if they’d struck gold.
 

 
“What are your thoughts on Tong Zhao buying a high-end A1 unit at Yu Long Xuan after publicly severing your father-daughter relationship?” one reporter fired off rapidly. “Are you considering helping her out financially?”
 

 
The public announcement of his estrangement from his eldest daughter had been one of the most humiliating moments of Tong Zhenming’s life. His expression changed instantly. “Are you crazy? What she does has nothing to do with me. I don’t acknowledge her as my daughter! Why should I support her?”
 

 
People who aren’t used to dealing with the media often get caught off guard. Whether they deny or react with shock, it just creates more material for journalists to exploit.
 

 
Sensing a newsworthy moment, one reporter gave a sly smile and added fuel to the fire. “That’s quite a statement. By the way, is it true that Miss Xu Zhu is getting married soon?” he asked, noticing they had just stepped out of a lavish bridal boutique. “Just curious—are you being fair in providing dowries?”
 

 
Another reporter chimed in, “Tong Zhao is paying off her house through a mortgage.”
 

 
Their questions were loaded with insinuations and structured to provoke, giving Tong Zhenming little room to answer gracefully. In frustration, he raised his voice, shouting, “Impossible! Not a single cent will go to her. I only have one daughter, Zhu Zhu, and I’ve paid for her home in full.”
 

 
Xu Zhu, who had been unwillingly thrust into the spotlight, forced herself to smile and nod for the reporters. “My father treats me very well, but support also brings responsibility. I’ll make sure to take care of him, as well as for my sister’s share,” she added sweetly.
 

 
She had no intention of being photographed looking unpleasant.
 

 
Perfect! That was exactly what the reporters wanted.
 

 
The journalists exchanged glances, and just then, the driver, who had been circling the mall for ages to find parking, finally arrived. The reporters rushed into the car as if they’d been rescued, and sped off, leaving the Tong family trio in relative peace, all of them breathing a sigh of relief.
 

 
Tong Zhenming’s round face was flushed red with anger as he continued ranting about his eldest daughter. “Always stirring up trouble! She’s the one who announced our estrangement, yet I’m the one facing all the hassles? Ridiculous! Buying a place at Yu Long Xuan—who does she think she is? And if she can’t make her mortgage payments and comes begging me, I won’t lift a finger!”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt somewhat appeased.
 

 
She wanted a place at Yu Long Xuan herself. The neighbors there were all wealthy, the ocean view was stunning, but her father wouldn’t buy one for her, and her husband’s family…well, perhaps if she gave them a son and their business continued to do well, they might buy one for her husband. But it certainly wouldn’t be in her name.
 

 
At least, her own pre-wedding home had been paid for in full.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually dared to take out a mortgage?
 

 
"Nothing blooms for a hundred days. In the entertainment industry, a star who rises to fame at the beginning of the year might already be fading by the end of it."
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched the hem of her dress, trying not to think about the possibility that the powerful Wei family’s eldest son might support ‘that’ woman financially…
 

 
If only she had the choice, she’d want to marry into the Wei family too.

"The Ultimate Triumph of the Mistress! Tong Zhenming Prepares a Full Dowry for His Youngest Daughter, Declares He Won't Give a Dime to Tong Zhao"
 

 
Bala Media, with a bit of a Hong Kong tabloid vibe, used sensationalist headlines designed to attract clicks. Known for ignoring PR maneuvers and focusing solely on what draws viewers' attention, this media outlet prioritizes shock value over integrity or morals. Their report cast Tong Zhenming and his younger daughter, born of his mistress, back into the spotlight, where netizens once again condemned them. By the time people suggested that Tong Zhenming should’ve kept quiet, it was already too late.
 

 
With a father like him, there were hardly any accusations left that painted Tong Zhao as ungrateful or extreme.
 

 
In the public eye, Tong Zhao—having to take out a loan to afford her first property without any help from her family—came across as someone to be pitied, almost tragic.
 

 
But this also posed an image problem for her.
 

 
After all, she was carving out a multi-talented career, aiming to be a figure of admiration for her fans.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao herself...
 

 
“I don’t need fans to worship me as some kind of deity, but I also don’t want anyone thinking I’m a pitiable figure,” she said coolly in a company meeting, seated at the head of the table, her sunglasses still on. Only the lower half of her face was visible—perfectly defined and framed by vivid red lips, which parted to deliver her next words calmly.
 

 
“This is the perfect opportunity to reveal that I have other businesses.”
 

 
While she would have preferred for her “past” to stay quiet, if they kept stirring things up, then she'd take advantage of the situation. No news story would bring her down, and no mud-slinging would stick to her name for more than a day.
# Chapter93
What Does It Mean to Live Well?
 

 
Throughout history, being adored by men has often been the benchmark of a woman’s success. Even a wealthy woman without a happy marriage or children isn’t seen as fully fulfilled; her "crown" seems less radiant. People may talk about her with regret, and the tabloids may mock her.
 

 
While this is the kind of lowbrow behavior we often see from certain tabloids, it reflects a deeply ingrained attitude. Many people, influenced by traditional views on fatherly or marital support, still equate a woman's security with having either a supportive father or a devoted husband. If she lacks one, people hope she at least has the other.
 

 
As a result, many of Tong Zhao's casual fans are eager to see her in a dream-like relationship, perhaps even a lavish wedding to a wealthy partner. It would be, to them, the perfect rebuttal to her neglectful father.
 

 
“Come on,” one fan wrote, “those who pity Tong Zhao clearly don’t know who her admirers are! Look at Wei Zekai’s feelings for her on that variety show. Marrying into wealth is just a matter of time.”
 

 
“Her dad? Please, everyone knows he doesn’t even deserve to shine Wei’s shoes,” another commenter added. “Honestly, I think Wei’s family has been making things difficult for the Tong family’s business lately.”
 

 
Fans spoke confidently, sometimes acting as if they knew more about her life than she did.
 

 
Some of them even used this moment to promote fan fiction, shipping Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a popular fictional pairing. From romantic stories like ‘[WeiZhao] The Joy of Our Youthful Meeting’ to comedy pieces like ‘[WeiZhao] The Playboy Meets the dog’, these stories became fan favorites, bringing people into the fandom. And surprisingly, the couple’s “evidence” wasn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
For instance, fans had uncovered Tong Zhao’s main ‘Honor of Kings’ account. Though she wasn’t a VIP player, her account had all the skins available, meaning someone had been gifting them to her. And because her intimacy level was visible to other players, it wasn’t hard for fans to connect her with Wei Zekai, whose account appeared as her top “friend,” showering her with gifts.
 

 
The two hadn’t officially announced anything, and their in-game relationship was just a blue “buddy” connection. Plus, Wei Zekai had a high intimacy score with many friends, indicating that he simply enjoyed sending gifts to everyone in his circle.
 

 
Netizens quickly uncovered that Wei’s account constantly had tens of thousands of in-game currency, which he spent generously on each new skin release, even gifting friends who didn’t actively play. Tong Zhao once commented, “It’s normal for him. Back in elementary school, he’d always buy tons of Little Raccoon noodles and hand out the collectible cards to classmates.”
 

 
It was just a sign of his generosity, not necessarily any exclusive affection.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao even had a chance to clarify, however, the group of second-generation rich friends from Wei Zekai’s circle in ZeShan Capital had already gotten a bit anxious over the gossip.
 

 
All the friends popped up in unison, quickly distancing themselves and humorously encouraging Wei Zekai to "untie himself" from any love rumors.
 

 
The first two who spoke up on Weibo were relatively subtle:
 

 
@SecondGen_A:
 
“The only single scent around here is coming from Wei Zekai. Don’t drag him into the mess of romance.”
 

 
@SecondGen_B:
 
“Pure, innocent brotherhood—can’t say it’ll stay that way, though! /dog face”
 

 
Then, things quickly took a humorous turn:
 

 
@SecondGen_C:
 
“With my brother Zekai’s emotional intelligence, getting married at 30 would still be ‘early dating’ for him!”
 

 
…
 

 
@SecondGen_E:
 
“Pick me instead! Aren’t I and Zhao Zhao legit? [Photo.JPG]”
 

 
This was a soft, sweet girl from the south with family wealth, just a notch below Wei Zekai’s in ZeShan Ventures. Her close photo with Tong Zhao set off a playful competition, with everyone, half-serious, half-joking, claiming Tong Zhao as “the best sister ever.”
 

 
Seeing the fuss, Wei Zekai couldn’t stay silent. With a strong sense of caution, he checked with Tong Zhao first to avoid saying anything that might trouble her. His thoughtfulness impressed her—he’d clearly grown a lot since his early days running ZeShan Ventures, where his emotional
 
intelligence was low, and he acted impulsively with little regard for others.
 

 
In their past life, Wei Zekai’s bluntness and Tong Zhao’s stubbornness had led to a falling-out so severe that they became estranged.
 

 
But this time, Tong Zhao smiled warmly and replied, “Hold on. You’re my trump card.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was both shocked and flattered. “Am I that important?”
 

 
“Of course.”
 

 
With all the cards in her hand, Tong Zhao controlled the game.
 

 
---
 

 
In the entertainment news, Tong Zhao took center stage, covering half the headlines. In the financial news, ZeShan Ventures was the undisputed leader.
 

 
This venture capital firm, which gained attention after investing in ‘Little Lamb Gaming’, had seen incredible profits lately. Every company they backed had turned profitable, creating groundbreaking returns, especially over the past six months, with ZeShan Ventures appearing at the forefront of the highest-return projects.
 

 
Industry insiders were baffled—could this company predict the future?
 

 
But it wasn’t just about providing funds. According to CEOs of invested companies, ZeShan’s representatives offered crucial guidance, helping them assess risks and refine their projects. Their advice was like turning stone to gold. These investors weren’t just seen as angels; they were practically revered.
 

 
And with reverence came respect—and a hint of awe.
 

 
Imagine that—a powerhouse like ZeShan Ventures guiding numerous companies to profitable outcomes naturally has ways to deal with anyone who tries to step out of line. Realizing this, the smaller companies in ZeShan's network dared not act out; instead, they obediently looked to ZeShan as the market compass, heeding their guidance on everything.
 

 
After all, they hadn’t finished raking in the profits yet.
 

 
As ZeShan's investors took the lion’s share of the profits, these partner companies also benefitted significantly, savoring the leftovers. And apart from a few key suggestions, ZeShan didn’t micromanage their operations, creating a sense of comfortable, cooperative, win-win relationships.
 

 
Several financial publications sought interviews with ZeShan’s mastermind, but every request was declined. Finally, Wei Zekai stepped in as the public face. Raised with all the privileges, he wore his suit with a natural authority and a hint of a “king of the boardroom” air—no trace of the inexperience typical of his age group. It was clear that the money the Wei family had poured into his development wasn’t wasted; his broad perspective and steady nerves were unmistakable.
 

 
A closer look at the interview content revealed that Wei Zekai was not a mere figurehead. He demonstrated full knowledge of all ZeShan’s investment projects, familiar with every detail. Yet, despite his expertise, most people still couldn’t believe he was the one providing all the critical advice and insights. His strategies seemed too forward-thinking for one so young.
 

 
Of course, both Wei Zekai and everyone at ZeShan Ventures were unanimous in maintaining that they were only executors; the real strategist behind the scenes was someone else.
 

 
Many established companies, curious about this “mastermind,” privately contacted Wei Zekai in hopes of getting in touch with this expert. But they got nowhere—any attempts were met with vague replies that this person was “too busy.”
 

 
Rumors spread, with some speculating that Wei’s conglomerate was guiding him. As industry chatter grew, ZeShan Ventures scored another major success in its latest venture. In response, China’s most respected financial magazine, ‘WeatherVane’, reached out, offering a feature story on the main cover. They were eager to uncover more exclusive information, particularly about the true identity of ZeShan’s mysterious strategist. Even an online interview would suffice if the person preferred to remain anonymous.
 

 
In the business world, idols aren’t movie stars but financial guides, those with the foresight to steer markets to profit. Whoever can make big money is, temporarily, a deity.
 

 
Surprisingly, ZeShan Ventures accepted WeatherVane's invitation.
 

 
Industry peers were quick to make snide remarks, saying the elusive mastermind wasn’t “impossible” to interview; it just took the right magazine with enough clout.
 

 
Criticism aside, anticipation was high.
 

 
Every issue of ‘WeatherVane’ attracted suit-clad professionals in convenience stores and upscale coffee shops, grabbing a copy. Typically, trendy young people weren’t interested. But with this issue, a strange phenomenon occurred.
 

 
Regardless of age or gender, people stopped when they passed the issue of ‘WeatherVane’… then stared at it, puzzled.
 

 
The background of the cover is pure black, with a high-backed leather office chair at the center. Tong Zhao is seated in the chair, her hands relaxed on the armrests. She is wearing a white custom-tailored women's suit that perfectly outlines her graceful figure. Her slightly amber eyes, faintly visible beneath her light-colored pupils, reveal a confident smile at the corners of her lips, giving off an air of someone in full control.
 

 
Since rising to fame, Tong Zhao has been a regular in major fashion magazines.
 

 
She is capable of mastering various shooting styles, which is neither uncommon nor surprising.
 

 
But can someone explain why she is on the cover of ‘WV’???
 

 
The two lines of subheadings at the bottom of the magazine gave the public an answer:
 

 
“ZeShan Investments true leader — Tong Zhao”
 

 
“New Generation Investment Trendsetter”
 

 
…
 

 
Huh?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
The direct consequence of the confusion was that even people who were not interested in finance or economics casually bought a copy, leaving many white-collar workers who were waiting for the ‘ZeShan’ interview speechless — ‘WV’ had always sold well, but not to this extent. Many had planned to buy it during their lunch break, only to find it sold out!
 

 
The news of Tong Zhao appearing on the cover of ‘WV’ quickly spread across Weibo.
 

 
Many fans who had no idea about this magazine thought it was some obscure fashion publication that somehow managed to feature their idol, Tong Zhao. They felt it was necessary to boost sales to support the magazine. Tong Zhao’s fans didn’t engage in bulk buying or mass purchases, but with so many of them, even fans of her ex-boyfriend Han Zhi would purchase a copy to show their support.
 

 
‘WeatherVane’, a reputable and serious financial magazine, was completely sold out in both physical and online stores within a single day, thanks to the combined efforts of curious passersby, fans, white-collar workers, and stock market enthusiasts.
 

 
After the truth came out, WV's regular readership began complaining about the "fandom frenzy."
 

 
However, the “fandom girls” were innocent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fan club and the official channels didn’t promote bulk buying or collect money for sales. They were used to buying just one copy for personal use, and maybe another as a collectible. They hadn’t even gotten involved in the buying spree! Many of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t even get a copy!
 

 
As a result, a debate started under WV’s official Weibo account.
 

 
[Can we be reasonable? It’s clearly because the official side didn’t anticipate the sales, which led to the stock running out. We didn’t buy that many.]
 

 
[Is WV prohibiting new readers from buying? If so, could the official account make a statement, please?]
 

 
After some “friendly” exchanges, the original readers realized it was just a mix-up and started blaming the official account. Fortunately, WV’s official Weibo responded quickly, issuing an apology and announcing that they would immediately print more copies to meet the demand, while also welcoming new readers to learn more about financial knowledge.
 

 
Some bystanders felt sorry for WV, while others in the industry commented:
 

 
[Why feel sorry for WV? With this kind of sales, the editor-in-chief is probably laughing so much their mouth is going to tear.]
 

 
This statement is quite accurate.
 

 
Just bringing in the mysterious backer of ZeShan Investments was already a huge draw, but then it turns out that the person is Tong Zhao? It’s like hitting the jackpot—two yolks in one egg, a pie falling from the sky, and inside the pie is a gold ingot. They've made a huge profit.
 

 
However, the editor-in-chief still underestimated Tong Zhao’s ability to drive sales and her popularity.
 

 
Although the new magazine couldn’t meet everyone’s demand for copies right away, the content was quickly scanned and uploaded, allowing curious readers to get a sneak peek.
# Chapter94
This issue of WV featured a very special profile.
 

 
It started by listing a long string of investment projects in great detail.
 

 
Industry professionals with some research background, or investors with a keen sense of smell, were all surprised to find that these were all high-profit projects from this year, including some that were originally not well-regarded but later made a dramatic rise. Several stocks performed surprisingly well after receiving investment, even managing to overtake competitors after a sudden boost...
 

 
All of these were projects that ZeShan Venture Capital had participated in, ranked by the depth of their involvement.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, not a single one had lost money.
 

 
In less than a year, ZeShan Venture Capital had already accumulated a staggering profit return.
 

 
[For a young investment firm, this is almost an impossible feat. Anyone who works in investment knows that the basic process involves thorough selection, review, and project evaluation. Only after this is a project deemed to have potential for profit is investment made. Even with the most careful evaluations, no matter how reliable a project appears, it still has the possibility of significant losses.]
 

 
[An investment firm's profits typically come from the profitable projects that offset the losses from the unsuccessful ones. As long as the gains exceed the losses, an overall profit is achieved.]
 

 
[Today, we have invited the star investor behind this venture capital firm for an exclusive interview.]
 

 
[However, what the author didn’t expect was that their true identity would be...]
 

 
Behind the four lines of white text, there was an elegant backshot.
 

 
The tailored suit made her shoulders sharp and strong, while her long hair cascaded down her back—during the photo shoot, Tong Zhao had rejected the stylist’s suggestion to tie her hair into a neat bun or adopt a more professional hairstyle. Why should the media erase feminine traits when talking about successful women? Why should she present herself as a gender-neutral elite to be considered professional?
 

 
Tong Zhao never thought this way.
 

 
Of course, when her identity was that of an investor, Tong Zhao didn’t deliberately emphasize her feminine charm.
 

 
What she showed was her most authentic side, yet still keeping a sense of distance.
 

 
The woman in that backshot had an enviable body figure, but complementing that was the shining record described in those lines of text. WV had many middle-aged male readers, whose interests were more about profit than vanity. They completely overlooked her figure, instead being deeply attracted by her achievements in the investment world.
 

 
How did she do it?
 

 
Did Tong Zhao have an investment column in WV?
 

 
Please, master, enlighten us!
 

 
This was the voice of some readers.
 

 
“When I saw Miss Tong for the first time, I knew this interview would cause a huge stir.”
 

 
Upon hearing the journalist’s question, Tong Zhao smiled. “I’ve been thinking about when to reveal this identity,” she paused and then added, “Actually, I didn’t deliberately hide it. It’s just that my main job is too busy, and all the public-facing tasks were handled by Zekai and the others. They also wanted to protect me as much as possible... It’s a lovely misunderstanding. Plus, since it has nothing to do with my acting career, revealing it just hasn’t made it to the agenda.”
 

 
When the topic turned to ZeShan Venture Capital's members, a warm expression appeared on Tong Zhao’s otherwise distant face.
 

 
“Mr. Wei Zekai has said before that founding ZeShan Venture Capital was your idea—was that true?”
 

 
Tong Zhao openly admitted this and briefly described how ZeShan was established. It sounded almost unbelievable that this highly profitable investment firm had been set up in such an informal and almost playful manner. There was even a hint of making it up as they went along: “The high efficiency of ZeShan in generating funds is directly related to the fact that it’s a one-man show. In the beginning, I had absolute decision-making power, but now that Zekai has matured a lot, I’ve entrusted him with many of the detailed decisions.”
 

 
“What made you choose to enter two completely unrelated industries? Was there any particular opportunity? Many people speculate that it’s because you come from a business family.” The last question, which touched on a sensitive topic, had been cleared with Tong Zhao beforehand.
 

 
She indeed needed a chance to clarify.
 

 
Tong Zhao would rather toss money around casually than gild the lily.
 

 
“Both film and investment require a good eye, and fortunately, I have that.”
 

 
“As for the opportunity? It has nothing to do with my family background. My father always believed that his daughter couldn’t take over the family business. My interest in business came partly from passion, and partly because...” At this point, Tong Zhao's lips curved into a joyful smile, and she continued, “Most of my friends have had some experience with business failures, so I thought I’d give it a try myself.”
 

 
The reporter then asked several questions regarding Tong Zhao’s views on investment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not hold back, but instead used her own successful experiences to explain things in a straightforward yet deep way.
 

 
Even readers with no understanding of finance or economics would not see Tong Zhao as just a figurehead in her company after reading her eloquent responses. Although there was a hint of hindsight in her words, she had succeeded many times—surely it couldn’t all be luck! Wouldn’t listening to a successful person be more insightful than reading some theoretical column?
 

 
The journalist quickly recorded what Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Since WV was a finance magazine, there were many questions that new readers might be curious about, but which the journalist couldn’t ask. However, the journalist still hoped to gain a little gossip for the readers...
 

 
When asked about her installment purchase of the Long Xuan property, Tong Zhao smiled lightly:
 

 
“Buying in installments was simply because I didn’t want it to tie up too much of my capital.”
 

 
“And as for the contributions from ZeShan members? They all sent me a lot of furniture to celebrate my housewarming. When I get a chance, I’ll share some pictures of my new home on Weibo.”
 

 
The interview concluded with a brief introduction of the value of the property Tong Zhao had purchased.
 

 
The final photo was taken in Tong Zhao's study.
 

 
Wearing frameless glasses, she hid the sparkle in her almond-shaped eyes, giving off a temperament that was both restrained and intellectual.
 

 
After the public uproar had died down a bit, Xu Zhu had been subtly flaunting her blissful, pre-marriage life on her personal Weibo. She received all of Tong Zhenming’s love and seemed to live like a princess in a fairytale, about to marry into a "rich family." As for the struggles behind closed doors, netizens knew nothing about it. Even if she had to swallow her bitterness in silence, she would never let Tong Zhao know that she wasn’t living well.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who lived alone in a spacious penthouse, had graced the cover of a well-known finance magazine, appearing like an all-powerful queen.
 

 
……
 

 
This scanned version of the interview allowed many netizens to finally read the content they were curious about.
 

 
While most netizens didn’t find anything unusual, Tong Zhao’s fans became anxious and spontaneously organized campaigns to promote subscriptions to WeatherVane's official digital version, which was reasonably priced. Of course, there were still those who had no qualms about reading pirated versions, but many fans, after being reminded, went ahead and purchased the high-definition digital versions, which resulted in a significant increase in the magazine’s online sales.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were very copyright-conscious.
 

 
Unintentionally, this left a good impression on many businesses.
 

 
Although there was this minor pirated content issue, the fact that Tong Zhao appeared on the cover of WeatherVane still successfully shook the entire internet...
 

 
Even those who never cared about the entertainment industry or didn’t watch blockbuster movies were now aware of this big news!
 

 
What?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s side business is investing? She made a lot of money?
 

 
That’s not surprising...
 

 
Don’t celebrities usually make a lot of money?
 

 
Wait, the apps I use daily like Xiao Yang Companion, Huanhui Video, Meitu Master, etc., were all funded by ZeShan Venture Capital? Ordinary people, who thought investment had nothing to do with them, were amazed and fascinated by the fact that “I’m actually using projects that Tong Zhao invested in,” and were eager to learn more.
 

 
They suddenly felt more involved, like they were the seed in this big fruit.
 

 
The more they learned, the more they discovered a new side of Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so impressive…]
 

 
[I always thought ZeShan sounded familiar—didn’t my dad always talk about this genius investment firm?]
 

 
[Wow, many of these projects have the potential to go public. Sister Zhao is amazing!]
 

 
[Before working with Tong Zhao, Young Master Wei seemed to be losing money a lot. Looks like it’s really Sister Zhao who helped him turn things around.]
 

 
[Got it. I used to think she was just marrying into wealth, but now I realize the rich guy is the one holding on to her.]
 

 
[All I want to know is, does the scumbag dad regret it? He let go of the golden leg.]
 

 
Speaking of the scumbag dad, netizens remembered the issue about full payments and loans for buying houses, which was mentioned earlier by Bala Media.
 

 
Intrigued, netizens dug a little deeper and found another juicy tidbit.
 

 
@EntertainmentExposer:
 

 
Netizens discovered that the down payment for the Long Xuan A1 unit was enough to buy two of Xu Zhu’s pre-marriage homes outright. /laughing/ /laughing/
 

 
They even included photos.
 

 
Although the photos were of the same unit type, the differences between the two were immediately apparent. Given the high attention around this tidbit, some interested parties analyzed the scale and estimated profits of Tong Zhenming’s company, concluding that: [Even if the scumbag dad sold his blood, he wouldn’t be able to buy the Long Xuan A1 unit outright. Paying in installments would be just as difficult.]
 

 
Now, no one felt sorry for Tong Zhao anymore.
 

 
Instead, people found her family of clowns laughable.
 

 
Many children who had been mistreated by their birth families could relate to Tong Zhao and felt the same satisfaction as reading a "feel-good" story.
 

 
[Every time Tong Zhao steps out of her circle, she does so in such a unique way…]
 

 
[Shocking the whole company.]
 

 
[Upstairs 1, not gonna lie, my boss, who’s obsessed with stock trading, has already started worshiping her as the Goddess of Wealth.]
 

 
If this wasn’t enough of a reality check, then the WeChat conversation records that Wei Zekai shared further confirmed that Tong Zhao was indeed the true decision-maker behind ZeShan Venture Capital.
 

 
@Wei Zekai v:
 

 
Some content that’s no longer considered commercial secrets.
 

 
Just consider it a fan benefit, hoping more people can get to know her other side.
 

 
The nine-grid chat screenshots were taken from the ZeShan management group, showing Tong Zhao making decisions and giving directions. From the founding of ZeShan to their latest investments, these screenshots proved that each project bore Tong Zhao’s stamp of approval.
 

 
Some comments even teased about their relationship, asking what the connection was between them.
 

 
Wei Zekai personally replied to one such comment: [We're partners and super good friends.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai might not know, but answering like that makes the ship even more shippable.]
 

 
[Don’t ask, just know they’re partners.]
 

 
[Got it, it’s real!]
 

 
……
 

 
With nothing else to do, Wei Zekai had to retreat offline and play dead.
 

 
At this point, the big gossip had reached a resolution.
 

 
Later, ZeShan's second-generation rich members posted on Weibo about the housewarming gifts they gave to Tong Zhao—expensive furniture and useful gadgets. Wei Zekai had given her an Italian Baxter sofa, which cost at least a million yuan if imported, a full set of Gaggenau kitchen appliances, and high-end audio and video equipment... He had put a lot of thought into the gift, since future private meetings would likely be held at her home.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a new movie coming out, and of course, she would need a place to watch it.
 

 
Her home was the perfect gathering spot.
 

 
Moreover, all the second-generation rich had made a lot of money through ZeShan, so they didn’t have to worry about their family’s disapproval. Some even saw their status at home rise because of their connection to ZeShan... Everyone wanted a piece of the pie and asked Tong Zhao what projects she was currently interested in.
 

 
They knew they’d have a chance to enjoy the benefits together, so the gifts were particularly lavish.
 

 
The gossip still had some lingering buzz as netizens discovered...
 

 
If we’re talking about being favored, then Tong Zhao was indeed adored by the rich young heirs!
 

 
However, calling her a little princess seemed a bit beneath her.
 

 
At the very least, she was at the queen level.
 

 
The agent and the company closely monitored the big data and found that Tong Zhao's popularity and public favorability had significantly increased, and her fanbase had seen another breakthrough. However, the number of male fans had slightly declined—some male users seemed unable to accept her strong ability to run a company. This was a strange phenomenon because, in the past, there had been female stars who were famous for their high fees, but this kind of "unfollowing" phenomenon never occurred before...
 

 
The final analysis suggested that when female stars become wealthy because of their beauty, acting skills, and sex appeal, it doesn't trigger the insecurity and resentment of male fans. However, when a female star achieves remarkable success in what they perceive as a male-dominated field, they cannot accept it.
 

 
"It doesn't matter,"
 

 
Sister Chu scoffed, bringing this PR matter to a close. She then turned to ask her assistant, "Would you consider this as ‘purifying’ Tong Zhao's fanbase?"
 

 
"Purifying" a fanbase usually refers to turning group fans (such as those who follow a group or a couple) into solo fans (or "only fans")—often involving marketing strategies and tactics that disappoint group fans, making them feel sympathy for the idol and thereby making the fanbase more loyal to the individual member.
 

 
Tong Zhao's "purification"?
 

 
It was more like driving away the low-minded individuals who couldn't stand seeing a female celebrity succeed in business.
 

 
"I don't think so," the assistant hesitated.
 

 
"Ultimately, it's a good thing—it reduces the harassment from color-based hate messages," Sister Chu concluded.
 

 
With the storm subsiding, Tong Zhao was granted a week off to rest. During this time, she handled some business affairs for ZeShan Venture Capital. The agent believed that Tong Zhao's exposure in the first half of the year was sufficient, and her position in the industry was now almost unshakeable. Her momentum was at its peak. With the highly anticipated film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ waiting to be released, she no longer needed to shoot variety shows and dramas back to back as she had before.
 

 
Her status was solidified, so now it was time to cultivate a higher profile.
 

 
After waiting, the film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was finally edited and began its promotional phase.
 

 
Tong Zhao had gained experience in promotional events, and there was nothing special about this round of marketing—just the same old routine. The only downside was that her brief but enjoyable holiday was coming to an end, as ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was a big-budget production, meaning the promotional tour would likely require a nationwide run.
 

 
Then came a phone call from Sister Chu, her tone subtle and somewhat complicated, as if something unbelievable had happened:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, did you agree to a ‘friendly sparring’ with Jiang Dang...?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the sofa eating watermelon with a friend, had her hand slip and the watermelon fell to the floor.
# Chapter95
After asking more questions, Tong Zhao finally understood the whole situation.
 

 
Let’s rewind the timeline to a day earlier.
 

 
Normally, when it comes to movie promotions, the actor’s agent will coordinate the schedule — deciding what to do and where to go at specific times. A series of arrangements must be made in advance, and some smaller stars might use this massive exposure opportunity to secure some individual bookings.
 

 
Both Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao had long passed this stage.
 

 
After the completion ceremony, when the draft of the promotional announcement was being prepared, the company asked if the artist had any thoughts or suggestions. Tong Zhao was only interested in making the movie. Once the film was completed, it was like an author filling in a plot hole — the project became just another finished task. She had feelings about the project, of course, but anything further was just business. So, she nonchalantly handed everything over to her agent.
 

 
This made Sister Chu both happy and a little regretful.
 

 
She was happy because Tong Zhao trusted her so much, but she was regretful because Tong Zhao didn’t have much interest in the promotion.
 

 
On the other hand, Jiang Dang took the promotional campaign very seriously and made suggestions.
 

 
This caused Jiang Dang’s agent, Aaron, to feel his heart leap to his throat.
 

 
When Jiang Dang proposed a live-streamed free-fight match with Tong Zhao, Aaron’s heart sank even further.
 

 
It felt like it had dropped to the floor.
 

 
“Bro, are you serious?” Aaron’s attitude dramatically shifted. “Have you regained your character’s memory? Didn’t we fight enough in the movie?”
 

 
Of course, as one of the few who had seen the original cut of the movie, Aaron knew the underlying meaning of this question — ‘Didn’t you already get enough of a beating in the film?’ Jiang Dang turned around and gave him a look full of unspoken emotion, his tone soft and lingering, “In the movie, the action designer was in control, so it wasn’t really me fighting; it was a stunt double, no esports spirit there.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wasn’t that obvious?
 

 
Without the stunt coordinator enhancing your moves, without the action designer manipulating you, you’d have been knocked out by Tong Zhao in an instant — and what would be left to act?
 

 
And what’s with the "esports spirit"?
 

 
Aaron tried his best to hold back, but finally couldn’t take it anymore:
 

 
“Aren’t you just good at playing Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan? What does esports spirit have to do with you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan has professional leagues, you know.”
 

 
His voice was magnetic and alluring, but when he spoke casually, there was often an inexplicable tone, as if he were intentionally acting cute. Aaron, being another man, didn’t get the appeal and found it a bit cringy, but Jiang Dang remained oblivious, still using his beautiful voice, which had conquered the entire new generation of Chinese-language pop music, to act cute: “She agreed to fight me. If you don’t believe me, ask her.”
 

 
His tone was almost one of mock indignation.
 

 
The rejection from the agent spun around in Jiang Dang's vast mind like an endless universe. He didn’t know what kind of scenario he had imagined, but the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. His emotions were written all over his handsome face, the deep, perfect lines of his features tightening slightly. His mischievous and noble aura made him seem like a demon lord from a fantasy film, whose mere glance could cause heads to roll…
 

 
Jiang Dang pulled out his phone, his long, distinct fingers slowly typing out a message…
 

 
“What are you writing?”
 

 
The agent leaned over to take a look. It was the page for posting on his official Weibo account.
 

 
[Want, to, fight, a, woman…]
 

 
The agent quickly snatched the phone away, his temples throbbing. He realized this guy had somehow cracked the password to his official Weibo account… Yes, while others tend to talk too much, Jiang Dang was someone who would mess up after saying just one sentence. So, in order to better manage his public image and avoid being misunderstood because of his unusual way of expressing himself (the phrase “want to fight a woman” actually didn’t imply any hatred towards women, it was just a random emotional outburst he had when thinking about sparring with Tong Zhao), the agent had worked hard to keep Jiang Dang’s Weibo secure.
 

 
But honestly, this guy had such low emotional intelligence, how did he manage to be so skillful in weird areas?
 

 
Not only was he a semi-professional player of Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan (a mobile game), but he had also been a hacker.
 

 
Jiang Dang had once explained it to him with an air of mystery.
 

 
— Because in the world of 0s and 1s, there aren't as many twists and turns. It’s much easier to understand than the world of ordinary people.
 

 
The agent didn’t understand C language.
 

 
All he got from Jiang Dang’s statement was that it sounded like some bizarre philosophical rambling.
 

 
“You post this kind of content, people will think you’re a misogynist,” the agent said, trying to suppress his urge to pinch his ear. “Even if you're talking about something else, this kind of statement should never come from a public figure. It can lead to misunderstandings.”
 

 
After five minutes of lecturing, Jiang Dang finally admitted that he now understood the inappropriateness of what he had written.
 

 
He may have low emotional intelligence, but he didn’t want to encourage others to hurt women, or have his female fans go around hurting men to please him... That thought was horrifying, so he needed to be careful with his words. After getting his phone back, he sincerely apologized, “Thanks for the reminder.”
 

 
The apology was very sincere.
 

 
One could feel that he was genuinely sorry.
 

 
The agent breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
Sigh, Jiang Dang was a little insane, but he wasn’t a bad person.
 

 
Just as the agent was feeling some relief, he saw that Jiang Dang had deleted the original text and replaced it with something new:
 

 
[Want, to, be, hit, by, a, woman…]
 

 
…
 

 
The agent nearly choked on his breath, almost unable to catch it.
 

 
Jiang Dang, with his innocent look on his face, looked so good that it was infuriating.
 

 
After spending so much time with him, the agent had come to understand his thoughts. Saying he wanted to “fight a woman” might encourage fans to do something bad, but saying he wanted to “be hit by a woman” should be fine, right? Little genius! The agent sternly prepared to lecture him, but when Jiang Dang looked at him with those long eyelashes and delicate phoenix eyes, the agent’s heart skipped a beat, and he found himself changing his words, “Fine, Brother Dang, I was wrong. I’ll arrange it for you, just don’t mess with me anymore, my heart can’t handle it.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Yay!”
 

 
…
 

 
Agent: “Yay my ass!”
 

 
…
 

 
After quietly listening to Sister Chu explain the situation to her, Tong Zhao came to a conclusion: “So, the publicity team has decided to have me and Jiang Dang do a live-streamed free-fight match, right?”
 

 
"Yes..."
 

 
Sister Chu’s voice was tinged with helplessness. "Do you want me to reject it for you?"
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly. "No need. I did promise him, so if we’re fighting, then let’s fight."
 

 
After all, she wasn’t going to lose.
 

 
"Actually, it sounds kind of interesting. What do you think Jiang Dang has in his head?"
 

 
Sister Chu was stumped.
 

 
It was probably a question that no one in the entire entertainment industry could answer.
 

 
But because no one knew the real answer, Jiang Dang’s devoted fans were very eager to give him all sorts of strange personas, as if he were an oddly beautiful egg, with poets daydreaming that inside the egg was an entire universe.
 

 
The two shifted the topic and discussed other schedule arrangements.
 

 
"Alright, I understand. No problem."
 

 
After finishing the call, Tong Zhao looked up and met the curious eyes that were trying hard to control their curiosity.
 

 
With money, even ghosts can grind the mill. Tong Zhao’s house was renovated at an unbelievably fast pace, and at the same time, it became the headquarters for ZeShan Venture Capital. Contrary to some malicious speculation about how lonely a single woman must be living in a large apartment, her friends were more than happy to stay at her place and hang out every day—it was luxurious and comfortable. The agent hired cleaning staff and a chef through reliable channels to live with her and take care of her meals and any catering needs for guests.
 

 
For example, when her friends came over, they could have fresh fried chicken, fries, and popcorn made right on the spot.
 

 
Sometimes, when Tong Zhao was on work calls, her fearless friends would quietly wait for her to finish, knowing the drill.
 

 
One of the second-generation rich kids couldn’t hold back any longer. "What do you mean by 'fight'? Is it a game?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
Tong Zhao explained the entire situation from start to finish, then commented, "He’s a strange person, but not unpleasant. He seems to be the type who follows his own temperament… a creative singer, an artistic person with a certain nature. He’s interesting to talk to, always able to surprise people. He’s quite fun."
 

 
When following his nature to the extreme, it could turn into selfishness.
 

 
Building his own satisfaction on the suffering of others.
 

 
Jiang Dang managed to control this balance very well. It seemed that, in addition to having a broad mind, he also had decent upbringing. During their multiple collaborations on ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Tong Zhao’s impressions of him were generally good, and she could feel his intense desire to compete in the film. She figured it was fine to indulge him a little.
 

 
"Besides, this angle creates a lot of buzz and has a positive impact on the movie’s promotion."
 

 
After she finished speaking, she hummed and laughed. "Seems like compared to him, I’m actually quite pragmatic."
 

 
After discussing Jiang Dang for a while, the group shifted their focus and headed to the game room to play multiplayer video games.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned back on the sofa and said she would go over later.
 

 
Wei Zekai stayed behind to keep her company.
 

 
"Come on, speak up."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow. "Speak about what?"
 

 
"You've got a lot on your mind, it’s almost written on your face. And you’re asking me what to say?"
 

 
Tong Zhao reached out and pinched his face.
 

 
It was a shame. When he was younger, his chubby cheeks were fun to pinch, but now his face had slimmed down so much that there wasn’t much flesh to grab. Though his sharp, well-defined features were more pronounced, the fun of pinching his little chubby cheeks was gone. Tong Zhao pinched his face while voicing her thoughts, but Wei Zekai disagreed.
 

 
"I'm not skinny, alright? I’ve got plenty of muscle."
 

 
"Where?"
 

 
Wei Zekai lifted his shirt, revealing a perfectly sculpted set of abs.
 

 
With just a little tension, the tattoo on his side near his obliques became visible as his muscles tightened.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick glance, her voice flat as she deadpanned, "Mmm, so impressive. So sexy."
 

 
Wei Zekai saw right through her indifference. "Can you at least pretend to be surprised?"
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I can’t help it. Lately, I’ve been shooting photos in the studio, and, well... there are male models everywhere, shirtless, and they look good too."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Three giant exclamation marks seemed to practically leap out of Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
He was upset. Very upset.
 

 
"They look better than me?"
 

 
Not really.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s looks could easily get him into the entertainment industry. His features were refined enough to be on a whole different level.
 

 
But they were all good-looking guys, and to get better shooting results, they would all work on their muscles before going on set (muscles look especially good after a workout, so it’s a thing among straight guys who take selfies at the gym), some even applied oil to enhance the visual effect…
 

 
Tong Zhao caught the defeat in her friend’s tone and quickly changed the subject, "Why compare yourself to models? You’re the best-looking."
 

 
Although Wei Zekai was prone to irritation, he was also easy to calm down.
 

 
When Tong Zhao said he was the best-looking, he believed her.
 

 
Within two sentences, he dropped the subject and said, "By the way, Jiang Dang wants to fight you... how come you agreed to it? I haven’t even had a chance to fight you yet."
 

 
Aha, now he was really getting into it.
 

 
Tong Zhao grabbed a handful of milk candies from the coffee table and handed them to him. "Have some candy to keep that mouth of yours shut. Are you asking to get beaten?"
 

 
"I just feel like others have done things with you, but I haven’t, and it’s a bit annoying."
 

 
And if you did...?
 

 
Tong Zhao slowed down her thoughts, which had been racing at seventy miles per hour.
# Chapter96
After all, martial arts values peace and harmony, and one must uphold martial ethics, not engage in internal struggles.
 

 
Although he had bruises in three places, Wei Zekai was still in high spirits and went to play games with the other friends. This left Tong Zhao feeling puzzled. After two lifetimes, she didn’t know that Wei Zekai was actually a bit of a masochist? However, emotionally, it made sense. He probably felt that only close friends could have that kind of playful interaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a short nap on the sofa.
 

 
What she didn’t know was that Wei Zekai had gone to boast to the other friends.
 

 
Second-generation C: "Did you fight back?"
 

 
"Of course!"
 

 
Wei Zekai took the game controller: "I wasn’t trying to get beaten up. It was just a friendly spar!"
 

 
"Did you really fight back? Your brain doesn’t work that well, you didn’t hurt our Sister Zhao, right?" Hearing this, second-generation A asked nervously, looking as though he wanted to punch Wei Zekai himself. Some of them had noticed that his relationship with Sister Zhao was different, and they silently thought, is this how you create time for them to be alone? How reassuring...
 

 
"I did fight back, but I didn’t win. She's really good."
 

 
At this point, Wei Zekai's thin lips curled into a slightly smug smile, his face clearly in a good mood.
 

 
No one really understood what he was so proud of, but everyone agreed that Tong Zhao was amazing. This chapter of events was easily closed for everyone.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, she managed to get a good sleep right at the end of the holiday.
 

 
Since becoming famous, she had been under constant scrutiny. For safety and image reasons, she inevitably distanced herself from the crowd. As Kafka said, a person who lives in solitude needs a window facing an alley, so the sounds of her friends joking around in the game room served as the best white noise, lulling her into a deep, safe, and peaceful sleep.
 

 
Aside from that, she asked for nothing more.
 

 
...
 

 
The holiday ended, and after two promotional events, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ began its nationwide tour, which was almost as intense as a nationwide performance tour. The schedule was very packed, testing the physical stamina of all the roadshow staff. The only time they could rest was while traveling by car or airplane, but could they really rest well in such a small space? Clearly, they could not. So, aside from putting on bright smiles when facing the audience, nearly everyone had the same exhausted expression.
 

 
Especially during some pre-screening events.
 

 
Because spoilers couldn’t be given, the topics of conversation with the audience were often irrelevant.
 

 
They could only talk about local food or scenic spots, and then end with a group photo.
 

 
But when it came to food and scenery...
 

 
There was simply no time to eat, drink, or play—there was no time to even sleep!
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Each time they went on tour, all the roadshow members were shocked by Tong Zhao’s incredible stamina and good appetite. Her food intake wasn't particularly large, but during the last event of the day, when the promotional activities might go on until midnight, by the time everyone returned to their accommodations, they were too tired to have any appetite. The staff would take a few bites of food and call it a meal, and the stars, in order to maintain their figures, ate even less—those few pieces of salad leaves were practically the same as not eating, and anything with too much oil or salt was impossible to stomach. Plus, they had to get up early for the next morning’s event.
 

 
But what was Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
After confirming there wouldn't be any emergencies, she would visit local snack streets and famous restaurants in every city. She would even bring back bags of snacks, many of which would be eaten by the staff during the ride.
 

 
So, since they couldn’t talk about the movie content or give spoilers during the pre-screening events, the conversation would often turn to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Where’s a good place nearby to visit?
 

 
What’s delicious to eat?
 

 
She was the only one who could keep the conversation going.
 

 
“There’s a really good pig’s stomach chicken restaurant nearby? Hmm, I’ve been there. What stood out to me the most was the bamboo fungus inside, it’s much longer than regular bamboo fungus. I personally recommend the Shunde fish skin dumplings.”
 

 
“I went there at midnight. We spent all day doing the roadshow, so some of the places were closed, but the snack street stays open really late.”
 

 
“I’ve been to the beach at dawn. The water quality is really good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao kept in mind that during the promotional period, she needed to increase her exposure and couldn’t stay too low-key. So, she happily took selfies whenever she went out and posted them on her Weibo in the same grid-style format. However, she only posted pictures from a city after leaving for the next one, which made it impossible for her enthusiastic fans to track her down. They had no choice but to obediently follow the roadshow.
 

 
Once the movie promotion period began, it was the happiest time for her fans.
 

 
[Today, I found another high-intensity 9-grid post!]
 

 
[More swimsuit pics! I don’t need this bit of traffic qwq]
 

 
[I saw something! It’s the hot pot grid from her 9-grid Weibo, I’m starving! Sister Zhao, where are you going next? Will you come to my hometown?]
 

 
The person saying this was a soft girl, and Tong Zhao happened to be scrolling through Weibo when she replied: [You didn’t even say where your hometown is, sis.]
 

 
Not only did she reply, but she also called her "sis," which made the female fan so excited she nearly fainted.
 

 
Tong Zhao's bold presence naturally triggered some criticism.
 

 
Like many celebrities with high traffic and hot topics, it’s impossible to be loved by everyone online; instead, there will always be discussions—along with true fans, there will be genuine haters. Love can come unexpectedly, and hate can be just as passionate.
 

 
So, what’s the angle this time?
 

 
It’s that Tong Zhao isn’t taking her work seriously, neglecting the roadshow to go off and have fun.
 

 
This criticism isn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
Netizens who don’t understand the roadshow process might think that it’s normal to eat and play a bit while traveling between cities. But anyone who understands the promotional tour for a movie would know that this is nearly impossible. There was an instance where more than 20 main creators were divided into three groups, traveling to nearly 100 cities across the country in 35 days, completing 500 promotional events. Just hearing the scale of that workload shows how tight the schedule is.
 

 
Of course, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t quite that extreme, but it wasn’t far off.
 

 
If the roadshow has strong feedback, the investors will increase funding.
 

 
So, there are movies where the main creative team’s effort in running roadshows leads to a successful turnaround.
 

 
If one or two photos are showing that they squeezed in a bit of time for leisure, it might be excusable. But to visit every city? It couldn’t be that the whole crew is waiting for her to have fun, could it?
 

 
Some netizens compiled Tong Zhao’s recent Weibo posts.
 

 
Sure enough, she posted photos of her enjoying herself in each city. During the roadshow, she still found time to visit shops. It seemed almost like a spiritual mystery.
 

 
Some haters seized on this point, criticizing her for being unprofessional.
 

 
After all, wasn’t it just recently that she used a month of seclusion to build her "dedicated" persona?
 

 
Fans who understood the process didn’t know how to defend her. They could only weakly reply: "The core duty of an actor is to deliver a good performance, and post-production promotion and pre-filming work shouldn’t be considered the same thing to criticize."
 

 
The haters triumphantly retorted: "Why isn’t it the same? Stars with more clout than her are still doing the roadshows properly. Why is it that when it comes to her, it’s a nationwide tour?"
 

 
Fans were infuriated!
 

 
But they couldn’t bear to tell Tong Zhao to stop playing and focus on the roadshow.
 

 
They could only mute the microphone and quietly repeat their anticipation for her new film to release.
 

 
This small public opinion storm did attract some attention from the industry. Since it was during the movie’s promotional period, the creative team naturally wouldn’t let any dirt be thrown on them without responding. Tong Zhao, who brought in attention with her presence, posted roadshow photos that garnered more attention, which benefited the movie. This minor controversy, if handled well, could serve as free promotion.
 

 
First, the official Weibo account of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ listed the roadshow schedule and stated that Tong Zhao had never been late or left early.
 

 
Then, they bought a marketing account to clarify from a third-party perspective.
 

 
@EntertainmentFrontline:
 

 
A netizen pointed out that in Tong Zhao’s “roadshow travel diary,” the photos were all taken late at night or in the early morning hours, without taking up work time. It seems that for the sake of fun, Sister Zhao really worked hard!
 

 
[Screenshot]
 

 
At first glance, the photos are indeed from unusual hours.
 

 
The popular shops Tong Zhao visited were mostly open until late at night.
 

 
There were also fan reports from roadshow attendees who mentioned that when Tong Zhao met with fans, she didn’t look tired or sleep-deprived at all. In fact, she appeared to be in great spirits, indicating that her balance of work and leisure was effective!
 

 
There were also on-site photos to support this.
 

 
When netizens saw them, they seemed to believe it was true.
 

 
Since it didn’t affect her work, aside from the extreme haters who needed to fabricate stories to criticize her, no one else was fixated on the issue anymore.
 

 
The main creators and Sister Chu worked together to clarify the situation, which led to a round of positive publicity.
 

 
Originally, the matter would have been forgotten.
 

 
But then Jiang Dang posted on Weibo.
 

 
@JiangDangv:
 

 
"I want Tong Zhao to take me for hotpot... She made me get up at 3 a.m..."
 

 
His agent changed his Weibo password, but he cracked it and regained control of his account once again.
 

 
It’s rare for him to use his main account, and Jiang Dang also enjoys internet fame.
 

 
[So, did you go?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: No, I couldn’t get up.
 

 
[Couldn’t you go by yourself?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: If I went by myself, my agent would tell me to bring a bodyguard. I didn’t want to trouble anyone to work overtime.
 

 
Why doesn’t he need a bodyguard if Tong Zhao goes with him???
 

 
Many netizens flooded the comment section with their doubts.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Go watch my new movie, and you’ll understand."
 

 
Wow, now he’s promoting his own movie—fans were so moved they nearly cried.
 

 
Of course, "actively responding" Jiang Dang lasted only one afternoon before his agent changed his password to something even more complicated, turning it into a battle of wits and making it all the more fun.
 

 
With this side explanation, netizens became more convinced that Tong Zhao wasn’t unprofessional; she just really can do it all.
 

 
The topic then shifted to how much sleep Tong Zhao actually gets in a day.
 

 
…
 

 
The photographer, following the roadshow, was exhausted and almost collapsed. When she saw Tong Zhao heading out, she originally planned to force herself to stay alert to take pictures, but Tong Zhao said it wasn’t necessary—she’d handle it herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao would place her camera, which had a timer function, casually on tree trunks or railings, acting as her own photographer. The photos she took turned out well enough, mainly because of the great material; no matter what angle she shot from, it looked good.
 

 
Her fans were calling for more swimsuit photos, which were actually quite casual.
 

 
In the photos, Tong Zhao wore loose beige pants and a black bikini top, her waist gracefully blending into the pants. In the distance, the dark blue waves, separated by rocky cliffs, met the brightly lit food street. Tong Zhao’s long hair flowed in the wind, the moonlight and stars reflected in her eyes, almost as if it were a beam of frozen light. It was so stunning, it could captivate anyone.
 

 
It was so beautiful.
 

 
The key wasn’t her slender figure, which looked like it had been shaped by hunger. Wearing the bikini, she confidently showed off her abdominal muscles, clearly a sign of well-developed core strength, but it didn’t detract from the overall beauty.
 

 
When talking about Tong Zhao and mentioning this star, it’s inevitable to think about her latest work.
 

 
Isn't it an action film?
 

 
Combining that with the movie she’s currently promoting...
 

 
If female stars work so hard on their physiques, how could the action scenes not be exciting?
 

 
Fans have already started asking those who attended the pre-screening roadshows, "Did Tong Zhao wear anything more revealing during her fight scenes in the movie?"
 

 
"Anyone seen the pre-screening of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’? How’s Tong Zhao’s fight scenes? Does she have chemistry with the male lead? Any predictions for the box office?"
 

 
[Male lead? No need for one, with Tong Zhao in the movie. She’s the only lead; the other guy is just the 'lead's boyfriend.']
 

 
[I feel like the chemistry with her boyfriend isn’t as strong as the one with Fu Xuancheng.]
 

 
[Fu Xuancheng played by Jiang Dang? Honestly, it’s pretty surprising that they invited him to play this role. I think his subconscious might be even more unstable than Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
The discussion got so heated that by the time they reached the 100th comment, the audience who had actually seen the film finally showed up with their reviews.
 

 
"Thanks for the invite, just got out of the screening. Director Shi really picked the right person for this challenge. For a modern martial arts film, it exceeded expectations. The pleasant surprise was that Tong Zhao actually suited this kind of comedy with a bit of a funny element? I originally thought her face would be too serious and not funny at all, but she was pretty interesting. The costumes, makeup, and set design were all top-notch. After the screening, the creators said that many of the weapons used were original designs and that they were considering renting them out to other productions after the film finishes. They really put a lot of effort into it."
 

 
"I'm just a casual fan of Jiang Dang, but he's so funny! I feel like only his subconscious could pull off that quirky, stubborn character. And the way he interacts with Tong Zhao... Ah, I can’t spoil it! Just go see it, one movie is all it takes to turn into a fan!"
 

 
"What’s going on with Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao? Don’t just leave it halfway like that."
 

 
"Basically, I’m shipping them now."
 

 
Spoilers couldn’t be stopped. Curious fans scrolled through to the highlighted spoilers and related Weibo posts, piecing together one thing:
 

 
Jiang Dang got beaten up.
 

 
So, what’s the deal with this beating?
 

 
Confusing, I don’t get it.
 

 
It wasn’t until the roadshow ended that a new promotional activity was launched:
 

 
"Tong Zhao accepts Jiang Dang’s challenge and will have an exclusive 1v1 live broadcast of free fighting on Eagle Vision Platform on [Month] [Day]!”
# Chapter97
1v1 Free Fighting?
 

 
Immediately, a ring appeared in the minds of the netizens.
 

 
On opposite sides of the ring stood Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, both striking ready boxing poses.
 

 
...
 

 
The scene was so vivid that the netizens felt a little dizzy.
 

 
Soon after, the official Weibo account released "promotional photos" of the two of them preparing for the fight. Tong Zhao, dressed in a sports vest, showed off her great figure, which netizens dubbed the "most natural" among female stars. Some curious users even compared her body to that of other female celebrities who debuted around the same time. While she might not be the thinnest, she was undoubtedly the most toned and fit.
 

 
[Forget female celebrities, even some young idols don't manage their bodies as well as she does.]
 

 
Some netizens shared screenshots from a swimming variety show, where several handsome young male celebrities had soft and untoned bodies. They weren’t fat, but the metabolism of young men was high, and even without much exercise, their legs were still notably slim.
 

 
It was clear they lacked exercise, which made them less appetizing to look at.
 

 
Even a little muscle tone could set one apart from their peers by a mile.
 

 
Fans, by contrast, often indulged and were too lazy to work out.
 

 
After all, as long as they wore clothes, looking good in the face was enough. If not, post-production could always help fix things.
 

 
[This girl who went out at 3 AM to eat hotpot could have that kind of body?]
 

 
[Got it, spicy food speeds up metabolism, so hotpot is a weight-loss food /dog head.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is truly a time management master!]
 

 
But what about the other photo?
 

 
What surprised netizens was that Jiang Dang's physique was actually quite good.
 

 
In the poster, he had a side profile, and the lighting accentuated his sharp and cold handsome features.
 

 
Jiang Dang's skin tone was pale, seemingly rarely exposed to sunlight.
 

 
After all, the filming for "Instinct" wouldn’t affect his real-life complexion. His hobby was staying home to play video games. Unexpectedly, he had many quiet and refined hobbies. His muscles were the result of his manager telling him to train... He was highly cooperative at work, but sometimes his thinking was a little different from the average person, leading to some hilarious outcomes.
 

 
His body management wasn’t wasted, and it caught the eyes of female fans, who were drooling over him.
 

 
A whole bunch of fangirls below were praising him like he was a "vampire young master" and showering him with compliments, excited about the upcoming performance of both Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang. Some even jokingly wondered if they would release a duet soon.
 

 
Regardless, the hype was definitely there, and it served its purpose in promoting the movie.
 

 
Who has ever seen a movie promotion where the female lead and the antagonist's actor have a real-life offline PK (battle)?
 

 
This is too daring!
 

 
Other movies with concurrent promotions were dumbfounded.
 

 
Some movies had originally thought that having the main cast change into Qing Dynasty costumes during pre-screening warm-up activities would be innovative and creative enough for their promotions. But they didn’t expect that others would take a sharp turn and overtake them... Some promotional teams, not minding being accused of copying others, turned their focus to their own leads.
 

 
But upon reflection, they realized it wouldn't work.
 

 
In a romance movie, having the male and female leads fight each other? Is that even appropriate?
 

 
As for female celebrities in the entertainment industry who could rival Tong Zhao in fighting ability...
 

 
It's hard to think of many.
 

 
With their delicate arms and legs, how could they possibly fight? Wouldn’t their fans tear them apart?
 

 
Instead, now, Jiang Dang’s fans, after learning about Tong Zhao’s fighting skills, were cautiously pleading with her fans on her Weibo, asking her to go easy on him—no punches to the face, no hits to the head, considering he already had some issues to begin with.
 

 
This was a stunt only Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
The industry was in awe.
 

 
Although no one explicitly said it, everyone secretly thought that Tong Zhao was very clever—not only was she pulling stunts on variety shows, but she also dared to engage in such bold operations in real life! No one expected this to have nothing to do with Tong Zhao at all—it was actually Jiang Dang's sudden whim that made the movie's promotion work.
 

 
The promotional effect was so good, and discussions were happening everywhere.
 

 
Wei Zekai, slyly, posted a Weibo saying, "What's the big deal, I’ve already fought with Tong Zhao before."
 

 
Gossip-loving netizens were curious about the outcome.
 

 
@WeiZekaiV: "No comment."
 

 
This mysterious expression was something everyone who knew him could understand—it was obvious he lost the fight, and not only did he fail to fight back, even if he did, it wouldn’t have mattered. Some netizens, taking it seriously, even drew a relationship chart, making it look like a stock market analysis, where Wei Keke was holding steady with his childhood sweetheart, while Jiang Dang was the unexpected, rising star... Some even said...
 

 
[If you like the crazy type, why not consider Shi Qianqiu?]
 

 
[Among these jokers, how normal is Wan Zhi-ge!]
 

 
While waiting for a movie, Song Wanzhuo, surfing the internet, really wanted to say, "Please don’t mention me."
 

 
Recently, he had been seeing Tong Zhao’s action star outfits everywhere, and he was about to unfollow her.
 

 
He wanted his delicate, soft, loving favorite back!
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
Someone asked him what he thought about his beloved Tong Zhao’s new movie, and he casually flipped through his Weibo, showing his support for her: [Watching it in my private holographic theater /smiling face]
 

 
Though he was telling the truth, there was an inexplicable sense of smugness emanating from his words.
 

 
So, the netizens who were following the gossip quickly had their attention diverted by his shameful display of wealth.
 

 
Finally, the day of the live broadcast arrived amid great anticipation.
 

 
The official team had rented a legitimate, large-scale boxing arena. The protective gear, equipment, and the venue were all legal and in compliance with regulations. The promotional photos posted on Weibo beforehand also looked very formal, highlighting the official's serious attitude and piquing the interest of some netizens. While romantic relationships between handsome men and beautiful women are common, it’s rare to see such a scenario where the handsome guy and beautiful girl are fighting each other.
 

 
Though they were called to "fight," it wasn’t entirely accurate.
 

 
When Tong Zhao arrived at the boxing gym, she found that Jiang Dang had already changed into his gear and was warming up. Although he moved slowly, his movements were quite precise. Tong Zhao was a little surprised: "Have you trained before?"
 

 
Muay Thai, karate, and taekwondo are all popular options.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang had challenged her, he must be a martial arts enthusiast with some skills, right?
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Jiang Dang looked up at her with a confused expression, his handsome face showing a hint of, "I have no idea what you're talking about," and replied, "Trained in what? Martial arts? No, just regular fitness stuff."
 

 
"......"
 

 
Wait, what’s with that confusion?
 

 
"Then why did you challenge me to a match?"
 

 
Sitting down, Jiang Dang turned his head back, his thick eyelashes casting shadows over his eyes, and the deep contours of his face disappeared into the darkness as though he was plotting a world-altering conspiracy: "My subconscious is easily influenced by roles. Since I didn’t get enough fighting in the movie, I thought I’d try it in real life."
 

 
Moreover, in the movie, there was a fight choreographer to handle the action scenes, and Jiang Dang felt quite dissatisfied.
 

 
The second half of his sentence, the dissatisfaction, was kept to himself. He didn’t say it out loud, and it made him look a little pitiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she hadn’t asked him this question, she probably would’ve taken him down instantly.
 

 
She was professionally training in martial arts, and her strength was on par with that of heavier men. If she had been serious and ready to fight, it would have taken her only two or three seconds to subdue Jiang Dang. With Duan Ge’s personality, she could have easily taken out an opponent in three seconds. If she had any useful information to extract, she could break his legs or tie him up and ask.
 

 
Duan Ge, with righteous confidence: [The villain dies from talking too much.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [So, you’re putting yourself in the villain’s role now?]
 

 
[Being a villain doesn’t come with many moral burdens,] Duan Ge asked: [So, what do you think? Should I go in for the fight later?]
 

 
Tong Zhao hesitated.
 

 
She felt that sparring with Jiang Dang would be a tough task.
 

 
Since it was a movie promotion, she couldn’t just go up and take him down instantly; the fight needed to look good, with some back-and-forth. Letting him hit her was also an art form in itself, even more complicated than going all out. She wasn’t sure if Duan Ge could handle it, as she only let her female friends win…
 

 
What they were thinking was obvious to each other, and Duan Ge immediately said she could go ahead, letting her take the lead.
 

 
[Alright then…]
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended to reluctantly step aside, letting the main personality take over.
 

 
But she was actually quite willing.
 

 
No one told them that the live broadcast had already begun.
 

 
The official staff had only subtly reminded them that anything that shouldn’t be heard by the public should be kept to themselves once they entered the venue, because the staff at the boxing gym were not under their control and could easily post anything they overheard on Weibo.
 

 
This cute conversation was overheard by the audience who had entered the live stream.
 

 
[Wait, so Jiang Dang was the one who suggested this sparring challenge???]
 

 
[He really showed what it means to have a death wish. Isn't it good enough to be alive?]
 

 
[Hahaha, Tong Zhao's confused expression is too funny! GKDGKD!]
 

 
There were also fans of Jiang Dang praising his physique, saying it wasn’t photoshopped.
 

 
Jiang Dang was the type who looked slimmer when dressed. Usually, he didn’t show off much, but now with his shirt off, his biceps and triceps were well-developed, and his lines were clearly defined. From an appearance standpoint, he seemed to have the upper hand: [Jiang Dang’s body management is on point, the muscle mass is right there. A woman’s punch probably wouldn’t stand a chance.]
 

 
[True, even a guy would struggle with taking that punch.]
 

 
[The two of them aren't even in the same weight class.]
 

 
Aside from the obvious gender difference, boxing matches are also divided into different weight classes, because even if a punch lands in the same spot, the damage and impact are different when thrown by a 200-pound fighter versus a 140-pound fighter.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, it seemed like an unfair match.
 

 
Duan Ge, completely unaware of the ongoing online discussions about her, changed backstage and fully equipped herself, warming up for a bit. Meanwhile, she began to play around with the gym's punching bag equipment.
 

 
The punching bags were solid, and after testing her strength with a few punches, Duan Ge found they could easily withstand her force, so she started putting in more effort.
 

 
A left jab, a right roundhouse kick, and a left cross punch.
 

 
The sound of her strikes was so intense that the staff at the gym turned to look. The live stream’s comments were filled with 666666.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so A, I’d love to be hit by her 555555.]
 

 
[I suspect she’s the most attractive M-type female celebrity.]
 

 
[I feel like one of her kicks could knock my head off...]
 

 
Admiration for strength is a human instinct.
 

 
Watching Tong Zhao’s pre-match performance, it seemed to hint that an exciting match was about to unfold. The audience in the live stream was getting excited, their anticipation growing. Some couldn’t hold back and started recommending it in their social media posts, calling their friends to come watch.
 

 
There were even betting odds posted on gambling sites about who would win.
 

 
The joys and sorrows of people don’t always align.
 

 
The netizens were celebrating, while Jiang Dang's fans were nervously sweating.
 

 
[Maybe we should just not have the match, I’m so scared qwq]
 

 
[Don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head.]
 

 
[Will my brother die from one punch?]
 

 
When the two walked onto the stage, the popularity in the live stream soared like crazy. The backstage staff were puzzled and asked each other, “I haven’t started adjusting the backend data yet, have you?”
 

 
It’s an industry unspoken rule that the viewer and audience numbers for live streams can be inflated to make the numbers look good.
 

 
For paid content like variety shows and movies, inflating the numbers is strictly forbidden, so the data is trustworthy. However, since this was a promotional pre-event, slight adjustments to the data wouldn’t be considered illegal. The staff hadn’t even adjusted the numbers yet, but they watched as the figures shot up as if someone had activated a cheat code.
 

 
“No, I haven’t!”
 

 
“I haven’t either.”
 

 
“You’re the only one with access. Did you burn out from overtime or something?”
 

 
The staff member who had asked was met with a barrage of complaints, but his face was full of smiles. “Guess that means this is real data then... feels like a dream. Let’s tweak the keyword data for the comments.”
 

 
This was the best way to see who was pulling in the crowd.
 

 
On the monitoring screen, it was clear who was the King of audience attraction.
 

 
“75% of the comments are related to Tong Zhao…”
 

 
At this point, the staff sighed, “Whoever gets the traffic gets the world. There were people before who complained about Tong Zhao's subconscious instability, but just look at her ability to create buzz—who wouldn’t want her for promotions? She’s so useful. It feels like she can meet any crazy idea. She's so dedicated.”
 

 
“The audience’s interest is what matters.”
 

 
No matter how boring a variety show is, as long as Sister Zhao is there, she can always make something fresh happen.
 

 
“Jiang Dang is more suited for talk shows,” someone commented.
 

 
While the staff discussed her, the timer for the boxing match was struck by the referee.
 

 
Though the official announcement said it would be free fighting, they ultimately chose the more traditional rules of boxing: three-minute rounds, one-minute rest between rounds, ten rounds in total. After being knocked down, the referee would count to ten, and if the knocked-down fighter couldn’t get up within ten seconds, the other would be declared the winner.
 

 
On the live stream, Tong Zhao, with bandages wrapped around her hands, was looking into the camera.
 

 
She jumped twice in place to loosen up.
 

 
Her black hair fell over her face, brushing past her cold, sharp eyes, piercing directly into the hearts of the female audience.
 

 
Even the girlfriend fans who came for Jiang Dang couldn’t help but admit that this sister’s A-game made it hard for them to feel any jealousy or competition. They just wanted to admire her beauty…
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t care.
 

 
She was talking to other personalities.
 

 
Han Zhi reminded her: 【Remember to go easy. It wouldn’t make sense to knock him down in the first round.】
 

 
Tong Zhao also thought she should give Jiang Dang some face.
 

 
If Jiang Dang were the type of man who looked down on women and provocatively challenged them... considering the rest time between rounds, she could have easily taken him down in eleven minutes. But Jiang Dang was more of a spontaneous type. During their roadshows, he had been polite and well-behaved, so she naturally took him into consideration.
 

 
This solo fight wasn’t to determine the winner between the two.
 

 
It was to promote the movie, so it had to look good.
 

 
Duan Ge: [...So what should I do?]
 

 
According to the rules of Japanese anime, a perfect fight should have the structure of a satisfying story—
 

 
The tension of seemingly mismatched opponents, the nervousness of occasional knockdowns, back-and-forth exchanges leading to the crucial moment, the villain boasting of their plans as they unleash their final move, while the protagonist, about to be defeated, explodes with inner power and turns the tables.
 

 
After Tong Zhao explained, Duan Ge: [Oh, so the challenge in this match lies here.]
 

 
With the unreasonable demands from the client, the fight went from being dull and tedious to something much more challenging.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was called over by Xiao Zhao to play with his hands.
 

 
...
 

 
The official live stream played the battle anthem.
 

 
The staff, both onstage and backstage, including Jiang Dang and the audience, were all watching intently.
 

 
In the first three rounds, Duan Ge worked hard to let Jiang Dang have the upper hand.
 

 
The staff at the boxing venue were quietly discussing, but Duan Ge didn’t hear them, since she was too busy handling her own situation—
 

 
Xuyi: [You’re hitting too hard, ease up a bit!]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Hey, stop dodging. It’s not like you’ll be hurt by that little bit of strength.]
 

 
Han Zhi reminded: [Remember to act like it hurts when you’re hit.]
 

 
Unexpectedly, after debuting in action films where she relied on her subconscious for her performance, Tong Zhao was now facing a challenge in acting during a promotional event. Duan Ge had to exert tremendous effort to keep her performance on par with Jiang Dang’s, occasionally showing signs of pain.
 

 
[I thought it would be a one-sided fight, but it’s actually pretty exciting?]
 

 
[It’s a bit entertaining! Tong Zhao’s movements are so agile!]
 

 
[In real life, fighting someone heavier means you have to rely on agility to win. It’s like that.]
 

 
In the back-and-forth tug-of-war, the score was tied.
 

 
By the fifth round, Duan Ge estimated it was time for the "villain laughs maniacally and humiliates the protagonist" scene.
 

 
But she missed one detail.
 

 
After gaining a slight advantage from the leniency, Jiang Dang didn’t boast or flaunt his strength. Instead, his gaze toward her became shy and almost infatuated.
 

 
...
 

 
This is crazy!
 

 
Xuyi: [The opponent isn’t cooperating…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Then let’s move into the counterattack?]
 

 
Han Zhi felt that something was off.
 

 
But Consort Chen, enjoying the chaos, urged Duan Ge to go ahead and hit harder, since she had already been letting him win in the previous rounds.
 

 
The counterattack, Duan Ge was familiar with, and there was no difficulty.
 

 
No more holding back and pretending to be weak, Duan Ge immediately relaxed. As soon as the boxing bell rang, she happily knocked him down in the next five rounds. From the bell ringing to Jiang Dang hitting the ground and the referee counting down the ten seconds...
 

 
It never took more than twenty seconds—it all happened so quickly.
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[What happened to the evenly matched battle??]
 

 
[Ah, so Tong Zhao was holding back earlier?]
 

 
Someone who seemed to have figured out what was going on jumped in to explain: [This is how it is, if they kept the pace of the last five rounds, wouldn’t the whole promotional event be ruined? So it must have been the director's request to let him win earlier.]
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had just finished playing with Xiao Zhao’s hands, ruffled her memory: [Didn't I tell you not to hit him too hard?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Don’t worry, he’s not hurt!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Then what about holding back?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I held back! I let him win several rounds earlier!]
 

 
...Well, it didn’t seem like there was a problem, except she forgot to continue the act in the later rounds.
 

 
The promotional team, unfairly blamed by the audience as the hidden force behind it all, felt wronged.
 

 
Jiang Dang didn’t last more than twenty seconds in the last five rounds, his body wasn’t badly injured, but he was dazed and looked a little downcast. His fans were worried and kept asking in the comments if he had been knocked silly.
 

 
The host also asked with concern: "Jiang Dang looks unhappy. Is it because he lost?"
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head and, with a hurt expression, looked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
“She let me win… I wanted her to really fight me…”
 

 
He sounded particularly wronged.
 

 
The fans, who had been worried just moments ago, paused for a second.
 

 
[Does he want to be knocked out?]
 

 
[So, am I following a star just to watch my house get flattened by Sister Zhao?]
 

 
[I think he’s really been knocked silly…]
# Chapter98
Due to the dramatic comeback by Duan Ge in the last five rounds...
 

 
The original livestream duration was no longer enough!
 

 
Everything happened so quickly.
 

 
The host, following the original plan, began asking both sides for their post-match thoughts.
 

 
Host: "Brother Dang, how do you feel right now?"
 

 
"Not enough."
 

 
Jiang Dang's physical stamina was good. It was said that he usually trains his lung capacity through swimming and running—though this was more of an urban legend, as lung capacity has no direct connection to singing ability. What mattered more was vocal technique. However, his ability to sing for five to six hours straight with a steady voice, and the fact that his voice had thickness and layers, was often praised by his fans.
 

 
After going through such high-intensity physical activity, Jiang Dang was still sitting on the bench with only a thin layer of sweat on his forehead and neck. The lights of the boxing gym reflected off him, his delicate and slightly devilish features carrying an unspoken vulnerability, which only solidified his title as the "top beauty" of the music world.
 

 
The host's lips subtly twitched, unable to hold back the truth:
 

 
"Wouldn't it have been better if you had lasted a little longer?"
 

 
"Yeah," Jiang Dang said without feeling offended, answering gently, "She's too amazing. When she got serious, I had no way to fight back."
 

 
Host: "Is it the same feeling you had when filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’?"
 

 
"When we were filming, the action designer helped me a lot, and it wasn't about my own abilities," Jiang Dang answered, remembering his manager’s reminder to always promote the movie, and added, "So, the audience can rest assured, the character Fu Xuancheng in the movie is not as weak as I am."
 

 
...You know you're weak!
 

 
The host almost couldn’t suppress his urge to make a sarcastic comment.
 

 
However, many entertainers, in an effort to take all the credit and glory for themselves, often deliberately avoid talking about action designers or voice actors during interviews—while not explicitly stating that those cool moves were not entirely their own subconscious abilities, the hard work of these behind-the-scenes professionals is often overlooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s active mention of this, however, made the host and some colleagues appreciate him a bit more.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang was so cooperative, the host steered the conversation back to the movie, cleverly plugging it. The viewers watching this were curious too, and began discussing the gap in combat skills between the two:
 

 
[The action designer worked hard. It must have taken a lot of effort to close that gap.]
 

 
[They probably set some limitations for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is the real-life heroine!]
 

 
Isn’t that right? Beautiful and tough, she fulfills many people's fantasy of a female hero.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick battle shower in the changing room, dried her hair, applied makeup, and changed into casual clothes before stepping out, where she was immediately greeted by the host's bright smile.
 

 
"Finished interviewing Jiang Dang?" she asked.
 

 
The host nodded and said it was her turn now.
 

 
She greeted the audience in the livestream.
 

 
Tong Zhao appeared in a white T-shirt and hot pants, smiling brightly at the camera. Fans on the bullet screen immediately flooded the chat with passionate declarations of love.
 

 
Host: "I heard this PK was proposed by Brother Dong. What did you think at the time, Sister Xiao?"
 

 
"I was quite surprised because I wasn’t very familiar with him at that time; we’d only exchanged greetings once or twice. But later, during the roadshow, we got to know each other better, and looking back now, it wasn’t surprising that he wanted to challenge me."
 

 
"Haha, speaking of the roadshow, you still didn’t get to have hotpot."
 

 
"Yeah, but when we went to Guangzhou, I brought him back some dim sum."
 

 
"As for how I felt about the challenge..."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment.
 

 
The camera zoomed in on her face, capturing a close-up of the mischievous smile in her slightly narrowed eyes: "In the first half, I was testing him. In the second half, it seemed like I hadn’t even started trying before he went down. Nothing special! It was pretty much the same as what we do in the movies."
 

 
[“I hadn’t even tried yet, how did you fall down?”]
 

 
[Who’s pretending? Oh, it’s Tong Zhao. Never mind then.]
 

 
[Sister Zhao is amazing 66666.]
 

 
[What does ‘pretty much the same as the movie’ mean? I really want to see the new drama now!]
 

 
Considering the limited conditions in real life, the match was already this exciting—how fierce would she be in the ‘Instinct’ movie?
 

 
This was the thought of most of the audience at that moment.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff worked efficiently, editing the ten-round showdown into a short video, which was promptly posted on Weibo. Related marketing accounts were also quickly set up to help with promotions, creating a wave of strategic marketing…
 

 
Seeing Brother Dong get beaten up, the onlookers couldn’t stop laughing.
 

 
Brother Dong was quite well-liked by the public, though he often came up with weird, out-of-the-box ideas.
 

 
If it had been a regular, normal male celebrity, netizens would have probably imagined that he was under some unspoken pressure, forced to perform this scene where he gets beaten by Tong Zhao, and some fans would inevitably feel sorry for him and complain…
 

 
But this was Brother Dong!
 

 
He himself said he was super happy to get beaten.
 

 
Not only that, he didn’t just want one round of getting hit; he wanted an unlimited refill…
 

 
So the public, with no psychological burden, happily shared and joked about it without any guilt.
 

 
The creativity of netizens is boundless, and one of the posts that garnered over six thousand shares was a meme.
 

 
The first one showed Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in the ring, with no expression.
 

 
The caption: "I can’t win."
 

 
The second one was even better—Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in a six-panel grid.
 

 
The caption: "I’m pretending."
 

 
The contrast was too funny, and it was clear that Tong Zhao was bringing something new to the table.
 

 
Due to the pre-and post-match promotional clips where Brother Dong repeatedly mentioned wanting to keep fighting, those who didn’t know the full story might have thought he had heroically beaten his opponent and was eager to continue torturing her. But it turns out he was the one who got beaten up? How surreal! Fans covered their faces, unable to watch any longer, and onlookers wondered if the livestream was still going. Was there more to see?
 

 
While watching the livestream and scrolling through Weibo, the audience's spirits lifted. They quickly shared the link.
 

 
The number of viewers in the livestream surged.
 

 
New viewers saw that the match had ended, but the original viewers weren’t satisfied yet. They shouted in the bullet screen, wanting more. After some quick calculations, the marketing team remembered Brother Dong’s traditional skill—singing. Brother Dong, wiping sweat with a wet towel, turned to the staff and asked, "If the time is running short, I can keep fighting with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Staff: "…"
 

 
The reactions from both the bullet screen and the staff were exactly the same.
 

 
Staff: "The fans want to hear you sing. Besides, Tong Zhao just fought with you and is exhausted."
 

 
In the boxing gym, there were some simple fitness equipment.
 

 
After hearing the staff, Brother Dong turned his gaze toward Tong Zhao. She was using the equipment for pull-ups, her arms and back engaging as she effortlessly pulled herself up. Those around her watched in awe, unable to believe how someone with her muscle mass could have such hardcore strength. While not quite at the level of "superhuman strength," her movements were incredibly light, as if the exercises were effortless for her.
 

 
But… "Exhausted?" Who are you kidding? Maybe you could fool a three-year-old.
 

 
The staff, caught in Brother Dong’s silent gaze, was speechless. He couldn’t blame Tong Zhao for not cooperating, as she didn’t know he was using her to convince Brother Dong. The staff was still trying to come up with a new excuse when Brother Dong smiled, curling his thin lips, and looked at the staff with an expression as if he had seen through their little scheme, yet still showing a tolerant smile. "I can sing."
 

 
His smile was warm.
 

 
Having just been outsmarted by Brother Dong, the staff was left with complicated feelings, turning them into four simple words: "Thank you, Brother Dong."
 

 
Fans in the livestream were excited to hear that Brother Dong would sing.
 

 
Some of the onlookers were about to leave.
 

 
But a portion of them knew that Brother Dong could sing well and wanted to hear him live—
 

 
Several of Brother Dong's songs had gone viral on Douyin, including "Sensual Lover" and "Stop Desire." Clicking on those songs, one could find hundreds of unique short videos showcasing abs and perfect timing with the music.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished letting Brother Dong win, she left the remaining time to herself.
 

 
The host asked Tong Zhao if she had ever heard Brother Dong sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and smiled, complimenting him: "It’s hard not to have heard of him!"
 

 
[Emotional Intelligence]
 

 
[Thank you, Sister Xiao, for praising our Brother Dong!]
 

 
[Brother Dong’s songs are good, but 'Stop Desire' is really too catchy. Every time I hear that BGM, I feel like a muscular man is about to jump out and pull up his shirt with a small whip.]
 

 
Brother Dong tilted his head: "Many people discovered my brainwashing songs through public loudspeakers on the subway and buses. Were you one of the victims?"
 

 
The air was still for a few seconds.
 

 
[Business Intelligence]
 

 
[The 'Emotional Intelligence' was written backwards, LOL.]
 

 
[So Brother Dong knows his songs are brainwashing!]
 

 
…
 

 
In the end, the livestream turned into a duet on the stage with the two of them singing a love song.
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao didn’t let another persona take over.
 

 
If the character "Consort Chen," who was best at singing, had taken over, the audience’s mood would have shifted. Tong Zhao’s singing skills weren’t bad; with more experience, her emotions were richer, bridging the gap with Brother Dong. Their two voices, which leaned toward a mature and sensual tone, perfectly expressed the emotions of "Stop Desire," even making them briefly forget that they were on a boxing ring, not a stage...
 

 
The audience was thrilled and said this time, they were truly hooked.
 

 
The promotional event came to a successful close.
 

 
Only Brother Dong, still upset, shot Tong Zhao one last glance after the livestream ended: "No next time?”
 

 
"No next time, I'm a female celebrity, not a fighter."
 

 
With one sentence, Tong Zhao shut down all of Brother Dong's thoughts.
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Being looked at with intense, affectionate eyes by a handsome guy, while he says he wants to "come again"—that experience was kind of new and intriguing. But if that "coming again" didn’t involve another fight, it would have been perfect. Just as the staff were organizing to go out for hotpot, Brother Dong missed his chance to talk to her again. The streetlight cast a warm, yellowish glow on his face, and his wet, shimmering eyes were filled with unspoken melancholy.
 

 
The moment their gazes met, Tong Zhao began to feel like the entertainment industry was a place where only the truly crazy survived.
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think we're still quite normal."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I should be the most abnormal one."
 

 
Han Zhi: "And the cutest one."
 

 
Other personalities agreed.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment and added a note: "That must also make me the most narcissistic."
 

 
...
 

 
Once the live broadcast and the subsequent data flow were out, Tang Yanhao, who played the male lead’s boyfriend Cheng Siwen in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, sent her a message.
 

 
Tang Yanhao: "Sis, I also want to get beaten up / crying/crying."
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. Could this be some kind of contagious mental state?
 

 
As Tang Yanhao explained, since the PK live broadcast, the audience had started to link Tong Zhao and Brother Dong together in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, creating a mutually beneficial bond between them. Meanwhile, his character—the real "CP" in the film—was completely forgotten, and Tang Yanhao was so bitter that he planted a whole room full of lemon trees.
 

 
He wasn’t mad at Tong Zhao, but he was furious with Brother Dong.
 

 
How could that guy come up with such a publicity stunt?
 

 
But getting angry at Brother Dong was the most pointless thing in the world.
 

 
After thinking it over, Tang Yanhao’s lemon-juice-soaked brain came up with a dim-witted idea—
 

 
Since Brother Dong’s beating became a trending topic, why not replicate that classic stunt?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…There’s really no need."
 

 
Tang Yanhao calmed down and thought it through.
 

 
The first person to take on the stunt is the one who creates the buzz, but the second one? It just seems like too much of a marketing gimmick.
 

 
Moreover, his image was different from Brother Dong's.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted him: "The box office of the movie will benefit you too, plus you have more screen time."
 

 
Tang Yanhao wasn't very familiar with her and wasn’t at her level in the industry. He was a bit flattered by her comforting words and thanked her for her kindness, saying he would look forward to the box office.
 

 
But then, he added:
 

 
"Next time there’s an opportunity to get beaten up like this, be sure to call me!”
# Chapter99
Tang Yanhao wasn’t about to give up.
 

 
He was convinced that Tong Zhao was like a good-luck charm that naturally attracted attention, and he secretly hoped to soak up some of her spotlight.
 

 
How did he go about it?
 

 
Whenever Jiang Dang praised Tong Zhao, he would follow suit.
 

 
“Recently, Tong Zhao has pretty much become the center of attention. When people mention ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, they almost think of her by default. As a co-star in this film, what’s your take on her?”
 

 
Ever since Tong Zhao’s rise to fame, questions like these—intended to stir up conflict—had frequently been asked to other actors in the film. Jiang Dang usually acted a bit clueless with unexpected questions (because his manager, fearing he might go off-script, would pre-write responses and send them to him over WeChat to memorize). But when it came to this question, he became surprisingly chatty, praising Tong Zhao extensively.
 

 
And yet, not even his most jealous fans felt insecure about his admiration for her.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had put it like this:
 

 
“I really admire her. There’s probably a misunderstanding with the public—somehow, the only roles I get offered are villains, the kind that the protagonist is supposed to be terrified of. But I’m actually such a gentle, friendly person, you know? It’s strange; being on a movie set and actually feeling fear was a first for me. Tong Zhao gave me this brand-new experience. When she looked at me on set, I felt like she genuinely wanted to kill me. It was exhilarating—I’d love to experience that in real life a few more times… but…”
 

 
But?
 

 
Sensing a juicy twist, the journalist’s interest was instantly piqued, hoping to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao from her fellow cast members.
 

 
Journalist: “But what?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was tinged with a sense of wistful longing, almost as if he was caught in unrequited admiration. “In real life, there’s too big a gap in our abilities. She’s way too skilled, always in complete control, and I never felt the threat of actually being ‘killed.’”
 

 
“…?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a subtle smile. “Still, there’s something interesting about that feeling of being toyed with. Gains and losses, I guess. Not something you get to experience every day.”
 

 
The reporter felt like a complete fool for thinking just a moment ago that they could extract any useful news from Jiang Dang's mouth.
 

 
This interview was so entertaining. The sense of connection between the two in the movie was even stronger, and Tang Yanhao was incredibly envious. He also wanted some of the spotlight. "I think this is pretty unfair."
 

 
Since his debut, Tang Yanhao had always maintained the image of a sunny, boy-next-door type. He spoke normally, with a bit of shy freshness, which entertainment reporters liked. Several reporters, hearing him mention "unfair" — a keyword that could stir up drama — immediately rushed to his side.
 

 
"Can you elaborate on what's unfair?"
 

 
"Is it bullying on set?"
 

 
"Did they get physical with you?"
 

 
It was getting a little out of hand.
 

 
With a look that clearly said, "What are you talking about, nonsense?" Tang Yanhao looked at the reporters and said:
 

 
"I think it's unfair that they didn't let me join in on the fighting competition. I want to play too."
 

 
"Bullying on set? What nonsense, Xiao Zhao treats me really well."
 

 
"Want me to complain about her? Fine, looks like I won't get out of here until I say something..."
 

 
Tang Yanhao thought for a moment, then came up with a set of words full of grievances: "She only fights Jiang Dang, never me. It's so biased. I’m clearly the top CP in her movie!" He almost slipped and said "crab legs CP," but thankfully stopped himself in time.
 

 
---
 

 
The entertainment reporters were beginning to feel that the actors from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ seemed a little off.
 

 
This interview allowed Tang Yanhao to gain a bit of the spotlight's fringe heat, and netizens jokingly called him the "most insignificant male lead" and urged him to hand over his secondary Weibo account – listening to him describe his "top CP" in such dramatic terms, he must have been shipping fanfiction couples all along!
 

 
However, this remains an unsolved mystery.
 

 
After all the questions, the reporter was unable to uncover any negative opinions about Tong Zhao within the crew, so they could only leave in frustration.
 

 
The girl's reputation among her colleagues was extraordinarily good.
 

 
When a few whispers did emerge, it was usually about how she didn’t engage much with others during breaks, often wearing an eye mask and pretending to sleep. However, other staff members would say, "What are you listening to? Tong Zhao is actually really nice. It's just that at first, when people tried to ask her which stock to buy for sure profits, she didn’t want to talk. Maybe that’s why some people held a grudge against her."
 

 
The reporter then remembered she also had the nickname of an investment genius.
 

 
The industry forecasted good box office numbers for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. Fans of action movies would definitely be satisfied, and the light, fun storyline was suitable for all ages. With director Shi’s and Director Deng’s subtle additions of personal touches, it also had some deeper layers, along with funny and contrasting moments to entertain the younger crowd…
 

 
However, the final box office of a movie is not always entirely determined by its quality.
 

 
Sometimes, it’s almost a mystical thing.
 

 
Most of the time, the reasons can only be inferred from the final box office results.
 

 
So, what would the box office trajectory of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ look like?
 

 
…
 

 
On the day of its release, the top trending spot was occupied by ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
At first, this was probably due to its massive hype.
 

 
However, once it reached the top, it never dropped. The gap between it and the second-place romantic comedy had already widened by over three million, making the competition jealous. Within just half a day of its release, its box office was already heading straight for eight figures – who could handle this?
 

 
Real-time projections kept rising.
 

 
Both online and offline cinemas were filled with people chasing the trend.
 

 
There were no scheduling factors online, but the issue was the promotion slots – cinemas with higher box office numbers would receive more promotional boosts, which in turn sold more tickets.
 

 
What made this film so good? Critics were puzzled.
 

 
If we talk about quality, of course, it wasn’t lacking.
 

 
But before its release, many thought it might become Director Shi’s Waterloo because modern martial arts movies were quite rare, and Tong Zhao’s concept of "two subconsciouses" sounded like a marketing gimmick…
 

 
From a god’s-eye view of the cinemas and the real audience reviews, a hint of its appeal could be seen.
 

 
The cinemas were filled with constant laughter, and viewers were even mimicking martial arts moves in the hallways after the movie…
 

 
[The immersion is so great, I suspect the screenwriter is a wuxia author.]
 

 
[Is this a super high-class movie? No, it’s not. It’s something really special, and after watching it, you’ll want to see it again.]
 

 
[I think ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is way more artistic.]
 

 
[The biggest similarity between ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is that they both look so satisfying. My six-year-old son is already calling for martial arts classes, but it doesn’t count toward school credits. It’s frustrating. I suggest parents secretly watch it without bringing their kids.]
 

 
In the data stream, the word "satisfying" appeared twice as often as "good."
 

 
The data doesn’t lie; it faithfully reflected the audience's feelings after watching the movie.
 

 
A movie that has depth, humor, and handsome men and beautiful women – a feel-good film whose box office far surpasses the tear-jerking tragic films. Indeed, a thought-provoking good movie can inspire the audience to think, spark discussions, and bring more new viewers into the theater. However, most people don’t want to cry twice for the same movie in the theater. Once you’ve seen a scene, it’s not as emotional the second time around.
 

 
Some of the lines written by Director Deng personally added depth to the film.
 

 
The movie's exploration of martial arts traditions came from the off-screen guidance of Director Deng from the Jingwu Martial Arts School.
 

 
The new era's interpretation of martial arts traditions, on the other hand, came from Tong Zhao’s subconscious improvisation.
 

 
Some audience members especially liked the intellectual clash between the protagonist, Xie Guiye, and the villain —
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was very angry, believing that the current era had forgotten the inheritance of Chinese martial arts, and that all the heroes had been abandoned by time.
 

 
Everyone, including the audience, thought that the protagonist, who had always shown a dislike for martial arts, would follow along and denounce traditional martial arts, but unexpectedly, Tong Zhao shook her head and replied, “What is martial arts? Swords, spears, halberds, axes, hooks, chains, whips, hammers, claws, sticks, staffs, and the meteor hammer – swordplay, sword techniques, knife techniques, and lightness skills. Being a hero is about eradicating evil and promoting good for the nation, not just learning some half-baked martial arts and cosplaying.”
 

 
Bullet comments:
 

 
[Xie Guiye hates martial arts, but can recite all 18 weapons. Brilliant!]
 

 
[This movie could also be called ‘Corporate Drones vs. Chuunibyou’]
 

 
Some sharp-eyed viewers noticed the subconscious shift in Tong Zhao’s character midway through and commented: [Early Xie Guiye: I’ll just criticize everything! Later Xie Guiye: I’ll just fight!]
 

 
…
 

 
@Instinct Film Scene: This entire March, a martial arts movie is dominating the screens! / Laughing and crying
 

 
It truly dominated the screens, with everyone talking about this movie.
 

 
Putting aside the continuous box office breakthroughs, the entire crew of the movie spent the entire month going to bed with smiles on their faces. While some discussed the box office, what really fascinated netizens were the various fan-made videos mimicking the main characters…
 

 
The leader of this trend was a Bilibili content creator named Shen Huo, who was said to be a male fan of Jiang Dang, with some rather unique ideas.
 

 
After ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was released, Shen Huo organized an event to meet the top-ranked fan offline, including round-trip airfare. The number one fan turned out to be a female netizen, and his fans were immediately shocked and couldn't believe it. They were amazed, "Does Shen Huo really have female fans?" and began imagining a love story between the male broadcaster and the wealthy female fan.
 

 
The female fan really showed up.
 

 
So what was the mystery activity for the meetup?
 

 
It was an imitation of the classic battle moves between the protagonists, Xie Guiye and Fu Xuancheng.

On the left, you have the original movie, with handsome men and beautiful women looking heroic.
 

 
On the right, you have an unenthused rich girl and a male host beaming with joy.
 

 
The amateur performers, with no martial arts background, had soft and weak moves, which was unintentionally hilarious.
 

 
[Don’t use the original movie to fool us!]
 

 
[Jiang Dang’s fans are terrifying in another sense…]
 

 
[Since you’re here, let me recommend our Shen Huo! Click on the creator’s album and check out the original songs!]
 

 
Well, this person is both messing around and singing.
 

 
After this meme spread widely, TikTok followed suit, with the most popular soundbite being "Master, this is a master!" The brainwashing voiceover became an almost spiritual pollution. If you hear it on a bus or subway and glance at someone’s phone screen, you’re almost certain to see scenes from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
Some core audiences thought this wave was very tacky, but it genuinely sparked more curiosity and led to more ticket sales...
 

 
With these spin-off memes so popular and the movie still in theaters, many decided to go watch it.
 

 
…
 

 
This expanded audience base later led to some hindsight criticism from certain movie critics…
 

 
"Analyzing Tong Zhao's Subconscious Success in Wealth Codes: A Walking Feel-Good Film Factory"
 

 
This review, shared over six thousand times, comes from a movie critic with millions of followers.
 

 
He summarized all of Tong Zhao’s movies, pulling out scenes from each one, and discovered that no matter how the script was written, her subconscious always turned the movie into a feel-good narrative. This is why the audience never gets tired of watching her—she has the same kind of comeback story as Cinderella, a timeless theme in storytelling.
 

 
The review hit the nail on the head regarding Tong Zhao's career and her fan base.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at it and felt that, to some extent, this person was right. The quick-paced, mission-completing characters she portrayed were indeed in line with the feel-good narrative style.
 

 
Along with the surge in box office and reputation, her market value skyrocketed.
 

 
The industry wondered, ‘Can she rise even more?’
 

 
During the time of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, her price was already sky-high, and she had decided to focus more on reducing her production and choosing higher-tier projects, unwilling to accept scripts she wasn’t interested in.
 

 
So, what kind of scripts does this box office queen like?
 

 
Inside Tong Zhao’s mind palace, a little one sat in the middle of the older siblings, feeling troubled in front of a pile of scripts.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why not just forget it?”
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Zhao Zai protested loudly, then mumbled softly:
 

 
“Only you guys get to play… I also want to contribute something to my sister!”
 

 
Consort Chen glanced at her: “You staying put is your biggest contribution.”
 

 
The little one was struck down by this precise hit, her eyes brimming with tears. She was comforted in the arms of Elder Lu. Zhao Zai shook her head and clenched her small fist: “It’s okay, I will definitely pick the right script.”
# Chapter100
Due to certain radical tendencies, the success rate of completed missions had significantly dropped.
 

 
Thus, with her consent, the persona of “Xiao Zhao” was created.
 

 
Xiao Zhao was somewhat unique. She retained faint memories of the first three world-hopping missions, but everything was filtered through a thick layer of innocence. She remembered once captivating an entire kingdom with a smile, leading a group of loyal comrades to survive the apocalypse, and even being a top-tier heartthrob adored by countless fans...
 

 
But what did that have to do with a little elementary school girl who loved drinking milk and eating lollipops?
 

 
Xiao Zhao was puzzled.
 

 
However, her predecessors’ experiences weren’t useless.
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s mission was to reduce the blackening risk of three major villains.
 

 
These three villains couldn’t simply be reformed with love and kindness.
 

 
The first villain was destined to be a cold, future scientific mastermind with a nearly superhuman intellect. He saw even adults as intellectually inferior, almost a different species entirely. Compassion from someone so “primitive” meant nothing to him. Xiao Zhao thought it over and decided to try the nurturing approach based on her older sister, Consort Chen’s, experience.
 

 
Despite his extraordinary intellect, the young genius’s sense of beauty hadn’t mutated.
 

 
Like other boys his age, he still recognized beauty and was quite mature for his age.
 

 
And so... the little genius fell.
 

 
But Xiao Zhao, tasked with an important mission, couldn’t linger on one villain. Just as he gathered the courage to confess his early feelings, she politely declined, telling him that she not only admired boys who excel academically but especially those who aspired to contribute to the country as great scholars.
 

 
The young genius:?
 

 
Eventually, the young genius was reformed, becoming a leading scientist who contributed positively to society.
 

 
#The Daily Life of a Stoic Scientist with a Romantic Heart#
 

 
The second villain was set on a path of revenge, distorted by a mix of cowardice and inferiority. He was a troubled child, born to a gambling-addicted father and a mother who silently endured domestic abuse. One day, his usually gentle mother unexpectedly beat him harshly over a trivial matter, chasing him out of the house. Frightened, he wandered outside until late, finally returning to find his mother hanging lifeless and his father poisoned.
 

 
The truth was that his debt-ridden father, desperate to pay a 500,000 yuan loan shark debt, had decided to kill his family for the insurance money. Having been abused and stripped of any will to resist, his mother saw no other way to protect her son than this tragic choice.
 

 
From that day on, the boy’s capacity for genuine emotional connection was broken.
 

 
Whenever others showed him kindness, it only made him anxious; only money gave him comfort. He always remembered the debt his father tried to repay that night, and later on, he became infamous for elaborate financial scams, amassing a fortune.
 

 
Xiao Zhao took a different approach to intervene. She gently nudged his mother, suggesting there were other ways than total destruction. She encouraged her to report the abuse to the authorities, to reach out to family services, and to establish connections with neighbors, creating a support network.
 

 
Villain: “All my suffering is because of poverty.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “You’re absolutely right! Here’s a profitable path for you—given your intellect, it’s a sure thing!”
 

 
Villain:?
 

 
Thanks to this intervention, he switched to a wealth-building path, investing in stocks and achieving success legitimately.
 

 
The third villain was a beautiful girl born into a family with a strong preference for sons. Growing up in a toxic environment, she later became an accomplice in perpetuating the same harm she experienced. Her parents, captivated by her looks, pushed her into modeling as a child star, and as she entered the entertainment industry, she became highly successful but quickly descended into moral decay. She began recruiting other young women to exploit for wealthy clients, forgetting her original love for acting and her dream of being admired by all.
 

 
Xiao Zhao extended a hand of friendship to this “little sister.”
 

 
Under her family’s influence, the girl had low self-esteem. Despite Xiao Zhao’s encouragement, she struggled to feel pride in herself, facing the choice of either sinking further into harm or becoming a target for manipulation.
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Do you really need to rely on others to feel valued?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Well, in that case, how about liking me instead?”
 

 
By becoming Xiao Zhao’s loyal “fan,” she found her self-worth.
 

 
Marriage for family honor? She only wanted to stay close to Xiao Zhao, so there was no need for that.
 

 
Buying a house for her brother? Maybe save for a castle for Xiao Zhao instead!
 

 
Xiao Zhao fulfilled her mission in this childlike seven-year-old “quick transmigration” world, reforming all three villains before their darker tendencies took root. Sadly, she couldn’t stay long enough to live a full life there, as the system transferred her to the next world before she could grow up—or date any of them!
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen prodded her soft, chubby cheek: “You look as intense as someone hustling for a phone screen protector under the bridge.”
 

 
Another poke.
 

 
The soft cheek dented slightly, and Consort Chen couldn’t resist poking again.
 

 
Finally, one poke too many, and Xiao Zhao snapped around, biting the tip of her finger.
 

 
It was the ultimate “look up and bite”!
 

 
Consort Chen: “...Let go.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao, mumbling with her mouth full: “Only if you stop poking my face.”
 

 
“Fine, fine, no more poking.”
 

 
Consort Chen reluctantly withdrew her hand, then elegantly wiped her fingertip on a silk handkerchief, brushing off imaginary saliva.
 

 
The scripts coming in for Tong Zhao were more varied than ever before.
 

 
In the past, most scripts were designed specifically for characters like Consort Chen and Duan Ge, with a few mixed in as attempts to get her to try unconventional roles as male protagonists. However, such bold requests were rare, and they were always small productions. Even if she was interested, the company could block her… Up until now, she’d been respectful of her manager’s opinions, and Han Zhi never pushed her to take on male roles.
 

 
Sometimes, he’d casually stream, chat with fans, and play games, practically becoming an ASMR streamer.
 

 
In short, no one was offering her child roles. Just as in traditional films, child characters in Instinct Films would still be played by real children. Since adults entering a child-modeled body carried an inherent discordance, it posed a high risk of incompatibility. Plus, there were plenty of kids willing to take on those roles.
 

 
As Zhao flipped through the scripts, her mood sank lower.
 

 
Just then, her phone rang, forcing her to pause and answer her agent’s call.
 

 
In her subconscious palace, Zhao lay like a defeated lump of rice cake in Lu Xianzhang’s embrace, her dreams crushed.
 

 
After explaining her new schedule, Sister Chu asked, “What are you up to? It’s awfully quiet.”
 

 
“Just reading through the scripts you sent me.”
 

 
Sister Chu wasn’t surprised; in fact, she was pleased with this response. Among her clients, Tong Zhao was by far the most hardworking.
 

 
“No rush. Or maybe look at some variety shows, if any interest you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked if she had any recommendations.
 

 
Sister Chu laughed and replied, “If I were to suggest something, take it with a grain of salt; your preferences are what matter. Based on your past films, the male leads have had low presence. Even when you’ve had love interests, they’ve ended up overshadowed by you. Like in ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where the male character was strong enough to hold his own, but only as a villain, not as a love interest. And in The Knives of the Maiden’, viewers felt Cheng Siwen wasn’t worthy of you—the main character is meant to shine alone.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s subconscious is more dominant than that of many famously strong male stars. It’s rare in East Asian culture, where female stars’ subconscious in Instinct Films often gravitates toward “completion” through marriage and children—a reflection of cultural influence.
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t have those thoughts, probably due to her strong sense of individuality formed during her transmigrations.
 

 
“There are critics who say your subconscious is too domineering; everyone’s eager to see you fall in love on screen.”
 

 
After sharing her thoughts, Chu quickly emphasized that she wasn’t pressuring Tong Zhao to take a romance-focused role. Tong Zhao was curious—she’d always known her company and manager respected her choices, so why the need for extra reassurance?
 

 
Sister Chu clarified:
 

 
“The industry now trusts your godly script-picking eye. The way every film you choose becomes a hit isn’t something analysis can explain—it has to be some kind of magic. I can’t mess with that magic!”
 

 
…
 

 
Magic, my foot!
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Superstitious nonsense.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Someone saw you meditating at the gym during the last roadshow.”
 

 
…
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: [The feng shui in that spot is great.]
 

 
"Alright, then let’s try some magic."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled. After hanging up the phone, she playfully imagined herself as others saw her: she tossed all the scripts into the air, waiting for them to fall, then picked up the one closest to her.
 

 
"Neverland Girl (Working Title)"
 

 
It was, surprisingly, a romance movie.
 

 
"Neverland..."
 

 
The term “Neverland” originates from the 1904 story ‘Peter Pan’, a tale known worldwide. The protagonist, Peter Pan, is a boy who doesn’t want to grow up—and never will. The story revolves around him and a little fairy. According to urban legend, the original version wasn’t so cheerful. When the boys on Neverland began to grow up, they were killed by Peter Pan for the “crime” of betraying the island by maturing. [Note]
 

 
However, the truth of that version remains unclear.
 

 
The most official final version is a much happier one, where children spend a blissful time on Neverland but ultimately choose to return home to face life’s responsibilities. In reality, no one can avoid growing up—except Peter Pan, a fictional character. Neverland serves as a place within a fairytale that embodies the author’s nostalgia and sense of loss.
 

 
But this film clearly chose the darker version.
 

 
The female lead is a second child, born after her elderly parents lost their first daughter and did everything in their power to have another child. After the tragic loss of their eldest, her parents’ mental states were shaken, and the main character grew up drenched in their overprotective love. Shielded from the outside world in their countryside mansion, she barely saw anyone else, and her parents were happy to see their little princess safe under their watchful eyes.
 

 
One day, she accidentally fell into a pond and, after being rescued, lost her memory.
 

 
She transformed into a child trapped within an adult’s body.
 

 
Her elderly parents were devastated, both by their inability to ignore their daughter’s condition and by their declining health, which made it impossible to keep her all to themselves. They spared no expense in hiring a doctor to treat her, and the story unfolds between doctor and patient, with the girl falling in love with him…
 

 
That’s the main storyline.
 

 
On the hidden side, the script reveals that before losing her memory, the female lead had somehow managed to acquire an unmonitored phone. Through it, she began to sense that her life wasn’t quite normal. Yet, understanding her parents’ grief and deep love for her, she chose to endure it.
 

 
But, as they say, using the internet without falling in love is a waste of bandwidth…
 

 
Through the phone, she fell in love.
 

 
Love became a trigger for her free will to awaken. After testing her parents’ reactions, she felt hopeless, believing her desire to leave home was a betrayal. But unable to ignore her yearning for freedom, she ultimately decided to drown herself in the pond.
 

 
That incident wasn’t an accident at all.
 

 
And the doctor wasn’t a real doctor, either.
 

 
He was actually a top-notch con artist who’d dropped out of high school—and also her online boyfriend.
 

 
If her parents had hired someone through normal means, they might have gotten a real doctor. But their exhaustive hiring process played perfectly into the hands of this seasoned con man.
 

 
The male lead, who refused to grow up and shunned responsibility, crosses paths with the female lead, who was forced to stay a child. In the secluded mansion, the two rekindle a strange connection and explore the meaning of growing up.
 

 
…
 

 
After finishing the script, Tong Zhao had only one thought:
 

 
“Maybe I really do have magical powers.”
# Chapter101
Tong Zhao sent the ‘Neverland Girl’ script to her agent.
 

 
She didn’t even glance at the crew members already attached to the project. After all, Sister Chu had previously told her that as long as she chose scripts she liked, everything else would fall into place. Any movie with her name attached would easily attract investors; many people wanted to work with her. That said, prominent male stars were often hesitant to collaborate with her—industry gossip claimed that working alongside her was never a win-win for male actors, and they merely ended up supporting her. Actresses, on the other hand, might have a chance to create an intriguing sisterly bond with her on screen.
 

 
There were even rumors that Tong Zhao was a lesbian.
 

 
She couldn’t care less about these tabloid rumors. Those sensational gossip columns, lacking any hard evidence, were filled with outrageous claims about her. According to their stories, she was attending eight social dinners a week, rumored to be involved with nine other entertainers—three of whom were allegedly women. They claimed the entire Zeshan crew was her “harem” and that she was so distraught by her fame she was contemplating suicide daily.
 

 
Without proof, none of it held much weight.
 

 
A luxury cast? No worries. With "Tong Zhao" on the bill, her name alone equaled a top-tier production.
 

 
She had already mentally prepared herself for the possibility of liking the script but ending up with a subpar production team. However, as soon as she sent the script to Sister Chu, she received a quick reply—six ellipses.
 

 
Puzzled, Tong Zhao asked and discovered the situation was worse than expected.
 

 
Unbelievable! Aside from the script, there was only a producer.
 

 
The producer was very young, with only one previous project to his name, which had completely flopped. As a result, he couldn’t even attract a director this time. How the project had gotten this far was anyone’s guess. After some thought, Sister Chu recalled, “I remember thinking the script was good at the time; I figured you might like it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “I do like it.”
 

 
“But,” she added, “no investment, no director, and no cast? Even though the script is great, it’s a bit beneath my standing.”
 

 
She had to consider the entire team.
 

 
Sister Chu assumed she was ready to drop the project, but Tong Zhao continued, “Give me the producer’s contact information. I’ll invest in this film myself.”
 

 
Sister Chu was stunned. “What are you planning to do now?”
 

 
“These instinct-driven films burn through money fast,” she warned. “Going up even a little in quality can easily cost the price of multiple homes… Besides, if you just express interest in taking the role, finding investors shouldn’t be an issue.”
 

 
Initially, Tong Zhao had just spoken on impulse.
 

 
This was the kind of script perfect for Zhao Zai. Not only did she want to act in it, but she wanted it to be made into a truly great film.
 

 
Who doesn’t dream of traveling back in time to give their younger self the care they deserve?
 

 
Righting past regrets, having that toy they never got, or fulfilling a dream—this was a chance for her adult self to become her childhood hero.
 

 
"Found anyone?"
 

 
"Don’t even mention a director—we can’t even find supporting actors. Whenever people hear the name Xu Yiming, they just want to run."
 

 
In China, the concept of a producer differs a bit from Hollywood. Often, directors end up handling producer tasks, but Xu Yiming is more of a traditional producer, frequently joking about being the "film industry foreman." He had reached out to countless people, casting a wide net out of sheer determination. He had held on this long because he genuinely believed in the ‘Neverland Girl’ script and desperately wanted to see it made into a film and then watch the finished product in theaters, knowing he had been the one to piece it together.
 

 
At a street stall, empty beer cans littered the ground beneath their table.
 

 
Xu Yiming had a strong tolerance for alcohol. Even after downing a case of beer with friends, he was still speaking in flawless Mandarin, though a hint of melancholy crept into his words. “I just don’t want this good script to gather dust. But if no one’s willing to shoot it, what can I do? I used up all my connections with ‘Blood Battle’, and now even my reputation won’t get me anywhere…”
 

 
“To be honest, if selling myself would help, I’d be willing to do it.”
 

 
His drinking buddy shook his head, joking, “Three cents won’t get you far.”
 

 
Hearing that his looks were only worth three cents made Xu Yiming even more dejected.
 

 
His friend cracked open a bottle of baijiu and poured a shot, saying, “Stop thinking about useless things. Just drink.”
 

 
Just as Xu Yiming was about to take the glass, his phone chimed.
 

 
“Got a message from the work group chat—let me check it first,” he said.
 

 
When Xu Yiming looked at his phone, he didn’t expect much. He figured it was just another polite rejection—someone else saying their schedule was full, or they didn’t feel capable of doing justice to the script. In reality, they just didn’t want to take on a project without a clear profit potential. Xu didn’t blame them; he blamed himself for being unable to pull things together.
 

 
But as he looked down at his phone, he froze.
 

 
He reread the message several times, sobering up in the process.
 

 
His drinking buddy, noticing how Xu kept staring at his phone and muttering, "This can’t be real…" was curious. "What’s going on? A few beers and you can’t even read Chinese?"
 

 
Xu Yiming flipped his phone around and showed him the message.
 

 
His friend was stunned.
 

 
"Wait, this Tong Zhao—is this ‘the’ Tong Zhao? Holy…!"
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s name left him momentarily speechless, in complete shock.
 

 
"Yeah, it’s her." Xu Yiming, seeing his friend more shocked than he was, actually felt a bit calmer. But he was still confused—he knew of Manager Chu, a well-known agent. By some miracle, one of her artists could take an interest in his project, but Tong Zhao? She was the kind of star directors would scramble to please. How did he get so lucky?
 

 
Not only did he get her interest, but she even mentioned investing.
 

 
What on earth was going on?
 

 
This felt like a gift from the heavens, with a golden ingot tucked inside.
 

 
A cold breeze swept through the street stall, but Xu Yiming’s face was flushed with excitement. He quickly typed up a reply, while his friend didn’t mind being ignored. Instead, he sat next to Xu, watching him negotiate and marveling, "Man, if Tong Zhao’s interested in your project, you must have just used up a lifetime of good luck. When we order a designated driver later, let’s not share a car. I’m worried you might get in an accident."
 

 
"Screw you!"
 

 
…
 

 
Despite his harsh words, Xu Yiming’s heart was racing. After getting Tong Zhao’s contact info and discussing her thoughts on the project, he decided to spend the night at a nearby budget hotel instead of going home.
 

 
Tong Zhao liked his project.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to invest.
 

 
Tong Zhao even offered to post in her social circle to see if she could find suitable collaborators?
 

 
This level of luck—he genuinely feared he’d be crushed by a falling sign if he drove home.
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao reviewed her finances; funding a low-budget romance film wouldn’t be a problem. But she wasn’t in a rush and told Xu Yiming to wait a bit.
 

 
Wait for what?
 

 
Wait for the final box office results of ‘The Knives of the Maiden.’
 

 
This well-crafted movie was also superbly marketed, with industry experts saying that Zhao’s self-made buzz had boosted it from a solid 7/10 to an 8.5 box office success. Some in the industry dismissed analytical explanations entirely, attributing it to sheer "Zhao magic."
 

 
But it wasn’t magic.
 

 
Audience appeal is a mysterious thing, and after her roles in ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘Heartless Tribulation,’ the name Tong Zhao now stood for one thing in people’s minds—her films wouldn’t be boring.
 

 
With immersive holographic viewings being the main draw of the box office, people were willing to pay good money to experience something truly unique.
 

 
Tong Zhao had become a guarantee of this unique viewer experience.
 

 
When one film succeeded, every subsequent one seemed destined for success as well. She had become a brand of sorts, an unofficial “logo” that assured audiences. Her peers in the same age range could only watch with envy, frustrated that there was nothing they could do to keep up.
 

 
Male stars initially found it amusing, until they realized that the quarter's top box-office film was once again hers. In her movies, male co-stars frequently got overshadowed, leaving some of them feeling a bit sore about it.
 

 
And ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ delivered an undeniable box-office milestone, reaching an impressive 3 billion under the enthusiastic support of her fans.
 

 
What were her competitors saying? Tong Zhao and her team didn’t care. Anyone could see that her trending keywords on search engines and social media far surpassed those of her peers. The numbers solidified her commercial value; if others once thought her fame depended on the acclaim of director Shi Dingjun, now people simply said that Shi had found the perfect lead.
 

 
Nobody else could have delivered the same impact in those climactic scenes and action sequences as her character, Duan Ge, did.
 

 
With data transparency in the post-immersive-cinema era, the usual tricks fans used to inflate numbers were ineffective. An artist’s commercial worth could now be measured directly through keywords and other data points, using straightforward formulas. It wasn’t magic or hype. Audiences genuinely were drawn to Tong Zhao’s name and willingly bought tickets for her films.
 

 
---
 

 
“I swear, they might as well title the next film ‘Tong Zhao’ already! Every piece of promo material is plastered with her name—did she pay off the whole PR team or what?”
 

 
“It’s impossible to browse online anymore. Open up any social media feed, and it’s all her. Are there seriously no fans getting tired of this?”
 

 
“I’m done. Going to my dance class. For the sake of my sanity, staying off the internet.”
 

 
These complaints echoed quietly among industry insiders.
 

 
One young assistant, trying to show off his inside scoop, whispered, “I heard Tong Zhao’s team plans to cut back her exposure once the movie's run ends. No more variety shows or interviews, maybe…” But he didn’t get to finish before a senior colleague shot him a withering glare.
 

 
They were still competing fiercely for variety show bookings, and he had the nerve to talk about Zhao’s team planning to scale back exposure?
 

 
What kind of movie star “humblebrag” was this?
 

 
Yet, his insider tip was right. Apart from a brief appearance at the celebration event, Tong Zhao withdrew to focus on reading scripts.
 

 
There was a reason ‘Neverland Girl’ had been turned down by so many actresses. The role required the protagonist to convey an intense sense of growing up as she regained her memory. This transformation, easily captured in traditional films, posed a unique challenge in immersive cinema. In other words, the script wasn’t particularly suited for this new format—just something the producer happened to love.
 

 
But as luck would have it, the project struck a personal chord with Tong Zhao.
 

 
She posted to her social circle:
 

 
"Thinking of making a romance film myself. Right now, it’s just me as the lead actress—no director yet."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: “Director reporting in.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Signing up for the male lead.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: “Count me in, I’m interested.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's agent: "No, you don't.”
# Chapter102
The agent really wasn’t thrilled about Song Wanzhuo working with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It wasn’t that he had anything against Tong Zhao—in fact, he, like Wanzhuo, was captivated by her portrayal of the noble concubine, completely spellbound. But from a business perspective, Tong Zhao’s subconscious dominance in sensory films was so overpowering that male roles barely stood a chance. Back in ‘Emperor Ming’, this was less apparent since the emperor’s character retained prominence, but audiences couldn’t help but notice how much they were drawn to her as the noble concubine, despite her limited screen time.
 

 
After that, everyone in the industry knew: she’s an attention magnet. Working with her wouldn’t boost male co-stars’ popularity at all. Jiang Dang, with his unique and intense subconscious presence, had been an exception, but as far as Song Wanzhuo’s agent was concerned, they couldn’t count on that. He knew his client’s strengths; Wanzhuo’s subconscious traits were calm and understated, ideal for serious male-centric roles, but he didn’t have the emotional pull for romance films. Involving him in this genre would be career suicide, so the agent was determined to hold him back.
 

 
The agent privately messaged him: “You haven’t even read the script and you’re saying you want in? Didn’t you just tell me yesterday you were going to be more selective?”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, “Who could resist Tong Zhao’s charm?”
 

 
His agent tried to bring him back to reality: “You can’t be this reckless!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s response was a casual, “I’m just an Easy Boy.”
 

 
The agent, realizing he was out of options, told him, “Fine, go talk to her. But don’t think she’ll necessarily want you, and remember—don’t agree to a low fee, no doing this for free.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo thought his agent was underestimating him. Sure, he liked her performance as the noble concubine, but as long as she didn’t act that irresistibly charming way around him, he’d be fine. He was completely rational about this.
 

 
So, he requested the script.
 

 
Xu Yiming, who had just woken up at the hotel, nearly had a heart attack when he saw Song Wanzhuo’s friend request notification.
 

 
Good thing he didn’t actually have a heart condition.
 

 
Finding out that Song Wanzhuo was considering auditioning for his movie made Xu decide to stay an extra couple of days at the hotel—no way was he risking the walk back!
 

 
---
 

 
From the title alone, ‘Neverland Girl’ suggested that the story’s focus would revolve around the female lead, fitting right in with Tong Zhao’s preference for script selection.
 

 
But upon closer look, the male lead's character was actually crafted with considerable care.
 

 
The male lead is a seasoned con artist, a man who can deceive just about anyone. With his striking appearance, he easily gains others' trust and favor. Using clever language and manipulation, he makes people think he has connections and influence, which leads them to go out of their way to please him. For instance, he once tricked the owner of a struggling luxury hotel into believing he had ties to major corporations and could bring in lucrative business deals.
 

 
The hotel, though in decline, was still fairly upscale, and the owner, desperate to turn things around, showered the male lead with perks—including expensive gifts, a stay in the presidential suite, and a tab for dining and entertainment expenses—all because he thought the lead was networking on his behalf.
 

 
After enjoying the perks, selling off the gifts, and making the most of his stay, the male lead vanished without a trace.
 

 
Since he left no incriminating evidence in their black-and-white chat logs, and the owner had eagerly offered the gifts without hesitation, there was no legal recourse. The lead was careful never to push too far with any single "mark," knowing exactly how much he could get without driving anyone to a breaking point or risking a showdown.
 

 
He knew these wealthy people, well-off and educated, wouldn’t waste too much time on a con artist. In this, he felt both pride and self-loathing.
 

 
On one hand, he found it amusing how easily he could fool these people, how transparent their psychological weaknesses were to him. On the other, he was acutely aware that he lacked their level of education and sophistication.
 

 
If he were the type to believe that “education is useless,” he might have felt more at peace. But this is where the male lead's self-awareness becomes his curse—he knows the value of knowledge, he knows education matters, and he envies those students who can study freely on campus, unburdened by life.
 

 
“He’s the kind of lead that gives you a feeling of ‘something’s not right,’” Song Wanzhuo muttered to himself as he analyzed the character, instinctively envisioning how his own subconscious traits would interpret the role, as any actor would. “He has a sort of self-destructive mindset…”
 

 
The male lead meets the female lead when he hears about some online scams and decides to try his hand.
 

 
In the world of con artists, he’s a ‘real-life success’ type.
 

 
After all, with his looks, his captivating voice, and his persuasive body language, he can easily gain people's trust. Typing on the internet, though, comes off a bit cold and unconvincing to him. He'd heard about a scam called a "pig butchering scheme" that supposedly makes big money, and he found it intriguing.
 

 
The most common form of a pig butchering scheme is a romance scam. Scammers build a relationship with their target, then persuade them to invest or gamble on a specific app. The victim, believing they'll make a fortune, sometimes even takes out loans to continue. Under the scammer's influence, they’re convinced that it's a sure bet with no risks, often ending up deeply in debt and completely devastated.
 

 
On his very first attempt, he encounters the female lead.
 

 
The female lead, with her open-hearted trust in people and her eager, optimistic outlook on life, is everything he lacks.
 

 
And there’s a certain innocent naiveté about her.
 

 
He often finds it hard to believe that in this "5G era" there could be such a clueless girl.
 

 
He convinces himself that she knows a lot about the lifestyle of the wealthy and can teach him about expensive tastes and knowledge he might use in future scams. This justification keeps him from actually scamming her.
 

 
The "romance" scam ends at the stage of "falling in love."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh, come on!"
 

 
Are you really trying to scam her? Or are you just tempted by her innocence?
 

 
The female lead eventually shares her real background, revealing how trapped she feels in her family’s cage of "love." She’s afraid of the outside world but longs to escape, torn between her desire for freedom and her unwillingness to hurt her parents. Just listening to the male lead talk about the outside world brings her joy.
 

 
The outside world? How is he supposed to explain his life to her?
 

 
Tell her he’s just a conman with no real job, and barely any education?
 

 
The male lead doesn’t even know what a “normal” life looks like. He comes from a very dysfunctional family—his parents divorced, each remarried, and his father would hit him whenever they met, saying that if he scared him enough, he wouldn't come around asking for money. His father would tell him to go to his mother for support. But his mother was also struggling to survive; she’d remarried and quickly became pregnant again, trying to secure her place in her new family.
 

 
Asking his impoverished mother for money was out of the question, so he had no choice but to rely on himself.
 

 
He doesn't view his troubled background as an excuse for his crimes. He knows that no one's money is easily earned—he just doesn’t care anymore. Inside, there’s a rebellious child who uses his intelligence to live recklessly.
 

 
The script’s description of the male lead’s background is rich, but the narrative downplays it.
 

 
From the perspective of the female lead, who grew up pampered, everything seems rosy.
 

 
After a suicide attempt that results in amnesia, she’s like Alice wandering into a magical world—innocent, pure, and beautiful. Eventually, a handsome and elegant doctor pulls her out of this "dream," reminding her of her long-forgotten desire for freedom. Excitedly, she asks the male lead, "So, you’re here to take me away, right?"
 

 
The male lead looks at her quietly for a moment, then tells her another truth.
 

 
He reveals his real identity and the true nature of the world he knows:
 

 
Male Lead (calmly): "The world outside isn’t as colorful and fun as I described. It’s full of wolves like me, people with bad intentions. Part of the reason I encouraged you to run away was because I wanted to see you lose your innocence. I’m full of malice, do you understand? The boyfriend you’ve been so fond of—that’s who he really is. And the people you don’t like? They’re even uglier."
 

 
Male Lead: "Your parents may have a strong need to control you, but you have a good life. You have the luxury of never having to grow up."
 

 
The male lead thinks that if he continues using his cleverness just to get by, he’ll never be worthy of such a wonderful girl. There’s no such thing as a boy who can't grow up; there's only a boy who hasn’t met the girl he wants to be responsible for.
 

 
He also knows that because of his past recklessness, he doesn’t deserve to compete for this little princess’s love.
 

 
The weight of everything he’s shared is too much for the female lead to process all at once. She’s stunned for days, and by the time she regains her senses, he’s already gone.
 

 
This leads into the "real-world" storyline: the rosy lens of the luxury estate fades, and he returns to the cold, gray concrete jungle. The male lead finds a legitimate job, attends night classes to improve himself, and scrapes together money to repay his past victims, with interest. He wants to erase the fact that this girl he once adored had fallen for a con artist.
 

 
So, this character who seemed like a prince for four-fifths of the film is now working in sales. He has to meet performance targets and study late into the night.
 

 
The male lead used to believe he’d be a con artist forever.
 

 
The lessons he learned from the female lead don’t go to waste. Slowly, he finds his way and puts his life back on track. When things are tough, he imagines the little princess, living carefree in that lavish estate...
 

 
Reading up to this point, Song Wanzhuo feels the same way.
 

 
But then he reaches the three possible endings…
 

 
1. First Ending: After the male lead confesses the truth, the female lead's view of the world shatters, and she decides to retreat back into the safe, warm nest of her parents. Her controlling parents gain an even more obedient daughter, and she soon forgets the “doctor” who had vanished so abruptly. When she reaches a suitable age, they arrange a match with a well-connected young man, and she has a multimillion-dollar wedding that makes the news—something the male lead catches on TV.
 

 
2. Second Ending: After a brief period of fear, the female lead’s curiosity about the real world only grows stronger. She has a huge fight with her parents, finally gaining her independence. The male lead was right—her parents truly love her but were unaware their parenting style was flawed. Though her rebellion initially hurts them, it ultimately leads to a healthier and lasting parent-child relationship.
 

 
The female lead quickly catches up on over 20 years of real-world knowledge and eventually sets out to find the male lead.
 

 
But by the time she finds him, he has already died from overwork.
 

 
At that point, he’s managed to pay off his debts entirely, leaving behind only a final letter for her.
 

 
At this point, Song Wanzhuo feels a pang in his stomach.
 

 
3. Third Ending: This one is similar to the second, but when the female lead finds him, she realizes that he’s lost his glow. The boy she once loved was an illusion, and instead, the male lead has indirectly helped her complete her last stage of “growth.”
 

 
The prince was a lie, and reality is the dragon.
 

 
After leaving the castle, the little princess is able to pick up her own sword.
 

 
The agent, having finished the script as well, messages Song Wanzhuo: "Wanzhuo, I actually think you'd be a great fit to play the super controlling dad."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: "?!"
 

 
Since love stories are challenging within the instinctual film genre, having multiple endings is fairly typical. Song Wanzhuo thinks over the male lead’s complex character and, betting on Tong Zhao’s streak of hits… even if he doesn’t gain much, boosting the box office numbers could be worth it!
 

 
So, he sends in his interest for the role.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo felt pretty confident. After all, Tong Zhao's films typically don't make the male lead a big draw, so there shouldn't be that many male stars eager to play the part, right?
 

 
Well, he was wrong.
 

 
Quite a few actors started asking if Tong Zhao was really going to do a romance film, and if the male lead would actually have a lot of screen time—or would it ultimately turn into a mystery thriller? Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh at all the questions, realizing she should probably start lining up a director to let them handle the casting headaches.
 

 
Fortunately, finding a director wouldn’t be too hard.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had already expressed a genuine interest in directing the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I'm thinking about financing the film myself. Romance films tend to be costly and hard to break even on, so I don’t plan to take on any other investors."
 

 
Director Shi was known throughout the industry for making only high-budget films.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Which makes it all the more interesting!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It would be my first time directing a film with a budget of only forty million. I’m really curious to see what it’s like to work with such a cash-strapped production!"
 

 
…
 

 
You can't help but think, if it weren’t for his money, how has this guy managed to live this long without someone taking a swing at him?
# Chapter103
Low-budget production means low tolerance for mistakes.
 

 
At the very least, there would be no room for the luxury that Director Shi Qianqiu had when filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where he could simply reshoot scenes when they didn’t come out perfectly.
 

 
When Tong Zhao reminded him of this, he sent back a wide-eyed, startled cat meme, looking left and right. What kind of reaction was that?
 

 
Picture this: like telling a high-roller accustomed to casual online games that they’ll now have to play a subscription-based game. “Sorry, dear, our game doesn’t have auto-navigation, and spending money won’t make you stronger.” Imagine the look of shock on their face—that’s the vibe Shi Qianqiu was giving off.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Just messing with you.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Do I look like the kind of fool who wouldn’t think of something so basic?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Like a rich person with no common sense.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Not talking to you. (Cat meme)]
 

 
…
 

 
How much does this guy love using cat memes?
 

 
Tong Zhao sent him the script, telling him to think it over.
 

 
After putting her phone down, she headed to the bathroom, filled the tub with hot water and added some bath salts, ready to enjoy a relaxing soak.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found Tong Zhao absolutely fascinating.
 

 
If anyone else were self-funding a film for the first time, and he expressed interest in directing, they’d probably jump at the chance—after all, just having Shi Qianqiu’s name on a film guarantees ticket sales and a solid return on investment.
 

 
It wasn’t arrogance; it was simply the objective reality based on the reputation Shi Qianqiu’s movies had built over time.
 

 
A third-rate director has to beg for investments, while a first-rate director has investors lining up to hand over their money.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought Tong Zhao was interesting, but not in an arrogant way, “she’s the only actress who isn’t fawning over me, and now she has my attention” way. No, he was genuinely intrigued by this unconventional person who seemed to pave her own path. It made him want to follow her journey—to work with her on a creative project, which promised a new, doubled sense of freshness and excitement!
 

 
Based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Shi Qianqiu had only self-actualization left to pursue.
 

 
“Let’s take a look at the script first.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu rotated his wrist, and the text from the script projected into the air from his smart watch.
 

 
The latest model was surprisingly stable, allowing him to work on his own tasks while viewing the document.
 

 
…
 

 
When Tong Zhao came out of the bathroom, steam enveloped her face, giving her an air of lazy softness, as if the warmth had soaked into her very nerves. She lazily toweled off her hair with a blow dryer while glancing at her phone, wondering what silly thing Shi Qianqiu had said this time.
 

 
It wasn't easy to keep up with everything.
 

 
Ever since she posted that social media update and word got out that she intended to personally fund a romance film and star in it herself, her work messages had been non-stop.
 

 
Most of them required serious replies.
 

 
Fortunately, those who managed to merit Tong Zhao’s attention were generally polite and professional—no one was too pushy over a movie with an uncertain future. As for work acquaintances she barely remembered, she just replied uniformly: “There won’t be many roles in this new project. Details will be handled once we find the right director. I’m just providing the funding and acting; everything else is yet to be decided.”
 

 
If anyone pressed further, she ignored them.
 

 
Some messages were purely out of genuine concern, like from Director Shi and several other established figures in the film industry who told her not to hesitate to ask if she needed help from any of her mentors.
 

 
Tong Zhao believed they were sincere.
 

 
But ‘Neverland Girl’ had no action elements, so she could only politely acknowledge their kindness.
 

 
She scrolled down to Shi Qianqiu’s message window.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “The script is quite romantic.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Recently, no major romance films have been hits. Compared to blockbuster effects-driven films, the success of romance at the box office is always a bit of a gamble. At least half of the industry investors have no clue what kind of love story can genuinely move audiences.”
 

 
Seeing this made Tong Zhao chuckle.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu talking about romance?
 

 
The message was sent a while ago, but it was as if Shi Qianqiu had predicted her reaction and preemptively added:
 

 
“Don’t laugh. Just because I’m not interested in romance doesn’t mean I’m clueless.”
 

 
“There’s still a demand for romance films. If you can release a quality one at this time… hmm, is this part of your plan? Market research done? No wonder they call you the Midas of the industry.”
 

 
Although the "Midas touch" nickname had a hint of sarcasm, Tong Zhao found that, under Shi Qianqiu’s analysis, her project selection actually sounded incredibly sensible. In just a few sentences, he outlined a profitable path forward!
 

 
She knew that Shi Qianqiu had often taken on the producer role for his past films as well.
 

 
If he weren’t already wealthy, he would have made a fantastic fundraiser.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t boast about his skill or claim he could guarantee box office success. Instead, he simply and sincerely discussed the film’s potential with her. Nothing mattered more than having a director who truly understood film, and after their chat, Tong Zhao made up her mind and happily created a group chat.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Yiming was enjoying a meal at a fast-food place near his home.
 

 
He figured it was about time to head back.
 

 
Ever since the news got out, everyone he knew suddenly switched their tone, trying to buddy up to him. Xu Yiming knew full well that while they might be currying favor with him, the real attraction was the "Tong Zhao" brand. He might have been pleased, but he didn’t bother with any "you didn’t care for me before, but now you can’t reach me" speeches.
 

 
Still, he figured that since there was no shortage of candidates, he could skip over those who had previously rejected him and weren’t particularly outstanding.
 

 
It’s easy enough to find general crew members, but finding a good director is tough.
 

 
With a sigh, Xu Jianming, who was in the middle of lamenting his baldness, suddenly got a notification that he’d been added to a new group chat.
 

 
He looked down.
 

 
"[Tong Zhao] invited you to join the group chat. Other participants: Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is the director I found."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "For the male lead, I want final veto power. Everything else is up to you."
 

 
She said “up to you,” but in reality, she was planning to observe quietly.
 

 
When it comes to making films, Shi Qianqiu certainly has more experience than she does. Watching him up close as he oversees the production, from start to finish, would surely teach her a lot. As for her veto right over the lead actor, Shi Qianqiu readily agreed; in romance films, this kind of decision-making is quite standard...
 

 
If one of the main roles is played by a big star, then ideally, the casting of their on-screen partner would at least match that star’s aesthetic taste without clashing with the character’s personality. Otherwise, any visible tension or indifference would only feel awkward once filming began.
 

 
Both of them approached this rationally and methodically, leaving Xu Yiming completely baffled.
 

 
…
 

 
Wait—Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He rubbed his eyes. Was he seeing this right? This was the most unlikely director to recruit! Everyone knew that Director Shi always preferred to write, direct, and fund his own projects. How could a small-budget film with a $40 million budget possibly get him on board? It wouldn’t even be enough for him to go wild with.
 

 
Xu Yiming didn’t dare bring this up; he was too afraid of scaring off his idol.
 

 
He controlled his excitement, added Shi Qianqiu as a friend, and checked his social media to confirm that, indeed, this was the acclaimed director he had dreamed of working with. Exhaling with relief, he suddenly found the humble snacks in front of him tasted like Michelin-starred cuisine.
 

 
No need to go home.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu on board? His luck must be so good that it’d be safer to stay indoors, avoiding any chance of a freak accident.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao’s phone buzzed with a video call from Jiang Dang.
 

 
A video call?! Who even does that these days? A regular call would’ve been intimate enough. Tong Zhao was a bit taken aback, but since she’d just finished her bath, changed clothes, and blow-dried her hair, she answered without any hesitation.
 

 
On her screen appeared Jiang Dang’s strikingly beautiful, almost surreal face.
 

 
"I'm here to audition," he said.
 

 
On-screen, Jiang Dang was in casual clothes, with a guitar hanging on the wall behind him at home. When he appeared publicly, his team always paid careful attention to his appearance—his manager insisted that since his intellect was a bit off, his looks should make up for it. Jiang Dang looked effortlessly stunning in anything he wore, with a presence that made him an instant heartthrob for countless fans. His aura exuded a certain cold, forbidden charm.
 

 
Although he was somewhat absent-minded, his deep, soulful eyes captivated anyone who saw him.
 

 
With a serious tone, Jiang Dang began analyzing the benefits of them working together.
 

 
First, he explained, their “couple” pairing from The Knives of the Maiden had gained huge popularity; in online communities, many fans perceived their on-screen chemistry as undeniable. By announcing their collaboration now, they could capitalize on the previous film’s momentum.
 

 
Second, he added, he was very emotionally expressive—after all, the fact that he had written so many beloved love songs was proof enough.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s voice was low and melancholic, but his words were pure business.
 

 
He actually made a solid case.
 

 
Despite their characters being hero and villain in the film (with the hero having an official boyfriend), their pairing had somehow amassed a surprising following. Fans adored it, and video editors loved splicing their scenes together. With so many press events and promotional tours featuring them together, for fans, this was the proof of an undeniable romance!
 

 
If they worked together again, the buzz would be instantaneous.
 

 
After listening to his pitch, Tong Zhao replied, "You recited that very naturally."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked at her with a slightly innocent expression and replied without missing a beat, "My manager was worried I might say the wrong thing and offend you."
 

 
His answer made Tong Zhao laugh. Did people really find her that intimidating?
 

 
Jiang Dang really had the face of a villain.
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped laughing and asked, "But do you really want to make another movie with me? Or did your team send you here?"
 

 
In Tong Zhao's eyes, Jiang Dang now appeared to be the obedient, team-following good boy, almost like someone who was resigned to his fate. Of course, if his manager heard this, they’d probably feel wrongly accused... Jiang Dang, in reality, only obeyed when it suited him. When he was stubborn, he could be quite rebellious.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sensing the situation, warned, "You’re not planning on getting beaten up, are you? My next film doesn’t involve any fighting!"
 

 
She genuinely feared that Jiang Dang might say something like, "Sister, take me in."
 

 
The kind of relationship implied by that phrase in certain circles.
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang laughed, amused by her cautious tone. His eyes curved into a smile, his previously cold and ruthless expression now softened into something unexpectedly cute... How should she put it? It was like a small, smooth, and bouncy little orca had just hatched from a prickly ice egg, gazing up at her and softly saying, "I want to fall in love with you, so whenever there’s an opportunity to make a movie, I’ll come."
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned by his directness.
 

 
Just a moment ago, Jiang Dang had been so talkative while rehearsing his lines, but now, on the phone screen, he was silent. After revealing his true intentions, he stared at her intently, the silence radiating an almost overwhelming weight.
 

 
This was definitely the type who didn’t give you any idea of what he might do next...
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily dazed, her mind in turmoil.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Looks like you didn't beat him hard enough last time."
 

 
Xuyi: "Maybe you beat him too hard, and it won his heart."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Interesting, I like him. He's a little better than Wei Zekai."
 

 
Not realizing it and waiting for the girl to chase after him? That’s a bit wishful thinking.
 

 
Consort Chen added his name to her little black book, eagerly awaiting his reaction once he finally understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned.
 

 
Was she falling for him?
 

 
Her mind was in chaos, but she tried to push aside the flood of thoughts and confirm with him: "Do you like me?"
 

 
She almost wanted to say that it wasn’t professional to want to work with her just for this reason.
 

 
But then she thought about it...
 

 
His main job was as a singer; film acting was just a hobby for him. However, it turned out that his acting had been surprisingly well-received by the audience, which was why he sometimes took on roles.
 

 
One important point was that collaborating with a star you genuinely like for a romantic film was actually quite professional in the era of instinctive films. In the entertainment industry, fast-paced love stories were the mainstream. The combination of a real romance and a heartfelt movie often ended with the couple's feelings deteriorating after the shoot, as they got busy with their own schedules and chose to break up…
 

 
That was the norm in the industry.
 

 
"Yeah, I really like you."
 

 
As he said this, Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a cheerful smile.
 

 
With his stunning, almost supernatural looks, he gave off the appearance of a well-behaved and obedient child, like an innocent and gentle trap:
 

 
"After we finished our last movie, I became your fan. Do you want to be a fan of me?"
 

 
...
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fan?!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Be a person, Your Majesty!"
 

 
Tong Zhao calmed herself and replied, "I’ll consider it. I’ll send you the script first. The male lead really suits you, but using you carries a bit of risk. As for the decision, I’ll let you know once the casting results are out."
 

 
"I was just joking about being a fan," Jiang Dang said.
 

 
"I know..."
 

 
"But I really like you."
 

 
?
 

 
If Jiang Dang played FPS games, he’d probably be a great sniper.
 

 
It was too direct.
 

 
Only someone with his straightforward personality would do something like this.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was thinking about how to reject him, Jiang Dang quickly added, "You don’t need to give me an answer right now. I just wanted to express how I feel. I still want to make a movie with you, and that’s all. Nothing else."
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao politely chatted for a few more minutes, and the video call ended without any persistence or clinginess.
 

 
Jiang Dang's demeanor was like a poet encountering the sunset, composing a poem to praise the magnificent scenery that moved his soul. But is it necessary to pluck a cloud from the sky and keep it? Having seen it, liked it, and expressed it—what more is there to do?
 

 
A thousand words can only turn into a sigh...
 

 
Indeed, he was a very special person!
 

 
The casting process moved quickly. After learning that the male lead in this movie, who would act alongside Tong Zhao, had a solid character profile, nearly everyone was eager to land the role. Even though the official casting hadn’t started yet, there were already countless people trying to gather information from her and Shi Qianqiu. Xu Yiming, in particular, was tempted more than ever. Hoping for a breakthrough with this unexpected opportunity, he wasn’t about to make any promises just for short-term gain.
 

 
When the public casting began, Shi Qianqiu shared an idea with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "You know, a lot of popular and reliable young actors are hesitant to work with you because you steal the spotlight too easily."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I know."
 

 
Was Shi Qianqiu deliberately trying to provoke her?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It’s normal for love to have a power dynamic, but ‘Neverland Girl’ shouldn’t be a film where the female character completely overshadows the male. So, I have an idea…"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Can Han Zhi act?"
# Chapter104
Tong Zhao fell into a brief moment of speechlessness.
 

 
In her previous life, after suffering blows and targeted attacks, she became self-destructive and never entered the entertainment industry...
 

 
Thinking about it now, it was such a huge loss!
 

 
No wonder they are at the top of the pyramid; each one of them has a unique style and knows how to stir things up. Tong Zhao admired them, and a smile curved at the corners of her lips. She wasn't in a hurry to reply because, after all, she needed to ask Han Zhi's opinion.
 

 
Han Zhi: [I have no opinion.]
 

 
No personality would turn down anything that could help "Tong Zhao" rise to the next level.
 

 
After experiencing quick transmigration, this spirit of striving for progress had almost been etched into her soul. She wouldn’t suddenly feel discouraged or choose to give up in any world. Instead, she turned every task into a benefit, using this diverse life experience to improve herself.
 

 
[Actually, it’s quite good,]
 

 
Han Zhi thought about his fans in this world.
 

 
A ship can only have one captain. He knew he had to control his exposure and not feed his fans’ appetites too much, or it might have a negative impact on Tong Zhao herself. He and Tong Zhao were one entity—when Tong Zhao became famous, it also satisfied his own desire for fame. The only thing left was his concern for the fans.
 

 
Although Han Zhi didn’t deliberately guide them, many fans still saw him as a potential romantic partner and confessed their love to him in the live stream.
 

 
Perhaps because he wasn’t real, they didn’t fear it collapsing.
 

 
So their love was especially sincere and comforting.
 

 
Tearing rankings?
 

 
It was meaningless.
 

 
Boosting endorsement sales?
 

 
Buy what you can afford, but within reason. If any negative consequences came out of it, the company might decide to stop letting Brother Zhi stream, which would be bad.
 

 
Occasionally, someone would mention on Weibo that Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans were a breath of fresh air in the fan circle, with a heart full of one simple wish—just wanting to see their idol more.
 

 
Han Zhi felt that this had nothing to do with being a “breath of fresh air.”
 

 
In fact, the true intentions of all fangirls were not as brainless and dirty as the outside world imagined. They were simply led astray by various factors, with countless capital forces trying to make them go crazy… His girlfriend fans were indeed a “breath of fresh air,” only because his conditions were special, stripping away the superficial glamour and returning to the original essence of fanhood.
 

 
They just wanted to see him more.
 

 
And he did, too.
 

 
[I want to act.]
 

 
Han Zhi spoke.
 

 
Tong Zhao completely understood his thoughts.
 

 
Meanwhile, Shi Qianqiu was still explaining to her why he had such an explosive idea.
 

 
He had carefully watched the romantic variety show ‘Sea King Kill’ and had a high opinion of Han Zhi: “I didn’t mention similar thoughts before because he’s not suited for my kind of movie. My films focus on big-budget special effects and grand scenes, and his charm point is different from yours. He’s not really suited for such large-scale scenes…”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu further clarified that he wasn’t belittling Han Zhi.
 

 
To put it simply, when it comes to big-budget special effects and grand scenes, Tong Zhao is able to handle them well. She can charge forward with the wind, driving the audience’s emotions and getting them excited for the story’s climax.
 

 
Han Zhi is a different type. He is like a gentle, melancholic vortex—no matter how raging the flood is, he remains like a trap independent from the chaos, making people unconsciously ignore the grand scenes and focus on him, concerned about his emotions.
 

 
Looking at it from another perspective…
 

 
Isn’t this exactly the kind of talent needed for a romance film?
 

 
If the director uses him, there’s no need to worry about the audience not getting into the story.
 

 
It’s not a problem at all.
 

 
The more Shi Qianqiu thought about it, the more he felt that this was exactly the case.
 

 
He almost couldn’t wait to pull Tong Zhao over and push her into the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
The only drawback was that it might reinforce the stereotype that "Tong Zhao can’t work with other male stars"…
 

 
Shi Qianqiu honestly shared this concern with Tong Zhao, leaving her to decide for herself.
 

 
Without hesitation, Tong Zhao replied: “Then let’s book Han Zhi.”
 

 
Let the next movie solve the stereotype left by this one!
 

 
Seeing how quickly she made her decision, Shi Qianqiu no longer lingered on the downside. He eagerly started thinking about the benefits of using Han Zhi. At the very least, the publicity would be easy, as the topic was already hot. The only problem would be the roadshow, but they could try shifting the focus to variety shows and having him appear as a guest.
 

 
The benefits of controlling Han Zhi's exposure had already shown themselves.
 

 
At least his fans and netizens hadn’t grown tired of him yet. The company hadn’t seized this opportunity to over-saturate the market and exploit his popularity.
 

 
Those who stick to their principles end up with the best results in the end.
 

 
...
 

 
The news that Tong Zhao would be filming a new movie quickly spread.
 

 
At first, the industry buzzed with curiosity about the script she had chosen.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had turned down many good script offers recently. She was clearly aiming for something even better. What kind of amazing script could stand out and attract the attention of the box-office queen? This wasn’t a secret; Xu Yiming was building a team under Tong Zhao’s name. Of course, he wouldn’t easily show them the full script, but keeping it under wraps was hard…
 

 
After all, setting up a venue requires renting codes.
 

 
In just two days, the industry knew that Tong Zhao was filming a romance movie set in a luxurious mansion estate.
 

 
However, many people thought that the "romance film" was just a smokescreen.
 

 
They had their reasons, explained with confidence and backed by logic: "Can a romance brain really move Tong Zhao? Don’t think so, it’s definitely a mansion mystery murder case!"
 

 
"If you ask me, it should be a battle for a wealthy family’s inheritance."
 

 
"The possibility of suspense is very high. I think she’s played too many positive roles. Maybe she wants to try a more sinister protagonist. How about a serial killer who kidnaps victims and brings them to a mansion? I want to see her play a sexy Black Widow-style character." This was the opinion of a film critic who was obsessed with imperial assassins, hoping to see Tong Zhao once again play a ruthless character who kills as easily as slicing through vegetables.
 

 
Their analysis was thorough.
 

 
But no matter how reasonable their analysis was, it didn’t matter. Fans and critics were different—fans just wanted to indulge in sweet moments and see more beautiful looks.
 

 
In short, they wanted some sweetness and a beautiful big sister.
 

 
Such simple and unpretentious demands led to a flurry of half-true and half-false rumors and discussions on anonymous entertainment forums:
 

 
"I heard that TZ turned down three scripts this month. What role is she playing in her next movie?"
 

 
"Inside info: TZ’s next movie will reunite her with a certain villain."
 

 
"Groundhog scream! I haven’t seen my steamed bun in a while, where has she gone? Wuwuwu."
 

 
"Stop the waves, TZ’s retiring and getting married."
 

 
...
 

 
The increasing level of absurdity in the rumors showed just how desperate netizens were for information about Tong Zhao’s current status. Fans and insiders were especially sensitive. After all, Tong Zhao had always been known for her career-driven image. She usually didn’t stay idle, with variety shows often filling the gaps between movies. But after ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wrapped up, she had only shown up at the celebration party and had otherwise seemed to disappear.
 

 
The all-powerful paparazzi couldn’t catch a glimpse of her.
 

 
Celebrities who had worked with her were asked about her and became more relaxed with their words: "Tong Zhao? She went out for a walk during the roadshow, couldn’t find her on the street, so save time and do something meaningful."
 

 
Thanks to the efforts of her team, netizens subconsciously received a message:
 

 
Tong Zhao was reducing her exposure, which meant she was starting to raise her profile.
 

 
Capital seeks profit, and as long as Tong Zhao could still carry box office numbers, she remained the darling of investors. But it was clear that Tong Zhao had higher ambitions and wasn’t satisfied with her current position. While her peers were still fighting for exposure and traffic, she had already moved to a different level. Industry insiders said that Shi Dingjun was planning to push for awards for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, and the lead actor might win their first major award since debut...
 

 
It was subtle, but it hinted that Tong Zhao’s team had begun to pursue awards.
 

 
Fans were both happy and disappointed.
 

 
Happy that their sister’s career was moving to the next level.
 

 
Disappointed that they still wanted to see more of Tong Zhao’s work.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao would occasionally livestream to play games, but under the company’s suggestion, her livestreams were indefinitely suspended. The result was that the best opportunity to see Tong Zhao was now in "Han Zhi’s" weekly two-hour holographic livestream. However, in order to create a sense of detachment from reality, Han Zhi rarely mentioned Tong Zhao. When asked in the live comments, he generally wouldn’t respond, and when he did, his answers were mostly distant, like "I’m not sure.”
 

 
How could it not be clear if it’s the same person?
 

 
So, whenever a fan of Tong Zhao carelessly asked similar questions, veteran viewers would explain the rules of the livestream.
 

 
Twenty minutes before the broadcast started today, a typical Tong Zhao fan, someone who had been following her for a long time, barged in.
 

 
[Stop asking, if you want to know Tong Zhao’s schedule, better ask Sister Chu.]
 

 
[Just focus on watching Brother Zhi, okay?]
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan quickly realized and politely apologized to their fellow fans.
 

 
The veteran viewers, understanding that Tong Zhao had been reducing her appearances lately and that her fans were eager for information, didn’t scold the fan.
 

 
Then, they waited. Finally, Han Zhi appeared.
 

 
The livestream screen lit up, revealing a luxurious apartment with minimalist decor (as Tong Zhao’s value increased, the company provided her with more upscale holographic livestream codes, indirectly giving Han Zhi’s fans a sense of "the idol is alive and growing"), and a fully outfitted man entered.
 

 
It was winter in reality, so everyone outside was bundled up, and Han Zhi was no exception.
 

 
He wore a black hat and mask, only revealing a pair of deep, melancholic eyes and a beautifully sculpted nose.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly removed his hat, turned his head, and his ears were flushed red.
 

 
When he took off his mask, his nose, slightly reddened from the cold, took a little bit away from his perfect image but instead made him appear more down-to-earth and approachable. The comment section was full of welcoming messages like "Welcome home, Brother," and some even called him "husband." If you didn’t know better, you’d think Han Zhi had a whole room of wives.
 

 
According to the system settings, the comments would appear in Han Zhi's line of sight as a projection, making it easy for him to see them at any time.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at the comments and, unable to suppress a warm smile, said:
 

 
"Yeah, I’m back."
 

 
[Ahhh, Brother, I missed you so much, can you stream a bit longer today?]
 

 
[Just now, a fan of Sister Zhao came in, but we didn’t scold him, we kindly explained the rules of the livestream!]
 

 
There were even some fans who wanted credit.
 

 
After removing his full disguise, Han Zhi sat down on the sofa in front of the camera, his face showing an indescribable fatigue, as if he had been on a long journey to some faraway place that fans didn’t know about, looking dusty and weary.
 

 
Where had he been?
 

 
No one knew, and that mystery was captivating.
 

 
The handsome young man visibly looked a bit tired, but his gaze remained focused as he read every line of the comments, then slowly and clearly praised them: "Well done, while I wasn’t here, you all behaved very well."
 

 
The comment section exploded with exclamations of joy, as if their hearts were hit by a wave of warmth.
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan who had stayed was a straight guy, indifferent to Han Zhi, and had been informed by other fans that Brother Zhi wouldn’t respond to any questions about Tong Zhao. He was about to leave when he saw Han Zhi call out his name: "She’s preparing for new work recently. I’ve been busy too, looks like I’m a bit tired, huh? But I’m still happy to see you all."
 

 
Many guys, after a whole day of work, will casually say "baby, I love you" to their girlfriends, just wanting to go to bed as soon as possible.
 

 
It’s true they’re tired and want to sleep, but the sincerity of "I love you" matters. The girlfriend can feel it… Saying "I love you" just to avoid being bothered by her is more hurtful than saying nothing at all. A woman might wonder when love words turned into a tool to make her stop bothering him, rather than coming from the heart?
 

 
But Han Zhi had the ability to make tens of thousands of girls believe that what he said was true.
 

 
They believed he was genuinely busy, and when he saw them, he was really happy.
 

 
Many girls in Han Zhi’s fanbase are not conventionally attractive. During his peak popularity, malicious comments were saying that girls who follow idols are generally unattractive and unloved, and those who follow virtual idols are even worse—like the upgraded version of the tank. These words are filled with stereotypes, and individuals in any fanbase indeed vary in appearance, and beauty should not be defined by weight.
 

 
However, hearing such things still hurts.
 

 
In Han Zhi’s livestream, he doesn’t say exaggerated, hollow words. Instead, in the small, subtle interactions, you can feel his love and gentleness toward every fan…
 

 
He’s not in a rush to prove anything; both the fans and he can take their time.
 

 
Confidence is built slowly.
 

 
Fans who are loved by him can't be swayed by the malicious slanders of trolls.
 

 
– “Brother says I’m good and cute, but the trolls say I’m not, who are they to talk? Get lost, trolls!”
 

 
[What’s Brother up to?]
 

 
[I thought Brother was on vacation.]
 

 
“I’m not on vacation. The company gave me some work, so I might get busier soon.”
 

 
[Oh? Is Tong Zhao taking a new movie? Or a variety show? A TV drama?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans assumed that when Brother said he was getting busier, it meant Tong Zhao had new resources lined up.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s exhaustion would affect Han Zhi.
 

 
But this was purely the fans’ imagination. After her cultivation, Tong Zhao was so healthy she could fight ten people at once. Even when the entire production crew was exhausted, she was still full of energy. Her Brother Zhi might look tired, but that was just his personal style—a man who could always pull a pretty girl into his arms and fall asleep together.
 

 
“Can’t say.”
 

 
During the livestream, Han Zhi subtly dropped a big piece of news, and soon, the fact that Tong Zhao was considering taking a new film spread.
 

 
This was part of Tong Zhao’s team’s plan.
 

 
Fans didn’t expect the male lead to be Han Zhi, and assumed that it was simply about Tong Zhao taking a new project.
 

 
The news gradually started to spread in the industry…
 

 
It’s confirmed to be a romance movie!
 

 
So, who is the male lead?
 

 
Fans turned their attention to male stars who had recently cleared their schedules and had the right star power.
 

 
However, some fans who were more knowledgeable about the entertainment industry analyzed that Tong Zhao might cast a newcomer, as established male stars might be reluctant to work with her, fearing they’d be overshadowed by her. “Acting with Tong Zhao” might not be as appealing as they imagined.
 

 
In any case, the least credible rumor about her retiring and getting married was quickly debunked.
 

 
Manager Chu subtly mentioned on Weibo that it was a very traditional romance movie, with no monsters to fight, and that the male lead would be someone no one expected.
 

 
Someone with good intentions shared this with Jiang Dang.
 

 
He was quite disappointed: [Then I have no hope.]
 

 
Friends eating melon: [?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: [Netizens all think that I’m meant to be with Tong Zhao. Since the male lead is someone no one expects, then it definitely isn’t me.]
 

 
The friends and family were at a loss for words for a moment.
 

 
It can't be said to be completely fabricated, but rather, it was something made up out of thin air.
 

 
After analyzing it from every angle, they finally concluded that the male lead for Tong Zhao's project must be a new face that no one has seen before!
# Chapter105
The crew arrived so quickly, like a tornado.
 

 
The crew for ‘Neverland Girl’ quickly came together, and Xu Yiming thought he was dreaming—ever since the director was confirmed to be Shi Qianqiu, he had felt a bit helpless. His attitude toward the two towering figures was full of respect and fear. This was obviously not good for a producer. Fortunately, midway through, Shi Qianqiu deliberately gave him a lot of power, letting him handle things as long as they got done right. It was only then that Xu Yiming evolved from being a sycophant back into a human being.
 

 
Tong Zhao said she didn’t expect him to be so good at managing people.
 

 
Could it be that he had the face of a stepmother but the heart of a real mother?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “What kind of people can you hire with a 40 million budget? It’s still about finding the right foreman that fits the spending level.”
 

 
…
 

 
Sigh, she had overestimated him.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly changed his WeChat note to "Versailles Director."
 

 
So Versailles, yet so annoying.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “By the way, a group of people wants to come for the audition for the lead actress’s parents. Do you want to supervise?”
 

 
They were from the same city.
 

 
But they were both so busy, their schedules never aligned, so they had never had a chance to hang out.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how her career had been smooth sailing since her rebirth, and she hadn’t experienced many auditions. She had only tried out for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ twice and hadn’t seen anyone else audition. Since she was considering upgrading from a piece on the chessboard to the player, understanding the filmmaking process was essential. After confirming the audition date, she squeezed out time from her schedule: “I can come.”
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
Once it was decided, Shi Qianqiu promptly hung up the phone.
 

 
…
 

 
The audition was set for 2:00 PM.
 

 
To save costs, the audition would take place in a relatively simple setting, and the scene would be very short, aiming to assess the actor's compatibility with the role in the briefest possible segment. Tong Zhao had a spa session in the morning, arriving 15 minutes early at the audition location in the afternoon.
 

 
The heating in the minivan was set high, and after walking through the cold air of the parking lot, she entered the warm movie studio building. The alternating hot and cold air made her eyes feel dry, and she regretted not wearing sunglasses.
 

 
She found the audition room and opened the door, just in time to see Shi Qianqiu giving instructions.
 

 
“Xiao Zhao!”
 

 
A worker recognized Tong Zhao and enthusiastically greeted her.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu heard the voice and turned around. As their gazes met, Tong Zhao saw a look of surprise on his gentle, scholarly face. He walked over, looking at her curiously: "Who made you cry?"
 

 
"How can you tell I cried?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu motioned for her to look at the mirror hanging nearby, meant for actors to check their makeup.
 

 
The round mirror reflected her moist, reddened eyes, as if there were traces of tears.
 

 
"Cold and hot air, it irritated my eyes," Tong Zhao explained nonchalantly. "Is everyone here?"
 

 
"They're here. We're just testing the equipment. Do you want to look at the script?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
Because the cost of renting the luxurious mansion for the actual film was too expensive, the audition’s budget would exceed, so Xu Yiming rented another residential location code for the audition background. This savvy cost-saving move impressed Shi Qianqiu, who jokingly referred to him as the "King of Thrift" in their WeChat group.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: Is this considered bullying on the set?
 

 
However, Xu Yiming was thrilled to be praised by his idol and quickly changed his group nickname to "King of Thrift Xu Yiming."
 

 
... The thoughts of a sycophant—humans just don’t understand.
 

 
Now, back to the present.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the paper script.
 

 
The story in the script takes place in a plain, ordinary apartment, with three characters: an elderly couple and their daughter, who returns to her parents’ home after suffering from domestic violence.
 

 
The script was only two thin pages, with few lines, but the scenes were full of tension, and the opening was a conflict.
 

 
Audition Script
 

 
Time: 6:00 PM
 
Location: Apartment #01341, Residential Type
 
Characters:
 
- Father Nie
 
- Mother Nie
 
- Nie Siyan
 

 
Mother Nie is cooking dinner while Father Nie sits at the dining table reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings, and Mother Nie quickly puts down the ladle and rushes to open the door. She finds her daughter, who has returned from her marriage. Her daughter looks exhausted, wearing a thick scarf that doesn't match the current season's temperature (to hide the bruises on her neck).
 

 
Mother Nie asks her why she's home so late and where Lu Junsheng is.
 

 
Nie Siyan awkwardly says that she missed home.
 

 
The beef brisket with potatoes has just finished simmering, and Mother Nie invites her daughter to sit down and eat while they ask about her life. After a brief moment of restraint, Nie Siyan confesses the truth of the domestic violence she has been enduring.
 

 
At first, her parents don't believe her until she shows them evidence of the bruises.
 

 
---
 

 
The audition script for ‘Neverland Girl’ is structured to set the scene, observing how actors instinctively choose their responses, which the director and crew then assess for suitability. The team behind ‘Neverland Girl’ is relatively simple, primarily made up of Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao.
 

 
More than twenty people are waiting for auditions, with the queue ordered by fame and price. Once a satisfactory candidate is found, the remaining auditioners don’t need to proceed, keeping costs at a minimum. This is Tong Zhao's first time seeing such an organized audition process, and she's a bit excited.
 

 
The fact that Tong Zhao is supervising the audition is kept a secret from the auditioners—this is a confidential trip.
 

 
The staff is busy, and a helper gently asks if Sister Xiao needs anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao shakes her head.
 

 
Just before the auditions begin, Shi Qianqiu mysteriously brings over a large cup of honey water and snacks.
 

 
Chips, popcorn, milk candy, sweet potato fries—both salty and sweet options are available.
 

 
Like many people, when she's not truly hungry or thirsty, Tong Zhao wouldn't usually bother asking for food. But when it's brought to her, it’s a different story. She accepts the warm honey water and a basket of sweet potato fries, and when she sees a large tub of popcorn, she can't help but laugh: "Are you watching a movie or having a snack?"
 

 
"You're not wrong," Shi Qianqiu replies as he sits beside her. The large screen in the audition room lights up.
 

 
Unlike typical holographic filming setups, the screen for each auditionee shows their name and number above their head, which gives off a bit of a video game character vibe. The first pair to audition are Chen Feilan and Su Qihua, two regulars who often play supporting roles in family dramas. They're known for their strong, dominant on-screen personalities, and they're featured in more than half of the family-oriented, frustrating dramas in the market.
 

 
Their collaboration in family dramas is often so realistic that audiences will jokingly wonder, "When did they install cameras in my hometown?" They usually don’t need a pre-written script to deliver down-to-earth performances, like forcing someone to attend a blind date or using tricks to get them married—it’s all second nature to them.
 

 
Replacing Tong Zhao in the role of the daughter is a temporary actress with a more docile subconscious.
 

 
The purpose of the audition is to see how well the actors fit the role, allowing them to perform freely. Tong Zhao had considered stepping in herself, but Shi Qianqiu stopped her. He said he didn’t want to risk an unexpected mishap, and that if things didn’t go smoothly, they would have to shoot multiple takes. He had prepared two temporary actresses, so there was no need to put her through that.
 

 
The first audition begins.
 

 
Chen Feilan is cooking, while Su Qihua is reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings…
 

 
The opening scene is no problem.
 

 
"Why are you back at this hour? Where’s Junsheng?"
 

 
"He... he’s busy. I don’t know about him, I just missed you, missed home."
 

 
"Come on in, if you miss home, you should come back and have a meal with Junsheng. Mom doesn't mind cooking for one more person."
 

 
A pot of beef brisket with potatoes is placed in the center of the dining table.
 

 
Chen Feilan continued to express her concern, one sentence after another, her words thick with maternal love and worry, each sentence pressing her daughter’s head lower and lower, until she couldn't lift it anymore.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was making notes on his iPad.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the screen: [Satisfying the suppression disguised as love.]
 

 
The daughter nervously explained why she had returned so suddenly, and then, with a hint of crying in her voice, continued: "Mom, he hits me every day, I can't live like this anymore..."
 

 
"He hits you? How is that possible?"
 

 
In the script's setup, the son-in-law is a clean-cut, handsome white-collar worker. He doesn’t look at all like the type of person they imagined would be capable of beating his wife.
 

 
Faced with her parents' disbelief, the daughter had no choice but to roll up her sleeves to prove it.
 

 
This is where the plot takes a turn.
 

 
Su Qihua frowned, accusing his daughter of surely doing something wrong to anger the son-in-law: "You keep running back to your parents’ house to seek justice; all that does is drive a wedge between the couple. So now you’ve just come back here, what do you think your in-laws will say about you?" Chen Feilan covered her face and cried, feeling sorry for her daughter’s misfortune. She stopped her husband from saying more: "Wait, I'll go with you to apologize and buy some gifts to talk things over with your in-laws."
 

 
After a long lecture, the daughter remained silent, her eyes filled with despair.
 

 
Chen Feilan pulled her sleeve back to cover the bruises on her arms, worried about what the neighbors would say if they saw.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao furrowed her brow: "They are more suited for TV dramas."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu agreed: "They can't capture that feeling of indulgence."
 

 
The two exchanged their thoughts on the characters quietly.
 

 
"The parents' original intention of sheltering their daughter was to protect her, afraid she might end up like the older daughter, who died unexpectedly. Even though their love may have unintentionally turned into overprotection, the focus should be on their excessive care for the daughter. Their subconscious can indeed bring out strong conflict in a short amount of time, but it's not the effect I'm looking for," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"Yes, I also want this film to be more romantic and beautiful, not a family drama with trivial matters," Shi Qianqiu agreed.
 

 
"However, with their performance, the part where the daughter argues with her parents for her personal autonomy will definitely be very interesting," he added.
 

 
"Let's see how others perform."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
The second pair of auditionees wanted to take the daughter to the police but hesitated when the daughter blocked them. The family sat together, their faces full of sorrow and tension, staring at the beef brisket with potatoes.
 

 
The third pair, even after seeing the daughter’s injuries, still refused to believe she had been abused. They preferred to believe in their good memories of the son-in-law. He was such a gentle scholar; how could he possibly hit a woman?
 

 
After watching these three pairs, Tong Zhao's eyes were opened.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was patient, showing no sign of impatience. As usual, he asked the staff about the auditionees' details. Since the auditions were ordered by fame, by the fourth pair, the names started to become unfamiliar—names Tong Zhao had never seen before.
 

 
When the screen lit up again, both of them straightened up, ready to observe.
 

 
The previous scene had smoothly progressed with the daughter revealing the cruel treatment she suffered at her in-laws' home.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, "I already know the next line — 'Really? How could that be? Did he just push you, and you overreacted?'"
 

 
Tong Zhao placed a handful of chips on his bucket of popcorn: "Food can't shut your mouth."
 

 
The monitoring screen showed the parents' faces turning pale.
 

 
The actress playing the mother trembled as she gently stroked her daughter's bruises, silent tears flowing down her face as she embraced her, patting her back to comfort her. The actress playing the daughter had already entered the same scene four times, numb and unaware, her sadness and pain frozen into a mask on her face.
 

 
And this mask shattered and melted in the mother's embrace.
 

 
"Nan Nan, don’t go back. Stay here with us, okay?"
 

 
"But..."
 

 
When the parents proactively suggested not returning to that house, the daughter hesitated. The mother then gently coaxed her, using a half-persuading, half-soothing tone. The daughter looked towards her father, who nodded, "Listen to your mother."
 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu didn't stop them early, allowing the three of them to continue for a little while. He then guided the daughter to ask specific questions: "If I divorce Junsheng, I won't have anywhere to live..."
 

 
"How could you not have anywhere to live? You can stay at home, sleep with mom. You used to sleep between us when you were little."
 

 
"I'm older now. It's hard to find a partner for a second marriage."
 

 
The mother embraced her from behind: "If you don't marry, you'll live with me for the rest of your life."
 

 
---
 

 
When the two extra actors stepped out of the holographic filming booth, Shi Qianqiu's assistant approached to inform them that they had been selected to play the parents of the female lead. They were overjoyed.
 

 
The older generation, having grown up in the traditional film era, generally resisted instinct-based films, always thinking that such high-tech equipment must be highly radioactive. So, aside from regular supporting actors, most people auditioning at the film studio were those who were struggling financially and seeking extra work.
 

 
These two extra actors were no exception.
 

 
Zhang Siliang, chosen to play the mother of the female lead, was a single mother, waiting to use her pay to help support her married son. She beamed with happiness and thanked the assistant repeatedly.
 

 
"Why are you thanking me? It was Director Shi's decision," the assistant laughed, seeing the two extras look both thrilled and nervous, afraid they might not perform well in such an important role. The assistant comforted them, "Don’t worry, not only is Director Shi here today, but Xiao Zhao is here too. Both of them think you’re perfect for the role, so just relax and wait for the shoot!"
 

 
Meanwhile, the other auditionees had already moved on to their next auditions, with only the first pair still waiting for notification.
 

 
Chen Feilan and Su Qihua had observed the other contestants before their audition and felt confident they would secure the role, but instead, they waited and waited, only to lose out unexpectedly.
 

 
"How unlucky," Chen Feilan muttered. "Didn't you say you were close to Director Shi?"
 

 
Su Qihua, caught off guard, felt a little guilty. His relationship with Shi Qianqiu was limited to occasionally running into him at the local film studio. He explained, "Didn't you hear? The lead actress is here today too. If she doesn’t like us, what can Director Shi do?"
 

 
"Really lacking vision."
 

 
Chen Feilan took his words seriously, and her opinion of Tong Zhao dropped.
 

 
The strict, controlling parents—he thought they had played better roles than this. Were they really rejecting them just because they were too expensive? Chen Feilan really wanted to indulge her passion for acting in a film, so she placed the blame on Tong Zhao...
 

 
On the other side, after accompanying the other roles through their auditions, Tong Zhao was called over by Shi Qianqiu: "Do you have any plans next?"
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
"I'm hungry. How about we grab a meal on the way? You said you’d treat me last time, but we never had the chance."
 

 
The "last time" referred to when they were filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Tong Zhao's schedule for the evening was indeed free, and the experience of watching the audition together had been light and enjoyable. After a brief thought, she agreed, telling her assistant not to worry about giving her a ride back, as she would just take Shi Qianqiu's car.
 

 
The assistant obediently left in the shuttle car to finish their day early.
 

 
Five minutes later, Tong Zhao stood beside Shi Qianqiu's fluorescent green sports car, suddenly feeling the urge to call the driver to bring the shuttle car back.
# Chapter106
“If you don’t like this one, there are others.”
 

 
There are two types of parking spaces in the film studio.
 

 
One is the public parking space.
 

 
Although it’s called public, it’s actually only open to guests with reservations. So, actors or extras who don’t have contracts or weren’t invited by the studio can only take public transportation or park in nearby lots and walk to the studio.
 

 
The other type is private parking spaces, usually bought by major entertainment companies for their own artists when they come to shoot films or TV shows.
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu led Tong Zhao to another understated black Bentley. Seeing Tong Zhao clearly relax, he smiled lightly with his thin lips: “All the cars at home are black. I’ve gotten a little tired of them, so when I bought a car, I wanted something more colorful.”
 

 
Fluorescent green is too colorful.
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly recalled that Shi Qianqiu’s family seemed to be involved in some gray industries. Then, thinking about "All the cars at home are black"… Ah, so this is the image of an underworld heir that comes to mind. Shi Qianqiu opened the car door for her, and after seeing her expression, even though she hadn’t spoken, he smoothly caught her train of thought: “Yes, I’m the heir of the Shi family who has been wandering outside. Last time I went home, the two rows of cars filled up the entire street, and two lines of men in black suits bowed to welcome the return of the Shura heir.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
After getting into the car, Tong Zhao rolled her eyes at him without any lady-like restraint: “I just thought that your taste in cars should have a lot in common with my childhood friend.”
 

 
To her surprise, Shi Qianqiu even mentioned a familiar name: “Wei Zekai?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t expect him to guess so accurately and was slightly surprised.
 

 
“He’s very simple.”
 

 
“You’re so protective of him, so is the gossip true?” Shi Qianqiu smirked and sat in the driver’s seat.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled up her mask, trying to hide her small face behind it.
 

 
“That tone of yours... I think I’ve seen it somewhere before.”
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu shook his smartwatch, making a few quick adjustments. He then selected the scene he wanted from the massive film library. The small smartwatch was incredibly powerful, directly connecting to the car's sound system. Soon, a dramatic, melodramatic audio clip began to play, with immersive surround sound:
 

 
[Tell me, who is that woman to you?]
 

 
The plain-dressed wife clutched her husband, who was about to leave, and tearfully asked.
 

 
“I don’t even know who you’re talking about.”
 

 
“Don’t lie to me,” the wife sneered, “That new assistant at your company, Mary, just graduated from college, right? She’s so young but already knows how to seduce other people's husbands. How could you do that?”
 

 
Hearing the name Mary, the husband frowned and pulled her hand away: "I don't know what you're talking about. Don't go crazy just because you heard there's a new female classmate at my company."
 

 
"Well, if you're not going to admit it, I even have her phone number and address. Do you want me to take the records of your hotel stays and chats and ask her family about it?"
 

 
When the wife mentioned confronting the mistress, the husband finally couldn't hold it in any longer and his face changed. He shouted at her: "You're crazy! She's not like you, she's very innocent. I need to protect her. Listen, what happens behind closed doors is our business. Do you want to make it so everyone loses face? Is that what will make you happy?!"
 

 
This was a real shout.
 

 
Tong Zhao could only regret that the mask she pulled up couldn't cover her ears.
 

 
"You really find the clips fast. Is it true that if there's a number, you can find any resources?"
 

 
Tong Zhao made a sarcastic remark.
 

 
"Apologies,"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shook his wrist again, and the picture and sound disappeared simultaneously. "It's a professional habit. When I'm not filming, I absorb a lot of information. I’ve watched almost every instinctive movie on the market, including some bad ones. Sometimes, I think they’re bad, but in a creative way."
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything.
 

 
Although she didn’t speak, Shi Qianqiu continued, almost as if reading her mind: "I used to use this trick often when I was dating. No matter the scene, I could pull out the perfect classic romantic lines for the mood... I'm a screenwriter and director, right? So, let the movie speak my romantic lines for me."
 

 
That was quite a move.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Learned something.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You’re not right.]
 

 
"It is quite romantic," Tong Zhao acknowledged, but then became a little curious, "What happened next?"
 

 
"There was no ‘next.’ I'm not in a relationship right now," Shi Qianqiu's black Bentley quietly merged into the flow of traffic. In the rearview mirror, his faint smile reflected, but his eyes had a cold undertone: "I don't think you would be moved by this... If I were your boyfriend and I did this, what would your reaction be?"
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned her chin on her hand, staring out at the scenery passing by quickly, and absentmindedly responded:
 

 
"Me? I’d probably say, 'Don’t talk about work on a date, and if you love me, just say it to my face.'"
 

 
When she said the word "love," her expression softened. The light outside the window illuminated her bright almond-shaped eyes, creating a crescent-shaped glow. It was so beautiful that Shi Qianqiu, in the rearview mirror, couldn’t help but want to take a picture of her. He was eager to do so.
 

 
So, Shi Qianqiu’s thoughts shifted to the topic of filmmaking:
 

 
"By the way, how did you come to choose this script? The script itself is good, but there must be something particularly appealing to you about it."
 

 
Talking about work, Tong Zhao became more animated.
 

 
Although she didn’t know where they were going for dinner, and the drive seemed to be quite long, the two of them kept chatting nonstop about the topic of ‘Neverland Girl’. Before long, they had arrived at the place where Shi Qianqiu had planned to take her for dinner.
 

 
It was a quiet Japanese restaurant located in the middle of the hustle and bustle, operating on a reservation system. The two of them sat down in front of the sushi chef, and soon enough, they didn’t see any other diners—Tong Zhao guessed that they only took one group of customers per time slot.
 

 
This Japanese restaurant seemed to specialize in various types of alcohol. The wooden shelves were lined with a dazzling array of bottles, and even the wine glasses were quite refined. Each dish was paired with a different type of alcohol, served in small sips that didn’t leave a strong alcoholic aftertaste. As soon as Tong Zhao tasted it, she realized that the intention wasn’t to get her drunk.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and teased, “You’ve served me a lot to drink, but it’s not strong enough to get me drunk.”
 

 
“Why would you want to get drunk?” Shi Qianqiu refilled her glass, but only poured a small amount. “I’m not worried about the cost of the alcohol, but if someone gets drunk, how are they supposed to have a decent conversation?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu once again defied her impression of him.
 

 
At private gatherings, he wasn’t the carefree, artsy youth she had expected. Instead, he was capable of making in-depth discussions about the film industry, offering fresh and clear insights:
 

 
"My movies always do well at the box office. What's the secret to success? To put it simply, I know what the audience wants to see. The arrival of instinctive movies has changed the audience, and interestingly, the audience has adapted to the changes of the times faster than many filmmakers. While some directors are still stuck debating how to refine the script and control the plot, the story starts to become too conservative and boring… Isn’t it funny to try and make traditional movies with the techniques used to capture the subconscious?"
 

 
"You’re going to become a big hit, and one of the reasons is that your subconscious is perfectly suited for the kind of problem instinctive movies address."
 

 
"The variety of your subconscious is something I’ve never seen before in all my years as a director."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had a good tolerance for alcohol, but he still drank more than Tong Zhao.
 

 
With the effects of the alcohol, his gaze softened. His eyes narrowed into a gentle smile as he looked at Tong Zhao, and his tone suddenly became softer: "They say your subconscious is unstable and not suitable for instinctive films, but I don’t agree. And I’m a successful director, much more successful than those who say such things..."
 

 
He paused.
 

 
There was much more he wanted to say.
 

 
For example, the reason Shi Qianqiu wanted "Han Zhi" to play the male lead wasn’t just because he recognized that this aspect of her subconscious was indeed well-suited for the role, but also because he wanted to uncover more of the charming sides of Tong Zhao’s subconscious—why, just because her subconscious was different, did they say she wasn’t suitable? He didn’t believe it.
 

 
However, when these words were spoken, they felt a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Passersby and fans who didn’t know the truth might think this was a sweet conversation between a domineering director and his favored star.
 

 
But that wasn’t the case.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu just really wanted to work with the instinctive actor he had his eye on and slap all the naysayers in the face.
 

 
...
 

 
The dinner went very smoothly.
 

 
As the two of them took the elevator downstairs, Tong Zhao’s lips, hidden behind her mask, curved into a pleasant smile.
 

 
When the elevator doors opened, Tong Zhao was about to say something, but just as the words were on the tip of her tongue, the sound of a camera shutter interrupted her. Tong Zhao quickly turned her head, her almond-shaped eyes narrowing sharply as she focused on the source of the sound.
 

 
The paparazzi didn’t expect her to react so quickly.
 

 
But so what?
 

 
The target had seen the camera, and the entertainment reporters were thrilled to capture the shot. Tong Zhao made a quick decision in that instant—her gaze became indifferent as she turned away, walking toward Shi Qianqiu’s car. She didn’t care how the paparazzi got her whereabouts, as it was impossible to guard against everything, unless she locked herself inside her house 24/7...
 

 
#Tong Zhao Secretly Meets Director Shi#
 

 
#Tong Zhao’s Relationship Exposed#
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, nearly as soon as she got home, the trending topics followed right behind her. It seemed like the paparazzi couldn’t wait to sell the photos. Tong Zhao had already given Chu Jie a heads-up, and PR had decided not to buy the batch of photos. They just treated it as movie publicity. The gossip was easy to explain—movie collaboration, she went to the audition in the afternoon, then grabbed a bite afterward. What was so strange about that?
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming rumors, Tong Zhao sipped a cup of hot tea to calm her nerves and sober up.
 

 
This time, she was much more calm on WeChat.
 

 
It seemed her friends had learned to tell the difference between fake and real news—especially the partners from Zeshan Ventures, who were particularly unfazed. They watched Wei Zekai worry and, one by one, calmly continued chatting, with one person even posting "99" on the screen.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her phone to check and immediately laughed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Aren't you guys worried???]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The wild man is going to steal Tong Zhao!!!]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Give it up, if Sister Zhao wasn't single, she would definitely tell us.]
 

 
Second Generation B: [He’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out.]
 

 
Second Generation C: [No one would really be triggered by just a few photos, right? No way, right?]
 

 
No one understood Wei Zekai. He was frustrated.
 

 
Wei Zekai angrily sent an emoji of a punch:
 

 
[You don’t understand, Shi Qianqiu is no simple character. I’m worried that Tong Zhao is too naive and might get tricked.]
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao saw this message, she momentarily lost focus and thought about the melodramatic TV drama that Shi Qianqiu had played for her. The other partners from Zeshan Ventures weren’t swayed by his words. After all, no matter how you looked at it, it was only Sister Zhao who was playing someone else. She was too naive to get tricked? Uh...
 

 
It was probably only Wei Zekai who thought that way.
# Chapter107
This relationship is a bit twisted, really. Wei Zekai doesn't know Shi Qianqiu personally. What he knows is Shi Qianqiu's younger brother, Shi Wandong, who has always obediently followed the family's plan, shouldering the responsibility of inheriting the family business. For years, he has diligently managed the group, ensuring his older brother could lavishly spend his earnings in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai doesn’t have many friends, but it turns out he has one she didn’t know about.
 

 
The reason he doesn’t have many friends is that he has a sharp tongue and is picky about people. Additionally, the aura of the eldest son of the Wei family is always intimidating. However, once you become his friend, you’ll realize that behind this "intimidating" exterior, the truth is that he’s "easy to handle"...
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Wandong is a good person, just busy, so we never had the chance to hang out together.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I told him before, everyone thinks I’m unreliable, but only he and you think I’m good. Why do you think that is? He said that growing up with his older brother made him see everyone as more reliable than his brother. But Wandong is a bit of a "brother's boy"—he complains, but still works tirelessly. Every time Shi Qianqiu has a new film release, he always organizes employees to go watch it, paying for the tickets himself.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao listened to him, she began searching online.
 

 
What popped up about Shi Wandong was an elite figure who resembled Shi Qianqiu by about seventy to eighty percent. He wore a suit and gold-rimmed glasses, looking like a reliable good boy—though he looked a little older, he didn’t resemble Shi Qianqiu’s younger brother at all. In fact, he looked more like Shi Qianqiu’s older brother. Tong Zhao clicked through a couple more pages and even stumbled upon some fanfiction about the two of them in a "bone-crushing" (medical) couple pairing... What the heck! Tong Zhao, who couldn’t stomach the "real" couple pairing, quickly covered her face and exited the page, desperately clicking the "X" to protect her eyes.
 

 
Wei Zekai rambled on, providing examples of Shi Qianqiu being "no saint."
 

 
For instance, he once tricked his younger brother into doing his summer homework by claiming it was to "prepare for higher-level courses." For a whole year, Shi Wandong did all his homework for him, only to be caught by their mother, which finally put an end to it. This kind of brotherly betrayal actually managed to fool Shi Wandong into thinking it was a "warm" memory of his older brother being overly considerate about his studies.
 

 
For example, every time Shi Wandong brought a girl he liked home to study, the girl would inevitably fall in love with his older brother.
 

 
Since Shi Wandong admired his older brother so much, the stories created by his brother were naturally considered sacred. He ended up receiving the treatment of "asking his younger brother which character he liked, and then killing off that character" and "getting sabotaged during the climax."
 

 
Wei Zekai summarized:
 

 
[As an only child, half of my sense of happiness comes from Shi Wandong’s daily life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What about the other half?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The distribution of assets in my father’s will.]
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao, being so honest, didn’t know how to respond and really wanted to immediately forward this to Uncle Wei.
 

 
Unknowingly, the bad mood she had been in, caused by those odd and frustrating people, faded away as she read through one new message after another. The corners of Tong Zhao's lips curved into a gentle smile: [Alright, I get it. Not in a relationship, but working, huh?]
 

 
The topic naturally shifted to her new movie.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a mental note of all of Shi Qianqiu’s black history.
 

 
But knowing this person’s thick skin, even if she brought it up in front of him, his most likely reaction would be to take pride in it rather than be ashamed.
 

 
Ah.
 

 
Back to their scandal.
 

 
The paparazzi they ran into that day had great photography skills, and the photos turned out beautifully. After post-production filters, they captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu looking relaxed and at ease during their casual conversation, as well as her alert gaze when she realized she was being photographed. Netizens commented that it was like a switch from Omega to Alpha in an instant. Some even fantasized about the "cold and guarded towards the world, but affectionate and gentle only to you" CP (couple) dynamic...
 

 
In public, Tong Zhao always exuded a star-like aura.
 

 
It wasn’t just about what she wore, but also her facial expressions and overall demeanor. She was so beautiful that it gave off a sense of distance, never disappointing her fans.
 

 
It was rare to see her in casual attire and with a more relaxed expression, which fans took as a sweet treat, excitedly calling her "Zhao Bao" (a nickname for her).
 

 
The fans, however, were fine.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always been very tolerant of the group of people who adore her, and she only controls them a little when they show signs of aggression. Other than that, she doesn't mind when they joke around or ship her with others. After all, even the purest of actors can't avoid the fan economy; it's just a matter of the extent of their influence. Who can really be harsh on those who genuinely adore them? At least she can't. That's why she has always treated her fans like half-clients.
 

 
As long as she can satisfy them, she does her best to do so, but overall, she follows the company's and her own preferences.
 

 
When she saw clueless passersby and gossiping marketing accounts stoking the fire, Tong Zhao became a little annoyed. After discussing it with her company, she decided not to respond or clarify on her own. Let people guess all they want. If this scandal lasts until the film's promotional period, it would probably be too late to debunk it, and it could even help generate some buzz.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wants to clarify things, Tong Zhao would cooperate.
 

 
What if he suddenly wants to date someone?
 

 
It wouldn't be a good influence.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't want to be foolish and ask him how he planned to handle their scandal.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known as the "Weibo King" of the director's circle, didn't post anything to clarify.
 

 
Fans kept gossiping in his comments, and after he blocked a group of them, there were still strange comments like: [I don't support you dating Tong Zhao. Such beautiful and high-quality genes should be passed on. Since Director Shi is childfree, he should let her go.] Some even posted image comments: [They are a perfect match, how dare you, this monster, oppose them? JPG]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t bother responding, fully showing his noble and cold demeanor.
 

 
As the public discourse became heated, Tong Zhao visibly became more low-key. It wasn't until the early preparation work for ‘Neverland Girl’ was complete and the film was ready to start shooting that she went to the film studio, escorted by her assistant and driver.
 

 
...
 

 
For the part of the female lead losing her sanity, in typical instinct-driven films, the effect is often achieved by blocking part of the actor's memory backstage.
 

 
But the result is often mediocre.
 

 
It’s similar to the performances of inexperienced actors.
 

 
Even when they have amnesia, you can still tell they are acting with the mindset and demeanor of an adult.
 

 
Since this was a self-invested film, Tong Zhao boldly proposed a segmented filming approach, just like for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. The amnesia part would be played by Zhao Zai, and the parts before amnesia and after the memory recovery, where the character becomes stronger, would be played by herself.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu unconditionally supported her innovative proposal.
 

 
With the director's support, the matter was settled.
 

 
The female lead of ‘Neverland Girl’ was originally depicted as soft and dreamy, just like when she embarked on her journey into the world of "quick transmigration" (a type of genre where the protagonist travels between different worlds). She was well protected by her family, never suspecting that the evil wolf was right beside her or that her seemingly perfect best friend was secretly jealous of her to the point of madness…
 

 
The script's early stages were tightly controlled, and even though Tong Zhao's subconscious was stronger and more independent than the character's setup, she wouldn't stray too far from the role.
 

 
All the actors lay in the holographic filming chambers, connected to the equipment.
 

 
The large screen on the control desk displayed the connection status of all the devices and whether the corresponding props' codes were in place.
 

 
The most unique aspect was that only one device was shown for the lead role.
 

 
This device was connected to two modules, with one brain supporting the performances of two characters. The medical team’s gaze at Shi Qianqiu was filled with reproach, while their gaze at Tong Zhao, earlier, had been as if looking at a madwoman.
 

 
A madwoman who was willing to be cruel to herself in pursuit of the perfect ideal she had in mind.
 

 
“Neverland Girl, Action!”
 

 
...
 

 
The first thing that came into view was a luxurious mansion.
 

 
Tong Zhao received a share of the profits. The mansion, rented and then painstakingly remodeled by a template designer over half a month, represented a significant portion of the film's budget. Everywhere you looked, there were carefully arranged flowers and plants, creating a dreamy paradise that every young girl had once fantasized about. The color scheme was a harmonious blend of soft pastel pinks, blues, and yellows, resembling the style of a Disney theme park.
 

 
It was indeed a bit extravagant.
 

 
But it was the choice made after discussions between Shi Qianqiu and the art director of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
"My name is Shiya."
 

 
The camera automatically captured the lead character's movements, giving a shot of the female lead stretching after waking up.
 

 
Tong Zhao, dressed only in a white silk camisole, bathed in the soft morning light. The floral print on the curtains cast intricate shadows on her pale white arms, making her appear even more ethereal. One of the similarities between instinctive cinema and traditional cinema is that it allows the actor’s face to be modeled with makeup and claims this is their bare face just after waking up...
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t need that.
 

 
She didn’t require makeup.
 

 
Even the template designer was amazed—she could wake up early in the morning, fresh-faced, without any makeup, and still hold up to high-definition filming without a single flaw. At that moment, her expression was slightly drowsy, and a yawn caused a physiological tear, moistening her almond-shaped eyes, giving her a strong youthful vibe.
 

 
The maid, who had gotten up even earlier, stood by the bed with her hands at her sides. Once her mistress finished stretching, she skillfully helped her get dressed.
 

 
"It was always my mom who helped me get dressed. After she pulled a muscle last month, I heard the doctor told her she had to sit in a wheelchair for half a month. She reluctantly let Sister Mianmian help me instead."
 

 
"Although it feels a bit wrong..."
 

 
"But because of this, I now have one more person I can see, so I’m kind of happy."
 

 
“Sister Mianmian, I can do this myself.”
 

 
Seeing the maid about to kneel down to help her put on her shoes, Tong Zhao kindly stopped her.
 

 
The maid, however, hurriedly lowered her head, saying, "Miss, please don’t call me by my name. Madam might be upset if she hears."
 

 
The maid, with her head lowered, didn't notice the look of disappointment that appeared on Tong Zhao's face.
 

 
"I have a pair of very wealthy and loving parents."
 

 
"—It's just that they don’t like me interacting with others."
# Chapter108
The filming period for ‘The Neverland Girl’ turned out to be much longer than the industry had expected.
 

 
Generally speaking, the more special effects and large-scale scenes a movie has, the longer it takes to shoot. If the movie spans a large time period, the actors need to take breaks from the shooting tent at regular intervals, which extends the filming schedule. But ‘The Neverland Girl’... it was said to be a love story set in a luxurious mansion, with the main characters meeting online. Does it really need that much time to shoot?
 

 
Could it be that there are a lot of special effects in the villa?
 

 
The staff signed confidentiality agreements, and director Shi Qianqiu wouldn’t reveal anything, so outsiders could only guess, and the speculation was getting more intense, becoming more and more outlandish.
 

 
There was another theory.
 

 
That is, Tong Zhao had gone overboard.
 

 
He had to play two roles in a variety show, which was a sacrifice for the program team, and showed his loyalty. But could he really apply the same approach to filming a serious movie? Wasn’t he overestimating his subconscious while underestimating the difficulty of acting in a real movie? This led to a lot of criticism, and even the director, Shi Qianqiu, was seen as someone who loved stirring up trouble. Could this romance film really be reliable?
 

 
Some industry peers took advantage of the situation, and there were even whispers that competitors planning to release films around the same time were subtly shifting the narrative...
 

 
At first glance, the entire market had very little confidence in ‘The Neverland Girl’!
 

 
For other films, such rumors could damage investor confidence, leading to a conservative attitude towards marketing and distribution, ultimately creating a vicious cycle for the movie’s release. After all, in the entertainment industry, both star-making and box office revenue rely heavily on hype and traffic.
 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was different.
 

 
Whether or not the investment was made depended entirely on how Tong Zhao felt, and then on the director’s name.
 

 
Well, even if this movie was short on funds, it likely wouldn’t need to look for outside help.
 

 
Journalists, like hyenas smelling blood, flocked to the scene, using all their connections and methods to dig up any information from the crew. There’s no wall that doesn’t leak, and through their relentless efforts and mysterious tactics, they finally managed to uncover a piece of information.
 

 
What was it?
 

 
During the filming of ‘The Neverland Girl’, an additional investment was made. The amount remains undisclosed. This investment wasn’t publicly announced and was quietly added. If not for the reporters obsessively digging for details, it likely wouldn’t have been revealed. Where was this extra funding used? Was there a miscalculation in the budget? Is this yet another issue with a film funded by Tong Zhao? Countless questions were raised, but no one from the production team came forward to respond.
 

 
# ‘The Neverland Girl’ Suspected of Financial Issues
 
# Tong Zhao's First Major Setback
 

 
Voices predicting failure were everywhere, and such negativity should have shaken the confidence of potential moviegoers.
 

 
However, this common scenario seemed ineffective when it came to Tong Zhao. It was almost as though the public had a soft spot for her. The truth was simpler: her past works were so exceptional that they had instilled a reflexive thought in viewers—’Tong Zhao = Worth Watching’. The industry was shocked to uncover a startling fact:
 

 
These typical negative rumors, which would usually dampen the spirits of most film crews, had no impact on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Like many established veteran actors, she had achieved the rare ability to carry a film’s box office performance entirely on her own.
 

 
[Not listening, just watching Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Whether the movie is good or not, I’ll decide after watching it. How can you criticize a film that hasn’t even released a trailer?]
 

 
[A movie featuring Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu running out of money? That’s laughable.]
 

 
Fans naturally hoped their idol would continue to rise, each film breaking new records, becoming a walking miracle. This sentiment was true for most celebrities, but for Tong Zhao—who had repeatedly succeeded with vastly different genres—fans were even more fervent in their desire for her to deliver a perfect masterpiece.
 

 
One entertainment blogger commented:
 

 
[Are film critics being too harsh on Tong Zhao? Actually, the person who is the harshest on Tong Zhao is herself. After her success as the noble consort in ‘Emperor Ming’, she could have easily taken on more palace intrigue costume dramas. Smooth sailing, right? But she didn’t. After ‘72 Hours Countdown’, she had the perfect opportunity to transition into big-budget action movies—a guaranteed box office hit. Easy money, right? But she declined. I even saw someone on a forum say Tong Zhao has the kind of face that makes people want to fall in love, but she never takes on the safest romantic films. Romance movies? Too easy for her, apparently.
 

 
Yet, what did she do? She filmed one anyway. Surprising, isn’t it?
 

 
Even more surprising, she managed to drag Shi Qianqiu along with her.]
 

 
This entertainment blogger’s post didn’t have any manipulated comments, just genuine opinions from fans and casual viewers. The mainstream sentiment was one of recognition for Tong Zhao. A male fan who had followed her gaming livestreams shared his thoughts:
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s livestreams? I’ve watched every single one. If I missed a live session, I’d catch the replay. I can tell you, from her gaming style alone, you can see she’s adventurous and bold, willing to take risks and show off her skills. You can see this in her attitude towards life as well.]
 

 
Netizens were curious: ‘Has she always been this brave?’
 

 
She really has.
 

 
Some fans even edited a short clip from one of her livestreams.
 

 
In the clip, Tong Zhao is playing a hero character and pulls off two extreme plays in a row while barely surviving on low health, as if walking a tightrope. The chat is filled with comments asking how she dared to make such moves. Smirking, she replied, “Why wouldn’t I dare? Am I afraid of losing? Only those who dare to lose deserve to win.”
 

 
Her expression was full of wild confidence.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s usual public demeanor is calm and composed. It’s only during these rare livestream sessions that fans glimpse her youthful, daring side, and they absolutely love it. After every livestream, platforms like Douyin and Weibo explode with expertly edited highlight clips of her, attracting a whole new crowd of non-moviegoing fans. Many marvel at her gaming skills, saying, “If she became a full-time streamer, she’d definitely go viral. Why is she a movie star instead?”
 

 
One screenshot of her with a puzzled expression, paired with the quote “Am I afraid of losing?”, became a favorite response among fans to counter the critics doubting her.
 

 
So, how did ‘The Neverland Girl’ turn out?
 

 
The first ones to find out were critics and industry insiders.
 

 
Film previews come in many forms: some are rough cuts meant for internal viewing, requiring strict non-disclosure agreements, while others are polished, final versions. The preview for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was the latter. Many media professionals were invited to this event. Although the attendees signed confidentiality agreements barring them from discussing the plot in detail, they were allowed to share their overall impressions.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng was one of the invited critics.
 

 
When he received the invitation, Luo Yuanfeng was surprised.
 

 
He hadn’t expected to be invited.
 

 
It wasn't due to a lack of reputation. Luo Yuanfeng was a fairly influential film critic in the Chinese film industry. Since the advent of instinctive films, ticket prices had risen, and audiences became more cautious about a film’s quality before purchasing viewing rights. Luo Yuanfeng's review column, ‘Luo's Instinctive Musings’, brought him steady income with each new review. This revenue came from the film review site ‘Now Showing’, which paid him based on the number of clicks. Additionally, he received a share of the advertising revenue.
 

 
If a film critic overly compromised their credibility for money, it would harm their reputation, and ‘Now Showing’ would reduce their weight on the platform, indirectly limiting their exposure. Under the site’s strict oversight, most critics took great care to protect their reputations, leading to relatively fair reviews.
 

 
Among the well-known critics, Luo Yuanfeng was part of the camp predicting Tong Zhao’s new movie would fail.
 

 
If the film turned out well, fine.
 

 
But if anything was off, he was ready to tear it apart.
 

 
"It seems Tong Zhao has a lot of confidence in this movie," Luo Yuanfeng remarked to the critic seated next to him. "I don't know if I should hope for it to flop... It's a weird feeling. I kind of want to be proven wrong but also dread being disappointed."
 

 
"You’re overthinking it. I feel like just seeing Tong Zhao’s face in a romance is worth the ticket price."
 

 
This sentiment mirrored the broader public opinion.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s movies were undeniably entertaining and worth the price of admission. However, she had never played out a romance that truly resonated with audiences. Even in the closest attempt, ‘Heartless Tribulation’, viewers mostly felt her overwhelming hatred and solitary intensity. Any love she had for the male lead in flashback scenes was largely the product of Shi Qianqiu’s editing.
 

 
And most importantly, the scumbag male lead didn’t deserve her!
 

 
But Han Zhi? He was perfect!
 

 
From keyword trends and search data, it became clear that seeing Tong Zhao experience a sweet romance in a movie was a key excitement factor for many young fans.
 

 
"Do you think she’s even capable of romance?" someone wondered.
 

 
"I feel like she’s already crushed most of her male fans’ dreams."
 

 
"I’m probably more of a ‘younger brother fan.’ She’s my ideal big sister type."
 

 
...
 

 
Without needing a reminder, the room fell silent as the lights dimmed for the screening.
 

 
With a critical mindset, Luo Yuanfeng leaned forward slightly, focusing his attention to the maximum.
 

 
If this was a good film, he would write an honest review.
 

 
If Tong Zhao’s performance fell short...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng had no intention of holding back.
 

 
Beyond the questions of her dual role performance and whether she could convincingly portray romance, another thought lingered in his mind: what exactly had that mysterious additional funding been used for?
 

 
The movie began with a young, childlike version of Tong Zhao leaning lovingly against her mother in a cozy children's room, listening to her tell the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
 

 
Instinctive films, like traditional movies, often cast child actors resembling the adult leads to portray their childhood selves. The difference, however, lies in the nuances—subtle body adjustments in modeling aren't the same as complete overhauls. When an adult's subconscious is projected onto a childlike frame, the result can feel uncanny. Yet this film opened with an unconventional approach.
 

 
It must be said: the "mini" version of Tong Zhao was utterly adorable.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng, the self-proclaimed stone-hearted critic who had lambasted the entire entertainment industry, felt an inexplicable pang of guilt when he saw the character's bright, teary eyes. ‘How could I possibly criticize such a sweet little girl?’ he thought. ‘If she wants to make this movie, let her do it!’
 

 
"I wish I could be like Peter Pan and never grow up," mini Tong Zhao declared.
 

 
"Then stay by Mom and Dad’s side forever, okay?" her mother replied.
 

 
"Okay!"
 

 
The little Zhao cuddled against her mother, playfully rolling on her lap.
 

 
But she rolled too far—landing with a soft ‘plop’ onto a cushioned mat on the floor. Holding her forehead in her tiny hands, she looked up at her mother in bewilderment.
 

 
...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng thought to himself, ‘I shouldn’t have mocked that fan who called himself her “little brother.”
 

 
‘Now I want to be her “dad fan”!’
 

 
He noticed how little Zhao, nestled beside her mother, would occasionally tug gently at her skirt with her small fingers or nuzzle her soft, chubby cheeks against her mother’s hand.
 

 
These were subtle, childlike gestures unique to this younger version of Tong Zhao—gestures completely absent in her adult self.
 

 
How was she able to do this?
 

 
Seeing this petite version of Tong Zhao, Luo Yuanfeng saw not only an impossibly cute little girl but also a phenomenon beyond comprehension. The same subconscious mind that could switch between cold ruthlessness and captivating allure in her adult roles somehow managed to adjust its temperament to perfectly suit a childlike innocence.
 

 
But how could an adult’s subconscious fit so seamlessly into the body of a child?
 

 
And not just any adult—a celebrity’s subconscious at that!
 

 
In Shi Qianqiu’s lens, Luo Yuanfeng felt as though he were truly traveling through time, catching a glimpse of Tong Zhao before her family life was upended.
 

 
The screening room, filled with some of the most disciplined and professional viewers, couldn't help themselves. At that moment, the audience broke into soft murmurs, marveling at what they were witnessing.
# Chapter109
Incredible...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng couldn't focus on analyzing the rest of the movie's plot.
 

 
The mini version of Tong Zhao on the screen even seemed a bit unfamiliar. As someone who had been closely following the rise of this popular star, Luo Yuanfeng knew her better than many of Tong Zhao's fans... though of course, he couldn’t say they were particularly close. The Tong Zhao he knew was the epitome of mature and cold beauty. He had even had the privilege of witnessing her display her charm at the premiere of ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Of course, many idol stars who were new and lacked background would subconsciously flaunt their charms to gain attention and special treatment, with some going so far as to overstep boundaries. After all, many powerful figures in those circles controlled resources that newcomers desperately sought. Luo Yuanfeng didn’t judge these people, but Tong Zhao was different. Every frown and smile of hers exuded a mature, seductive charm, yet she always knew how to keep things perfectly balanced... At least, no one who had interacted with her felt that she was the type of star who could be bought with money.
 

 
She was the kind of unattainable, unreachable beauty.
 

 
Yet, people still wanted to exert effort to please her, to win her favor, just to see her turn around and smile at them.
 

 
In short, Luo Yuanfeng’s impression of Tong Zhao was that of a mature, cold, fox-like beauty.
 

 
What Luo Yuanfeng didn’t know was that the Tong Zhao he had seen back then—
 

 
Was the very same rare personality who hardly ever appeared in real life. If she did appear, her WeChat contacts would inevitably gain a flood of high-profile, influential personalities: Consort Chen.
 

 
After the childhood of the female lead was revealed, the scene in the movie shifted, and grown-up Sylia appeared. Shi Qianqiu, a director with extensive experience, not only packed the screen with enough visual information, but his shot composition also allowed the audience to easily understand the kind of environment the female lead grew up in. The buildings on screen were magnificent, and her parents were overly doting on her, yet the audience could still sense that something was off.
 

 
Seeing this, Luo Yuanfeng quickly forced himself to snap out of his shock over the younger version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Summon your professional spirit!
 

 
Focus on finishing the movie. This early screening doesn’t offer a replay.
 

 
‘Shi Qianqiu is a genius at directing…’
 

 
‘Who’s the art director for this film? Shi’s aesthetic sense remains top-tier.’
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng knew the primary filming location for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was a bare-bones villa with a small garden at most.
 

 
What appeared on the big screen, however, was far beyond that. Every blade of grass and every tree exuded the painstaking efforts of the art director and the production team. The setting lacked any ostentatious "new money" vibe and didn’t conform to the reserved elegance of "old money." Instead, the exaggerated details and lighting crafted a dreamlike fairy-tale world.
 

 
Just as Luo Yuanfeng was reflecting on this, the adult Tong Zhao made her appearance.
 

 
’This isn’t the same Tong Zhao I’ve seen in person.’
 

 
Accompanied by lighthearted music, Tong Zhao appeared on screen bathed in the golden glow of morning sunlight. "Tong Zhao always looks so stunning under Director Shi’s lens," someone whispered. "Didn’t they have some romance rumors recently? Maybe there’s some truth to it." When Tong Zhao flashed a slightly sleepy, lazy smile at a maid, Luo Yuanfeng began to doubt his own memories.
 

 
It’s a well-known fact in the entertainment industry that many celebrities’ public personas are fabricated. Believing the personas crafted by entertainment companies to be the stars' true selves would make anyone a fool.
 

 
Typically, the consensus is that these stars—often masters of time management, notorious heartthrobs, or femme fatales—pretend to be innocent in front of the camera. But with Tong Zhao, the situation seemed reversed. Could it be that her usual seductive, coldly elegant, and wise demeanor was an act? Was she, in reality, a sweet and soft-hearted young girl? Or even capable of convincingly playing a childlike role?
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng wasn’t alone in his astonishment.
 

 
Most critics had expected Tong Zhao’s take on a romance film to feature a dynamic where, even if not female-dominated, there would at least be equality in power and agency.
 

 
But wait—who was this obedient, innocent darling who seemed ready to be whisked away by any man?
 

 
Was ‘Sylia’ played by some freshly debuted young idol?
 

 
And, oh, it looked like someone was actually going to kidnap her character!
 

 
Some critics who hadn’t read the script beforehand sighed when Han Zhi made his entrance. “If Tong Zhao were a man,” they remarked, “there’d be no competition for male leads in the industry—this guy’s charm is off the charts...”
 

 
Wait, what?
 

 
This guy’s a con artist?
 

 
Han Zhi, doubting that his girlfriend’s mental state had truly reverted to that of a child, infiltrated the Si family as a doctor. Seizing a moment when they were alone, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her, leaning close. “You really don’t remember anything?” Sylia shook her head, staring at him in confusion. He kissed her again, this time more passionately. “Truly don’t remember, or just pretending not to?”
 

 
And so, he kissed her again. And again. And again...
 

 
Critics & special audience members: ..
 

 
Anger rising. Fists clenched.
 

 
This scene went surprisingly smoothly, something Shi Qianqiu hadn’t anticipated.
 

 
After her subconscious was "juvenilized," Tong Zhao's personality became simple and naive but still remained firm and proactive—a child with her own strong opinions. She didn’t seem like someone who would passively allow a strange man to shower her with a whirlwind of kisses. However, Han Zhi was essentially ‘Tong Zhao herself’. Subconsciously, Zhao Zai (the childlike version of Tong Zhao) felt an instinctive closeness to that face. In her subconscious mind palace, only Han Zhi and Lu Xianzhang (another character) had her trust, while the Imperial Concubine sister constantly bullied her.
 

 
When it came to projecting a sense of youthful innocence, Tong Zhao employed a bit of cleverness.
 

 
The system she worked with didn’t include any marketplace or rewards like "beauty boosts" or "superpowers." Its sole function was to motivate her to live each life meaningfully and actively complete tasks in different worlds. The system shielded her from becoming apathetic or detached—a “zen-like old soul” who felt indifferent to everything. As part of this, the system allowed her to temporarily block certain memories and experiences upon request.
 

 
Before entering the immersion pod, Tong Zhao chose to erase all memories of her multi-world journeys, resetting herself to the state she had been in before her mother passed away.
 

 
At that time, she hadn’t yet learned that her best friend was actually her half-sister, nor had she realized how swiftly she could fall from her privileged, sheltered life into the harsh reality of the world. Back then, she was still a well-protected young heiress.
 

 
About a third into the movie, the critics finally understood where the additional funding had gone.
 

 
After Sylia’s attempted suicide resulted in her mind regressing to that of a child, the entire world as seen through her eyes was enhanced with breathtaking, extremely expensive special effects! The sun smiled down at her, clouds had soft pink edges, and every brick, tile, plant, and blade of grass in the villa’s garden shimmered under a painterly, vividly saturated filter.
 

 
What’s more, Shi Qianqiu’s masterful touch ensured that none of it looked garish or cheap. The vibrant visuals, paired with Sylia’s innocent and joyful smiles, were absolutely mesmerizing!
 

 
It was as if two distinct worlds had been built on the same set of production codes.
 

 
Although the scope of the scenes wasn’t expansive, this technique...
 

 
It was classic Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
This technique, where the external scenery shifts along with the character's emotional changes, is more commonly seen in exaggerated animation. In live-action romance films without fantasy elements, it’s rare to employ such a method. However, this bold approach undeniably delivered a visual feast to the audience.
 

 
With Tong Zhao and Han Zhi already boasting top-tier looks, Shi Qianqiu’s lens elevated their beauty to almost unbearable levels.
 

 
‘Wow, if this movie becomes a hit, forget about Director Shi—this art director’s worth will skyrocket!’
 

 
Zhao Zai’s subconscious stubbornness altered the script yet again. The "childlike regression" didn’t lower her intelligence. She faintly sensed something suspicious about the male lead. However, Han Zhi was a grandmaster at deceiving both women and children. The push-and-pull dynamic between them sparked unique chemistry. By the middle of the film, Luo Yuanfeng had numbly accepted the reality that beneath Tong Zhao’s icy exterior lay a pure and tender soul.
 

 
It was astonishing. Although she had the appearance of a teenage girl, she was unmistakably just a child at heart.
 

 
And the male lead? He could still make a move?
 

 
‘Beast. Utter beast!’
 

 
In truth, apart from the initial whirlwind of kisses during his "test" of his girlfriend, Han Zhi’s most intimate actions afterward were limited to holding hands, hugging, or forehead kisses. There was no question of crossing the line. Yet, somehow, the live audience had unconsciously unified as overprotective "dad fans."
 

 
For a doting father, even a stranger glancing at his precious daughter was a sin!
 

 
‘Holding hands? Chop that paw off!’
 

 
---
 

 
During the backstage shoot, the crew closely monitored Zhao Zai’s psychological activity. When they noticed she had caught onto something suspicious about the male lead Nie Su, they were prepared to intervene and adjust the plot. After all, in the original script, Sylia remained completely oblivious until she regained her memories, at which point Nie Su confessed the truth, having been moved by her.
 

 
But what do you do when the heroine is too perceptive and figures out the male lead is a scumbag liar ahead of schedule?
 

 
Zhao Zai was too sharp!
 

 
However, Han Zhi, another facet of Tong Zhao’s personality, was equally formidable.
 

 
He withstood Zhao Zai’s growing suspicions and managed to explain away one inconsistency after another. While he admitted he had been hiding something, he assured her:
 

 
"I promise you, whatever I’m concealing is not meant to hurt you."
 

 
From Zhao Zai's perspective, the little bridge and flowing water in the villa's garden not only had water, but also a shimmering galaxy. Han Zhi’s character, Nie Su, gazed at her seriously, his eyes full of deep affection and inescapable melancholy. He had truly fallen for her, but the reality was that his girlfriend’s mental state had regressed to that of a child due to her refusal to grow up, and the cruel fact that their family backgrounds were worlds apart.
 

 
The reason behind the heroine’s mental regression, apart from the trauma from her suicide, was also the emotional manipulation and moral coercion from her parents, which had caused her to break down.
 

 
Since she couldn’t have freedom, she would rather not have it at all.
 

 
It was not that her parents didn’t want to let her go, but that she didn’t want to grow up, didn’t want to leave the house. As long as she stood on the same side as her parents, staying as the obedient child who didn’t want to leave home, she wouldn’t hurt anyone, and she wouldn’t suffer anymore.
 

 
Nie Su wasn’t a real psychologist, but he was the person who understood Sylia better than anyone else in the world.
 

 
In their previous online relationship, there were many things Sylia couldn’t say to her parents, but she had confided in him, speaking very frankly. Nie Su had vaguely sensed her emotional struggles and was troubled about how to rekindle her desire for growth.
 

 
And Sylia, gazing at Nie Su, felt a faint blush rise on her cheeks.
 

 
The moon in the sky, influenced by her emotional change, turned from yellow to red in an instant and shyly hid behind the clouds.
 

 
While the male lead was still troubled about how to make her want to grow up…
 

 
Due to the awakening of her romantic feelings, she now had a slight desire to grow up.
 

 
As the subconscious influence of Tong Zhao altered the plot, Shi Qianqiu didn’t stop it—in fact, he welcomed the change.
 

 
Change it! Keep changing it!
 

 
Thus, although the male lead didn’t say it directly, it was essentially exposed ahead of time.
 

 
In the original script, in order to ignite the heroine’s desire for the outside world, Nie Su had idealized much of it. This led to the eventual confession where he revealed that the adult world wasn’t as great as it seemed and was full of bad people—he was one of them.
 

 
However, Han Zhi’s subconscious slowly began to share his true situation with the heroine.
 

 
Zhao Zai listened, realizing that her big brother had done a lot of bad things!
 

 
Han Zhi: "So if you keep being picky and refuse to eat your green peppers, but then eat a whole bag of candy every day, you'll end up like me—living by lying to people and getting cavities."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so shocked that she covered her cheek, which was aching slightly from her teeth.
 

 
Zhao Zai still liked her big brother a lot. She wanted to change him.
 

 
"I’m not going to listen to a little kid. You need to grow up quickly if you want to teach me a lesson."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and patted her head.
# Chapter110
Love is a complex emotion.
 

 
Adults often say, “What do kids know about love?” But in reality, many adults don’t truly understand what love is either. In English, there’s a term, ‘puppy love’, to describe this kind of innocent, naive affection—like puppies snuggling together, radiating pure sincerity without any impurities.
 

 
What is love, and why must we understand it?
 
How does one learn to love and to be loved? Is there a course or a major dedicated to the art of pursuing someone romantically?
 
When is it time to give up on love? How can one determine the value of persistence or know if they truly like someone, as opposed to just following others’ opinions that they *seem like a good match*?
 

 
Han Zhi scored major points in front of the female protagonist’s parents, making them fully believe that he was helping their daughter recover from her psychological issues.
 

 
But the truth? Han Zhi didn’t know a thing about it.
 

 
The script hadn’t provided him with any professional psychology expertise, nor did Han Zhi have any training in the field. Every day, under the guise of “treatment,” he taught the female protagonist all the practical knowledge a functioning adult needs to navigate society.
 

 
In a quiet underground library surrounded by wooden bookshelves, the shelves were filled with the Shi family’s private collection. However, starkly contrasting with the intellectual tomes were the brightly colored children’s books on the bottom two shelves. These were bought by her parents when Sylia was younger, positioned to match her height at the time. Even now, her parents still firmly believed she should be reading these books.
 

 
Dressed in a white floral dress, Sylia slumped ungracefully over the desk and lazily lifted her gaze toward Nie Su. “Big Brother Nie, what are we learning today?”
 

 
Nie Su placed his laptop on the desk and opened a document.
 

 
The document’s title read: “100 Ways to Teach the Mentally Inept How to Live.”
 

 
Sylia’s sharp eyes caught the title and asked curiously, “What does ‘mentally inept’ mean?”
 

 
“A low-energy lifestyle,” Nie Su explained with a straight face, “is just another name for the trendy low-carbon lifestyle.” He added, “Don’t mention this term in front of your dad.”
 

 
“That means it’s a bad word,” Sylia declared confidently.
 

 
“You’re the hardest kid I’ve ever had to fool.”
 

 
“Really? Even compared to when you were a kid, Brother Nie?”
 

 
“Almost,” Nie Su admitted, pulling up the day’s lesson plan. “Because when I was a kid, I was the one fooling others.”
 

 
Sylia’s round almond eyes widened in shock at this revelation.
 

 
The camera zoomed in, revealing the day’s topics on Nie Su’s screen:
 

 
- How to Find a Suitable Job? (Subtopics: Avoiding MLM scams, workplace manipulation, and exploitative environments)
 
- How to Make New Friends? (Subtopics: Identifying malicious intentions in fake friends)
 
- How to Avoid Saying the Wrong Thing
 
- The Dynamics of Mutual Exploitation in Relationships
 
- How to Reject Pursuers (Highlighted and in bold!!!)
 

 
…
 

 
The audience quickly realized that aside from the suspicious self-interest in the last topic, the rest were essential life lessons. These were things schools never teach but that everyone is expected to know as soon as they step into the real world.
 

 
Though Sylia had never attended a formal school, she was taught by private tutors from a young age. Her academic knowledge matched that of a typical college student, but it ended there. Her parents, fearful that too much education might make her want to leave home, limited her learning—but couldn’t bear to leave her entirely uneducated.
 

 
Sylia tilted her head in doubt. “What’s the point of learning all this?”
 

 
“Every adult needs to know these things,” Nie Su replied with a faintly mocking smile on his otherwise composed face. “Schools teach you math, languages, and science. Your family teaches you morality and values. But when you enter society, all you’ll face are scams, cons, lies, and traps. Those without strong minds end up addicted to gambling, drugs, and other vices.”
 

 
The phrasing of this line—short, snappy, and full of rhythm—drew laughs from the audience. But after the laughter, many found themselves reflecting: wasn’t there a grain of truth in his words?
 

 
Nie Su laid bare the cruel and harsh realities of society for Sylia, teaching her about the darker aspects of life.
 

 
Yet, in contrast to his scheming and jaded worldview, Sylia was like a pure little angel untouched by the world’s corruption. Through these lessons, she unintentionally offered him a new perspective. While the characters had the physical forms of mature adults, the audience couldn’t help but see them as two adorable, innocent children rolling around on a grassy field—endearingly sweet and heartwarming.
 

 
Although she knew she couldn’t enjoy whirlwind kisses forever without growing up, the pure-hearted Sylia thought these days weren’t bad at all.
 

 
As long as Brother Nie was by her side, the outside world didn’t seem so tempting anymore.
 

 
---
 

 
During the filming of this segment, the writers’ team became quite anxious.
 

 
The climax of ‘Neverland Girl’ was supposed to involve the male protagonist confessing to the female lead that he was a liar—a bad person.
 

 
But now? A villain?
 

 
The female lead had already figured that out and was even trying to reform him. On top of that, the male lead seemed nearly reformed already.
 

 
At this rate, the story was heading straight for a happily-ever-after ending, skipping the drama entirely.
 

 
A happily-ever-after ending is nice, but it can sometimes feel lacking in drama, leaving the story less grand and impactful. Most creators share the same dilemma: readers wish for the protagonists to live happily ever after, perhaps even getting married and enjoying lifelong bliss. Meanwhile, the author muses, “Should I throw in a natural disaster or a human tragedy first?”—to heighten the pacing and dramatic tension.
 

 
The screenwriters were worried, but Shi Qianqiu, the director, remained calm.
 

 
He trusted Tong Zhao's subconscious meddling abilities, especially her male alter-ego named "Han Zhi," who excelled at stirring things up in matters of love.
 

 
And sure enough—
 

 
Nie Su, played by Han Zhi, discovered that Sylia had fallen in love with him once again. She still didn’t want to grow up, but this time, it wasn’t out of pain or self-loathing. Instead, it stemmed from sweet happiness, a desire to remain in this blissful state. Adding to the tension, Shi’s parents had begun to notice the sparks between the two. Shi’s father made a bold proposal: he offered a high salary to essentially “buy” Nie Su’s life, on the condition that Nie Su stayed with their daughter, never leaving, and guarding their home forever.
 

 
As long as their daughter was happy and stayed within the safe and warm confines of the house, the parents were willing to make any compromise.
 

 
Of course, children moving out for work and returning home for meals and rest is perfectly normal. In the Shi family’s case, with their immense wealth, even living with her parents after marriage wouldn’t be an issue. As the most level-headed character in the entire film, Nie Su understood that the parents, too, had psychological issues. However, their actions—though flawed—were rooted in love and would never harm their daughter.
 

 
In a society under such high pressure, who doesn’t carry a few mental scars?
 

 
Nie Su left behind a recording and quit his job, disappearing from their lives.
 

 
---
 

 
The Recording:
 
“I know you’ve been reading romance novels recently. Some male protagonists tell their heroines that as long as they’re around, the heroine can remain a child forever. I might not be someone capable of offering that kind of promise. Your parents, on the other hand, probably can.
 

 
But I believe that only by becoming an adult first can one have the privilege of choosing to act like a child in front of someone special.”
 

 
“This is the last lesson I’ll teach you, kid.”
 

 
“When you grow up… you’ll find that some relationships don’t end with arguments or betrayals. Sometimes, they end simply because two people choose different paths. When the final goodbye arrives, it’s often without warning. Later, when you think back on it, you’ll wish you had known it was the last meeting—so you could hug that person tightly.”
 

 
Nie Su let out a soft laugh—a gentle, warm sound. Even the distortion of the old tape recorder couldn’t obscure his exceptional voice.
 

 
“Not wanting to grow up isn’t wrong. The adult world isn’t that great, after all.
 

 
But I refuse to be the reason you develop a new kind of illness.”
 

 
“I’m a failed adult. There’s only so much I can teach you. If, in the future, you come to new realizations and insights, trust yourself. Don’t doubt your judgment. I believe you’ll grow into an adult who’s a thousand times better than I ever was.”
 

 
“Kid, I really like you.”
 

 
“But the one I love is Sylia.”
 

 
---
 

 
At this point, the director seamlessly tied all the narrative threads together:
 

 
From the very beginning, Nie Su had loved Sylia. Their relationship had started as an online romance, despite having never met in person. It was this love that prevented him from committing greater crimes. He gave up his "pig butchering scam" schemes for wealth, sought her out when she vanished from his life, and helped her resolve her emotional burdens.
 

 
Because of his exceptional emotional intelligence, Nie Su realized that his presence made it easier for Sylia to cope with her struggles. Yet he also knew that deep down, she still wanted to grow up.
 

 
This wasn’t about money. The innate curiosity and desire to explore the unknown are fundamental instincts of childhood.
 

 
Sylia burst into tears. After crying her heart out, she wiped her eyes and prepared to chase after him.
 

 
Nie Su’s guess was correct. Sylia indeed resolved her inner struggles because of him. She stood her ground before her parents, promising she would always come home early, and even if she stayed out all night, she would inform them where she was staying.
 

 
With her parents' support, Sylia began to take on the family business while searching for Nie Su.
 

 
In the closing scenes of the film, traces of the Shi parents’ overprotectiveness remained. For example, if Sylia had to go on a week-long business trip and her aging parents couldn’t physically accompany her, they would rent out the entire hotel where she stayed to ensure no dangerous individuals could book nearby rooms. This kind of extravagant behavior exasperated Sylia, who turned the resourcefulness to her advantage by hosting her business partners at the hotel.
 

 
Every piece of practical advice Nie Su had taught her about surviving adulthood came in handy.
 

 
But she couldn’t find Nie Su.
 

 
Now free to live her life, Sylia developed a deep passion for learning. Every quarter, she hired a private tutor to teach her a new skill three times a week during her free time from work. This might include cooking French cuisine, driving, flower arranging, tea ceremonies, electrical work, or painting—anything that seemed like a worthwhile craft. Anyone who thought they could teach the heiress a useful skill was welcome to apply.
 

 
However, the job posting included one peculiar, non-mandatory requirement:
 

 
“Preference will be given to candidates with the surname Nie.”
 

 
Sylia knew he would understand. As long as this job posting remained, it was her way of telling him that he would always hold the top priority in her heart.
 

 
Meanwhile, after repaying his debts and finding his footing in life, Nie Su finally appeared late one night in front of the towering Shi Corporation building after an exhausting overtime shift.
 

 
This time, when they met again, they were both weary yet hopeful adults, each with a clear direction in life.

As the film came to an end, thunderous applause erupted.
 

 
Since this was a preview screening, the audience consisted of movie enthusiasts and seasoned viewers. They had quietly endured the film up until this moment, and now their pent-up excitement poured forth in an explosion of commentary:
 

 
“I never thought Tong Zhao’s portrayal of romance could be this moving.”
 

 
“I think it’s thanks to the male lead. His emotions were expressed with such subtlety.”
 

 
“True, you can’t deny that. His controversial past made his character more layered and complex. In comparison, Tong Zhao’s character felt a bit simpler. But her performance as Sylia deserves a perfect score—can anyone explain to me how she managed to embody the psyche of a child without making it seem unnatural!?”
 

 
Amidst the heated debate over whether the male or female lead performed better, someone tentatively chimed in:
 

 
“Uh… you do realize the male lead was also played by Tong Zhao, right?”
 

 
This revelation brought an abrupt hush to the once-lively discussion.
 

 
Tong Zhao was like an exquisite, multifaceted wine. Poured into different vessels, she could reflect an array of dazzling lights.
 

 
The only constant across all her portrayals was that she always shone so brilliantly.
# Chapter111
After a brief silence, the screening hall buzzed with activity.
 

 
As the lights in the hall brightened, a few staff members entered, and in their midst, smiling warmly, was the movie's leading actress, Tong Zhao. Her appearance was greeted with another wave of applause. When she picked up a wireless microphone and smiled at the audience, the applause gradually subsided.
 

 
“Hello, everyone. Did you enjoy the movie?”
 

 
The audience responded with unanimous cheers and applause. Tong Zhao graciously expressed her gratitude as the lead actress, then transitioned into the Q&A segment.
 

 
Once given permission to record, the invited reporters eagerly raised their cameras, trying to capture both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu in the frame. The two had been the subject of rumors ever since their private meeting a while back.
 

 
Though that gossip had faded over time, the release of ‘Neverland Girl’ had inevitably brought them back into the spotlight.
 

 
Young, attractive, and undeniably wealthy, collaborating on a film together—it was an irresistible story for the media. Even without chasing scandalous headlines, positive coverage of these two was already a huge draw.
 

 
If they were truly dating, there seemed little reason to keep it under wraps. Tong Zhao’s PR team had always been skilled, and she wasn’t reliant on a fan base enamored with her single status. Unless, of course, theirs was a more casual relationship with no intention of commitment. After all, in their industry, such casual arrangements were not uncommon given the long periods of separation.
 

 
Serious relationships required one party to compromise significantly, and most romances in the entertainment world often unraveled due to clashing schedules. A quiet breakup would be considered a best-case scenario.
 

 
Publicizing a relationship, only to break up in two or three months? That would be damaging to their public image.
 

 
Ending things privately and then announcing the split six months later might work, but if someone caved to their biological urges in the meantime and was caught by paparazzi, it would result in a public outcry. The “cheater” would face backlash, while the “betrayed” party would garner sympathy but risk damaging their high-end image.
 

 
Thus, unless caught red-handed or overwhelmed by their emotions, most celebrities would insist they were just “friends” while dating a fellow entertainer. If the relationship stabilized, they could always go public later.
 

 
After some wandering thoughts, the reporters resigned themselves to the conclusion that unless there was undeniable evidence, these two would never publicly confirm a relationship. The dream of a breaking news story was dashed, but the cameras kept snapping away, aiming for any interactions or glances shared between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, the internet loved this kind of content.
 

 
“Is it true that what initially attracted you to ‘Neverland Girl’ was the script?”
 

 
“Yes,” Tong Zhao nodded with a smile. “I found it to be a captivating love story that balances entertainment and depth, and the roles really allowed me to showcase my strengths.”
 

 
...Well.
 

 
The critics who had confidently claimed that Tong Zhao wasn’t suited for romance films must’ve been feeling the sting now.
 

 
Their embarrassment was palpable yet impossible to deny. The film’s quality spoke for itself; there was no point in pretending otherwise.
 

 
“Is there any role that ‘isn’t’ suited for you? Probably not!”
 

 
The atmosphere at the screening was relaxed, and a well-known critic joked loudly.
 

 
The crowd erupted in laughter, with many chiming in agreement.
 

 
Half of the crowd genuinely believed that there wasn’t a role Tong Zhao couldn’t master.
 

 
The other half, who had previously doubted her, now shamelessly joined her fanbase, pretending nothing had ever happened.
 

 
“Actually, there are some roles I probably couldn’t pull off,” Tong Zhao admitted candidly. “For instance, my subconscious likely wouldn’t suit playing a submissive character—unless it’s due to external pressures, and there’s a redemption arc later. Otherwise, I’d probably break character.”
 

 
Hearing this, the audience realized she might be right. Tong Zhao had never played a submissive role.
 

 
In the era of instinctive films, it wasn’t unusual for actors to have roles they couldn’t tackle. Forcing them to diversify beyond their abilities often led to more harm than good. Some critics even nodded in agreement, whispering to their neighbors, “If Tong Zhao could settle down and focus on similar roles, it’d be great.”
 

 
Due to spoiler restrictions, some topics in the Q&A session were off-limits.
 

 
When the conversation touched on plot-related questions, they couldn’t go into too much detail. However, someone asked Shi Qianqiu, “Toward the end of the movie, we were all holding our breath! Director Shi, you’ve always had faith in Tong Zhao’s subconscious ability to handle adversity, but were you ever worried?”
 

 
“Oh, absolutely. And my worries came true,” Shi Qianqiu replied, furrowing his brows, his expression heavy with thought.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s good looks amplified the audience’s empathy. Could Tong Zhao have really fallen short in some way? The crowd leaned in eagerly.
 

 
“The script’s ending was open-ended, entirely dependent on how the protagonists’ subconscious performed. That’s a hallmark of instinctive romance films,” Shi explained. “But I was hoping for a more realistic conclusion...”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao, who knew Shi Qianqiu all too well, gave him a look of mild disdain.
 

 
Her gaze practically screamed ‘disapproval’.
 

 
The reporters perked up with excitement.
 

 
—Could there be tension between the lead actress and the director?
 

 
Using his wistful, intellectual tone, Shi Qianqiu elaborated on his ideal ending: “I envisioned Sylia fully integrating into this utilitarian world, treating her first love as a fond memory. She’d go from being the princess of Neverland to the queen of a business empire. Meanwhile, after repaying his debts, Nie Su joins a grueling 996 company, which turns out to be owned by Shi’s family. He ultimately dies from overwork due to continuous overtime. In a way, he sacrifices his life for his first love. I even planned out how this scene would be edited—his commercial value would perfectly match the worth of one tiny diamond on the tiara Sylia wears at her billion-dollar wedding.”
 

 
...
 

 
The room fell into an awkward silence.
 

 
Tong Zhao broke it with a sharp quip: “I think the first thing that should be cut is your commentary.”
 

 
“No way,” Shi Qianqiu retorted.
 

 
True to his reputation as a master of rebuttal, Shi Qianqiu clung to the microphone with determination. “I actually had a lot of ideas. When refining the script, I dug plenty of metaphorical holes for the leads—probably three major ones. After the public release, interested viewers are welcome to explore them.”
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu took over, the task of refining the script for ‘Neverland Girl’ fell entirely to him.
 

 
Writing scripts for holographic films was unlike traditional methods—it involved elements of programming. The more refined the script, the larger the workload, akin to creating a highly interactive ‘Galgame’. Shi Qianqiu’s apparent lack of interest in giving the leads a happy ending irked some critics who had become protective “dad fans” of Tong Zhao’s character.
 

 
“Don’t worry,” Shi Qianqiu reassured, smiling charmingly. “When it comes to digging holes, I’m a professional. Even if the protagonists fall into them, it won’t detract from the story’s brilliance. It just means the brilliance will take on a slightly different direction.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Hmm, to avoid reshooting and burning through our limited budget, my subconscious really gave it its all.”
 

 
The screening room erupted into laughter.
 

 
Because of the budget constraints, someone naturally asked about where the additional funding had been spent. This led to a discussion of another highlight of the film: after the female protagonist develops a psychological condition, everything around her takes on a dreamlike, fairy-tale quality. Flowers gently sway in sync with her joyful emotions, and when she hides under her blanket, it transforms into a secret base, complete with a tiny hanging lamp.
 

 
These visual wonders were a testament to the director's team and the art director's aesthetic vision and creativity.
 

 
With visuals like these, it seemed inevitable the film would secure a Best Visual Effects award.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known for his willingness to spend generously, wasn’t using his own money this time. Thankfully, the investors trusted him and were willing to inject additional funds despite widespread skepticism at the time. Upon reflection, some critics realized that the investor was none other than Zeshan, the company helmed by Tong Zhao herself. Of course, she trusted her own judgment! In the entertainment industry, few could match Tong Zhao's confidence.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu commented, “This adjustment was Tong Zhao’s idea. I merely brought her vision to life.”
 

 
Suddenly, all eyes turned to Tong Zhao with newfound admiration.
 

 
What a talent—not only excelling in acting but also demonstrating sharp business acumen.
 

 
Everything she invested in seemed to succeed, and even a casual suggestion turned out to be a major highlight of the movie.
 

 
Most of the audience were savvy individuals.
 

 
At least, they were knowledgeable about instinctive films. They quickly recognized that ‘Neverland Girl’ had initially been a more artistic, low-budget project with minimal sets. Typically, even if the storyline was excellent and critically acclaimed, viewers would likely opt for the cheaper, traditional viewing format. This significantly reduced its appeal.
 

 
That’s why so many art films with box-office ambitions laboriously crammed in visual effects to boost their draw.
 

 
However, many such attempts felt forced, resulting in a disjointed mess. Tong Zhao’s idea, on the other hand, fit perfectly. Her suggestion might even open up a lucrative new direction for romantic films in the instinctive cinema genre. A whimsical fairy-tale romance that could explore deeper themes, much like Shi Qianqiu’s darker, grittier take beneath the fairy-tale veneer.
 

 
As Zeshan continued to expand, some critics who understood films admitted they were less informed about the business world.
 

 
Just how vast was the financial backing behind Tong Zhao?
 

 
Was ‘Neverland Girl’ merely a one-off experiment born out of necessity—when there was a great script but no suitable team—or was it a stepping stone for Tong Zhao’s evolution from actress to producer?
 

 
Eyes filled with curiosity and contemplation landed on Tong Zhao. What truly intrigued them now wasn’t just her beauty but how much further she could go in her career.
 

 
“I only came up with an idea,” Tong Zhao humbly clarified. “The hard work of turning my idea into a reality on screen was thanks to the director’s team and the art department. All the stunning visuals you see in the film are the result of their tireless efforts, painstakingly crafted from scratch. If credit is to be given, I’d say my contribution is worth one-tenth, at most.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t claim credit.
 

 
At the time, her motivation was simple: since “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of her) rarely had the chance to experience holographic filmmaking, she wanted her to have fun with it. Filming such projects felt a bit like living through a multidimensional travel adventure, and the aftereffects were profound. Tong Zhao’s suggestions were purely indulgent, fulfilling the childlike dreams of her subconscious self.
 

 
These were wild childhood fantasies she had long forgotten.
 

 
While the idea was brilliant, its success wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of the crew.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s exceptional aesthetic sense crafted a beautiful dream for “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of Tong Zhao).
 

 
With her "inner child" receiving such care, Tong Zhao found herself looking at Shi Qianqiu more favorably.
 

 
And Shi Qianqiu? He found her just as agreeable, eager to lock down their next collaboration, where he could plot new challenges for her to tackle.
 

 
---
 

 
The buzz about ‘Neverland Girl’ receiving critical acclaim quickly spread throughout the industry.
 

 
The art director’s reputation skyrocketed, and Shi Qianqiu—already known as a box office magnet—only solidified his legendary status. The additional accolades simply added more brilliance to the crown he wore with nonchalance.
 

 
Critics were raving:
 

 
- “A romantic visual spectacle, crafted by the most enchanting subconscious mind, creating this winter’s most poignant love story.”
 
- “A fairy tale for adults! Shi Qianqiu—the man who best understands how to tap into Tong Zhao’s subconscious charm.”
 
- “If only Han Zhi, the fictional male lead, really existed!”
 
- “Tong Zhao, I’m your dad!”
 

 
Aside from the last headline—a dramatic outburst from an overzealous fan critic—the reviews from those who attended the screening read as though they’d all been paid to shower the film with praise.
 

 
This stirred online debate: Was it an expensive PR stunt, or was the movie truly that good?
 

 
Of course, there were some more neutral takes:
 

 
- “The exaggerated character setups make it difficult for the film to deeply explore its intended themes. It barely scratches the surface, but it’s still an excellent romance movie.”
 
- “I don’t think this film deserves any plot-related awards, but it absolutely deserves a nomination for its visual effects.”
 
- “The entire movie leans on the charisma of the male and female leads’ subconscious minds.”
 

 
Overall, the praise outweighed the criticism.
 

 
The initial skepticism online about Tong Zhao playing two roles simultaneously vanished as if it had never existed. Instead, several critics lamented on social media and in their columns that no young actor in real life could match the allure of Han Zhi, the fictional male lead. "If only someone like him were real," they sighed.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu’s masterful promotional strategy, the film’s marketing campaign was in full swing. It successfully brought Tong Zhao, who had deliberately reduced her public appearances recently, back into the spotlight.
 

 
However, the tactics used weren’t exactly conventional.
 

 
At the screening, reporters carefully selected a set of photos where the two appeared together and shared them in the news. When compiled, these photos told a story that caught everyone’s attention:
 

 
When Tong Zhao spoke with a microphone in hand, Shi Qianqiu was watching her intently. And when Shi Qianqiu, known for his mischievous comments, made his usual offbeat remarks, the usually composed Tong Zhao shot him a sideways glance—playful, teasing, and filled with a familiarity that spoke volumes.
 

 
Her beautiful, expressive eyes met his, revealing a connection outsiders couldn’t penetrate.
 

 
This was love, plain and simple!
 

 
The invited reporters, to their credit, didn’t sensationalize the photos. Instead, they subtly hinted at the exchange of glances between the two, encouraging netizens to comment and share their interpretations.
 

 
The buzz was nothing to be ashamed of.
 

 
Before the fans had time to get heartbroken, the company quickly issued an official statement, clarifying the previous secret meeting and explaining that they had met to discuss a movie collaboration, with no romantic intentions between the two at the moment.
 

 
The discussion among netizens was lively, with the scandal trending on social media, inevitably bringing up their collaborative movie.
 

 
Back and forth, this also saved a small chunk of the budget.
 

 
[I'm so anxious! Why hasn't it been released yet? The version shown at the screening was the edited one, right? I’m bound by a non-disclosure agreement, but I just want to see it now!]
 

 
[Someone, please knock me out with a punch so that when I wake up, I can watch ‘Neverland Girl’! qaq]
 

 
[Stop talking about it, the trailer's out! Everyone, hurry and go watch it! Check the homepage of the movie theater! Go watch it now!]
 

 
A week before the release, the carefully crafted trailer, riding on this wave of publicity, entered the sight of countless netizens.
# Chapter112
"I don't want to grow up."
 

 
"Then always be our little one. Stay with us and never leave."
 

 
The trailer begins with young Zhao curled up on her mother’s lap. Soft golden light from the setting sun filters through the window, enveloping the mother and daughter in a warm glow. Little Zhao's chubby, porcelain-like cheeks look as though they're draped in a layer of golden gauze, her bright, almond-shaped eyes reflecting crescent-shaped highlights.
 

 
The child version of Tong Zhao is one of the movie’s promotional highlights. Though her appearances in the film are brief, the trailer generously showcases her adorable moments. Usually, such childhood roles are portrayed by child actors, but even without promotional material, the familiar almond-shaped eyes, delicate features, and expressive brows make it clear—this is Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Who could have imagined young Tong Zhao would be this cute?
 

 
Is such an adorable child even real?
 

 
Miniature Tong Zhao looks like a meticulously crafted BJD doll, with her long, thick eyelashes framing her clear, bright eyes. Her slightly chubby cheeks, arms, and legs hint at a well-fed childhood, giving her a soft, clumsy charm.
 

 
Comment sections erupted, claiming these childhood scenes might be the only time audiences will see Tong Zhao with even a hint of baby fat—after all, she’s famous for her disciplined physique.
 

 
[I always imagined young Tong Zhao as a cold, noble young lady… Turns out she was this adorable? Rolling onto the play mat and tumbling over herself? I’m melting!]
 

 
[One of life’s great mysteries: How could that scumbag dad bear to hurt this angel of a child?]
 

 
[The scumbag dad can rot! From now on, we are all officially Tong Zhao's dad fans!]
 

 
[Your announcement is officially approved.]
 

 
The scene shifts to an exchange of messages between the male and female leads. When the camera focuses on Tong Zhao, the soundtrack features lighthearted piano notes, perfectly timed with each line of dialogue. However, when the focus shifts to Han Zhi, the music changes to deeper, more somber drum beats.
 

 
In visual storytelling, background music is an integral part of conveying emotion and narrative information.
 

 
On one side is unreserved sincerity, and on the other is a calculated probe cloaked in mystery.
 

 
—Is this the classic "bad boy and princess" trope?
 

 
The trailer’s editing subtly plants this idea in the audience's mind.
 

 
In the preview, Han Zhi sheds his usual refined style of button-ups, casual suits, and trench coats. Instead, his entrance features a trendy, rebellious outfit. His black hair, styled with a light mist of setting spray, is slightly tousled for an effortlessly cool look, with a strand of fringe falling over his left eye to accentuate his face shape. Whoever styled this deserves applause—they managed to transform a suave man in his late twenties into a smoldering “boy-next-door” in his early twenties. His playful smirk at the computer screen has female viewers collectively swooning.
 

 
"Damn, just for this look, I ‘have’ to see this in theaters!"
 

 
The trailer swiftly transitions into a montage explaining the plot's twist—accidental amnesia.
 

 
The heavy beats of a drum accompany a job posting seeking medical help as it spreads online. A mouse clicks, and the next scene reveals Han Zhi presenting himself formally to the female lead's parents. He's wearing silver-rimmed glasses, exuding a dependable yet subtly roguish charm—a "cultured bad boy" persona.
 

 
It’s a look audiences are familiar with, but the vibe is entirely different this time.
 
It’s mischievous. It’s magnetic.
 

 
—"You don’t remember me?"
 

 
—"I think I’ve dreamed of you… but it feels like I’m always dreaming now."
 

 
—"What’s your dream like?"
 

 
As Han Zhi gazes at Tong Zhao, the question drops. The camera zooms sharply into her clear, bright eyes, then quickly pans out to reveal a whimsical, dreamlike mansion, setting a surreal and magical tone.
 

 
"What’s it like to pamper your girlfriend into being a child?"
 
"I didn’t spoil her like this, thanks."
 

 
Though the white text claims, "I didn’t spoil her," the clips contradict him. Han Zhi is shown peeling an orange for her, adjusting her inner sleeve after helping her into her jacket, and more.
 

 
—"I’m not dating a bratty kid."
 

 
The music abruptly stops as Han Zhi twirls an automatic pencil between his fingers and lightly taps Tong Zhao on the forehead. Startled, she instinctively covers her head like a flustered little hamster, perfectly mirroring the earlier scene where young Zhao does the same. The identical expressions cleverly reinforce the "soul reverting to childhood" premise.
 

 
With a childlike mind, Tong Zhao forgets her online romance with Han Zhi but feels a strange sense of warmth and reliance on him. Often, she wonders who he really is. In essence, she falls for him all over again as a child—classic romance storytelling where, no matter the identity or timeline, love always finds a way.
 

 
Following a crescendo of fast-paced drum beats, two lines of text appear on screen:
 

 
"I never thought I'd become the reason a brat doesn't want to grow up."
 

 
As the final drumbeat fades, a recording plays the line, "But the one I love is Sylia." Tong Zhao clenches the recorder in her hand, rises, and rushes out to stop him from leaving.
 

 
The dreamlike mansion splits along the line of her body, transitioning back to its original, ordinary appearance.
 

 
Piece by piece, the fairytale dissolves into reality.
 

 
The female lead regains her memories.
 

 
The dream ends.
 

 
And the boy’s departure becomes the catalyst for the once-little girl who wanted to stay in "Neverland" forever to finally grow up.
 

 
The trailer didn’t reveal the ending.
 

 
Would the two protagonists reunite?
 

 
This question sparked heated debates in the comments section. Supporters of a happy ending argued persuasively that romance films no longer rely on tragic conclusions to draw tears; feel-good, happily-ever-after endings are now the norm.
 

 
On the other hand, proponents of a tragic ending also had a solid case:
 

 
[The director is Shi Qianqiu!]
 

 
Shi, nicknamed “Old Trickster,” is infamous for crafting stories that leave audiences bawling their eyes out—then allegedly hiding under a blanket to chuckle at their misery.
 

 
Of course, no one has actually witnessed him laughing under a blanket, but countless viewers traumatized by his previous works are firmly convinced of this legend.
 

 
The trailer was beautifully shot, exceeding all expectations. Combined with the breathtaking visuals of the lead actors, the comments section was flooded not just with plot discussions but also with girls tagging their boyfriends, dropping hints about wanting to watch it together.
 

 
The trailer’s share count stood out, thanks largely to Han Zhi’s fans driving up the numbers.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always discouraged her fans from becoming “data laborers.” She once posted on Weibo, asking them not to do this because it wasn’t necessary. She emphasized that there are many ways to express one’s support. While generating data isn’t illegal and doesn’t seem to harm anyone (aside from putting stress on Sina’s servers), she values her fans’ time and doesn’t want them wasting it on meaningless tasks.
 

 
Her stance has led to her having relatively “modest” data compared to her popularity. However, when it comes to "dehydrated" (authentic) engagement metrics, her numbers are consistently impressive—a fact widely recognized within the industry.
 

 
Interestingly, Han Zhi’s fans are usually laid-back and don’t engage in data wars either.
 

 
So why the exception this time?
 

 
—This was Han Zhi’s long-anticipated debut in a film!
 

 
Hints about his involvement had appeared during his previous live streams, though fans didn’t think he’d take on an acting role. They assumed it was related to Tong Zhao’s work, perhaps as a behind-the-scenes contribution. When word spread within the industry that Han Zhi would play the male lead, even notable film critics were skeptical.
 

 
But the trial screening turned out to be a surprising success!
 

 
When the trailer was released, it caused an uproar.
 

 
Fans treated it like a festive group activity, happily rallying together.
 

 
Once in a while, breaking their usual chill wasn’t embarrassing at all.
 

 
Many fans also wanted to make sure the company knew that Han Zhi still had active supporters. If opportunities like this arose again, they hoped their “Gege” would be considered. The shares were filled with heartfelt confessions:
 

 
[I’m so touched. Turns out the company hasn’t forgotten about Han Zhi.]
 

 
[Shoutout to my Brother—this self-love dynamic in the film is just chef’s kiss!]
 

 
[Self-love duo confirmed real (szd)]
 

 
[Han Zhi's new look—I’m in love! So youthful! Can this model be used in his livestreams? Someone write a petition for the wolf-boy version of Han Zhi!]
 

 
[Count me in for the petition. +1]
 

 
Since Han Zhi and Tong Zhao are essentially the same person, there’s no room for a real “couple” dynamic, which allows his girlfriend fans to swoon without any guilt.
 

 
The concept of one actor playing both male and female leads has been a trending topic, staying in the top six on social media for an extended period.
 

 
After all, it’s a first in the era of fully virtual films.
 

 
This level of buzz has other movies competing for attention turning green with envy. The movie has hit the ground running with immense popularity, and the related topics are flooded with praise. Fans debate whether Han Zhi and Tong Zhao have better chemistry or if it’s Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, reviving old rumors about the actress and director.
 

 
Don’t ask—when in doubt, ‘all ships are welcome in the harem’.
 

 
Other production teams have been tempted to replicate the success story of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
But then they look at their directors’ faces…
 

 
Appearance is secondary. Most directors working on rival projects are already married with families. Any rumored entanglements with the lead actors would become scandals rather than buzz-worthy gossip. Lacking similar ingredients, they can only grit their teeth and grumble that Shi Qianqiu is shameless for creating hype by fueling relationship rumors.
 

 
That same day, Jiang Dang posted a short video on Weibo:
 

 
@JiangDangV:
 

 
‘Singing a song.’
 

 
[Video]
 

 
In the video, Jiang Dang plays a guitar and performs a seamless medley of three songs: ‘Obsession’, ‘I’m Fine’, and ‘Always So Quiet’. The selected lyrics include:
 

 
“My feelings for you are more than mere obsession.”
 
“I’m fine—after all, I’ve only ever been needed occasionally.”
 
“I’m fine—even in the cold, I only trust my coat.”
 
“It’s clearly a movie for three, but I never had a name.”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s raspy low voice delivered the melancholy lyrics as if he had experienced heartbreak a thousand times over.
 

 
The comments section exploded with questions:
 

 
[Did you just get dumped?]
 

 
Jiang Dang replied to one fan:
 

 
[Right on time.]
 

 
Right on time for what?
 

 
A quick glance at the timestamp: exactly midnight.
 

 
So that’s it—he’s just indulging in some classic ‘NetEase Cloud Depression’.
 

 
Similarly brooding is the production team behind ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, a romance film releasing at nearly the same time as ‘Neverland Girl’ and with a suspiciously similar theme.
 

 
Romantic films primarily target young couples, who often only watch one romance movie during a short timeframe. Once their demand is met, they’re unlikely to choose another unless the reviews are exceptional. Most will opt for a different genre entirely.
 

 
The overlapping release dates have caused no small amount of anxiety.
 

 
The most frustrated of all is ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ screenwriter Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Zhang has been an old rival of Shi Qianqiu (though it’s a one-sided rivalry, as Shi doesn’t even remember who Zhang is). His grudge traces back to 'Heartless Tribulation’, a project that somehow also led him to harbor resentment toward Tong Zhao. In his frustration, Zhang once wrote a critique titled “Tong Zhao: A Distorted Product of Audiences’ Overvaluation of Subconscious Novelty in the Era of Virtual Films.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even acknowledge his critique, let alone respond. Instead, she went on to shoot another critically and commercially successful action film, which Zhang perceived as a direct slap in the face (though Tong Zhao initially considered it but eventually forgot).
 

 
In short, with the release dates of his movie clashing with those of his two sworn rivals, Zhang Wenshi felt a mix of unease and determination to stage a comeback.
 

 
Fortunately, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had a decent budget, allowing for a strong promotional campaign.
 

 
In comparison, the competing production seemed a bit more frugal.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi thought back to how Shi Qianqiu’s movies were always known for their lavish spending. This, in his mind, was the biggest difference between them (again, a one-sided perception). After all, he didn’t have the same privileged background to support extravagant projects. Seeing that the rival production seemed underfunded, Zhang felt this might be his one and only chance to outshine Shi Qianqiu, and he was determined to seize it.
 

 
And Tong Zhao—she was still the villain on his personal blacklist!
 

 
With ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ pouring its heart into promotions, time seemed to fly, and soon, the day of its release arrived. The movie’s distributor had fought hard to secure an earlier launch, reasoning that even a one-day head start could give them an edge. After all, viewers who had already watched ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ might not feel like heading to the theater for another romance film.
 

 
All movie critics, box office predictors, and curious onlookers had their eyes glued to this holiday release window!
# Chapter113
Zhang Wenshi had everything planned out.
 

 
"Sweet Rendezvous" was set to premiere on Saturday, while "Neverland Girl" would follow on Sunday.
 

 
It was typical for couples, after a long workweek, to go on dates during the weekend. Watching a movie was a standard choice, wasn’t it? And "Sweet Rendezvous’" had solid production quality. It was a safe, conventional romance film designed to make audiences laugh, cry, and feel moved in all the right places. With a loyal fan base for the lead actors, many viewers were eagerly anticipating its release.
 

 
The male lead, Gu Zhisuo, was among the top-tier young actors of the moment. Debuting with a "cool and rebellious" persona, his role as the young heir in "Sweet Rendezvous" aligned perfectly with his public image.
 

 
Most people assumed this film would elevate Gu Zhisuo’s popularity and market value. After all, not everyone was as daring and adventurous as Tong Zhao, who chose projects that matched her unpredictable subconscious preferences. Gu Zhisuo played it safe and followed the traditional path to success.
 

 
The investors were cautious, but the "Sweet Rendezvous’" team felt confident. For a romance movie, they had invested heavily in production. They even managed to secure a slightly earlier release date, squeezing in ahead of "Neverland Girl".
 

 
Interestingly, though, while Gu Zhisuo’s team had worked hard to secure that early release, the team behind "Neverland Girl" seemed unbothered. Given Director Shi Qianqiu’s strong connections, not to mention his brother—a powerful and protective businessman—it would have been easy for them to push back. But instead, there was only silence.
 

 
Was it a lack of funds or sheer confidence?
 

 
Gu Zhisuo leaned toward the former.
 

 
When "Neverland Girl" was in its initial stages, Gu Zhisuo’s manager had reached out, expressing interest in the project. However, the producers implied that his asking price was too high. They didn’t explicitly say it, of course—such blunt negotiations could bruise egos—but the message was clear to anyone experienced in the industry. When Gu Zhisuo caught wind of this, he immediately lost interest.
 

 
Romance movies were a gamble when it came to box office success. "Neverland Girl" wasn’t some high-profile project aiming for awards—it was a small, scrappy production. His initial interest stemmed from Tong Zhao’s reputation for delivering box office hits, but not enough to lower his fee. Conveniently, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ offered a solid paycheck, so he took it instead. Given the overlapping release dates, he kept a casual eye on "Neverland Girl."
 

 
When he heard that the other production had received additional funding, he couldn’t help feeling slightly annoyed.
 

 
So they ‘did’ have the money—they just thought he wasn’t worth it?
 

 
Still, "Neverland Girl" had turned him down politely, and Gu Zhisuo wasn’t the type to hold a grudge over a missed deal. He had no intention of sabotaging their production.
 

 
However, hearing about ‘Neverland Girl’ additional funding stirred something in Gu Zhisuo. It wasn't outright anger, but more like a small thorn in his pride. Clearly, the issue wasn’t their inability to pay—it was that they didn’t think he was worth his fee.
 

 
Still, professionalism reigned. Gu Zhisuo had a solid reputation and wasn’t the type to stoop to petty antics over a declined offer. Instead, his focus remained on ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. With its superior budget, polished production, and early release, it seemed poised for success.
 

 
But curiosity lingered. ‘Neverland Girl’ had been quietly moving forward, and its lack of a flashy promotional campaign made it somewhat of an enigma. Gu Zhisuo couldn’t help but monitor its progress.
 

 
The day before ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ release, news broke about ‘Neverland Girl’ cast and themes trending online. A small corner of the entertainment industry buzzed about the film’s unique angle—Tong Zhao playing two lead roles, one male and one female. It was an unprecedented move in modern cinema, drawing immense interest.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo raised an eyebrow when he read the headlines. Was this what they’d poured their funding into? A dual-role gimmick?
 

 
His manager chimed in, sharing the same skepticism. “It’s a risky play. Romance movies usually stick to tried-and-true formulas. All this subconscious, dreamlike narrative stuff might alienate audiences. And let’s not forget Tong Zhao’s eccentric streak—she thrives on pushing boundaries, but it doesn’t always resonate.”
 

 
Gu Zhisuo nodded in agreement. “They’re betting on shock value, but safe storytelling is what wins hearts. Our film has broader appeal.”
 

 
Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the competition was creeping closer. He reassured himself with one comforting thought—’Sweet Rendezvous’ had secured the early release date.
 

 
That extra day could make all the difference.
 

 
For the production team of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, the weekend’s battle felt like a high-stakes game. All eyes were on Saturday. If audiences loved their film, they’d dominate the romantic genre slot, leaving ‘Neverland Girl’ with crumbs. If reception was lukewarm, the head start might not be enough to hold their ground.
 

 
Meanwhile, as the promotional campaigns hit full swing, moviegoers on social media began splitting into camps. Fans of Gu Zhisuo declared their loyalty, gushing over his on-screen charisma. Tong Zhao’s fan base remained quieter but deeply devoted, hyping up her daring choice to take on such a complex project.
 

 
By Friday night, hashtags for both films trended on Weibo. The stage was set for a cinematic showdown.
 

 
It wasn’t a grudge, not even a proper rivalry—just a small matter that Gu Zhisuo kept in mind. Secretly, he hoped ‘Neverland Girl’ wouldn’t perform as well as ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. That way, he could proudly spin the narrative into a story about his “sharp judgment,” his ability to “choose the right projects,” and proof that “he’s worth every penny.”
 

 
The early reviews for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had been decent.
 

 
Screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, ever the tactician, analyzed the situation in their group chat, saying the two films were of similar quality. There was no need to downplay their own efforts or overly hype the competition. If both films had an equal 50/50 chance of success, their stronger financial backing would tip the scales in their favor when it came to marketing.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo liked this perspective. It reassured him that he had made the right choice—not that ‘Neverland Girl’ had rejected him, but rather that it didn’t deserve him.
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
These three words became a rallying cry for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, a confidence boost that carried them through the final days leading up to the premiere. Judging by the frequent mentions of “50/50” in their group chat, an outsider might have thought it was a fan group for a controversial livestreamer.
 

 
When ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ hit theaters, it delivered exactly what the team expected: a moderate success. The opening day’s box office just barely broke the 10-million mark—enough to recover costs and ensure a profit. However, with its Saturday release, this peak day would likely be the highest point of its earnings, and the numbers were expected to decline steadily after that.
 

 
Sunday would bring ‘Neverland Girl’ debut, and any hopes of a box office spike on Monday seemed unrealistic.
 

 
In recent years, for a romance movie to surpass 10 million on its first day was no small feat. For the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, this performance—paired with its stable 7/10 rating from critics—was a relief. Many of them had been worried that Tong Zhao, a box office powerhouse, would crush their movie entirely. Now, with a solid start under their belts, the cast and crew threw themselves even more enthusiastically into roadshows and promotional events.
 

 
There was even decent buzz surrounding the film. Several streamers hosted holographic “watch parties” for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, with enough participants to make a noticeable impact.
 

 
But then Sunday came.
 

 
And everything changed.
 

 
Here’s what started appearing across platforms:
 

 
- “[Movie Night with HaiYe] Neverland Girl Premiere Watch Party”
 

 
- “[Tsundere Princess’s Film Picks] Hmph, it’s not like I ‘want’ you to join me or anything!”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: For Those Who Know, You Know”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: Exclusive Screening for Han Zhi Fans (Sorry, No Male Fans Allowed)”
 

 
At first, it was just a handful of streamers. But every refresh brought new watch party announcements, and soon, the first ten pages of trending streams were completely dominated by ‘Neverland Girl’. Even lesser-known streamers jumped on the bandwagon, eager to host synchronized screenings.
 

 
Holographic live streams worked as a ticketed event, meaning viewers paid to watch the movie while streamers earned a share of the tips and ad revenue. A significant portion of these earnings also went to the film studio.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, the number of live-streamed watch parties for a new movie often served as a reliable indicator of its popularity. And ‘Neverland Girl’? It was absolutely exploding.
 

 
The jokes and memes born from live streams often spread further and boost a movie’s popularity—a win-win commercial strategy.
 

 
Some fan group leaders even organized exclusive watch parties, requiring fan membership verification to join. This effectively created distinct fan spaces, where everyone could enjoy the movie their own way without interfering with others.
 

 
Even streamers who had been broadcasting unrelated content caught wind of the hype in the movie streaming zone. After investigating the buzz, many decided to join the trend. One of them was Hai Laoshi, a small-time streamer with the philosophy of “no shame in making money.” At the time, he was lazily streaming PUBG. However, when a friend mentioned the frenzy around ‘Neverland Girl’, he immediately tossed a grenade in-game to kill himself and exited the session:
 

 
“Hey everyone, I’ve been a loyal fan of Tong Zhao for ten years. I’ve been looking forward to this movie all week. If you don’t mind pitching in for a ticket, let’s watch it together!”
 

 
“After all, I was just streaming a shooting game, and Tong Zhao’s got great aim too. It’s all connected!”
 

 
[“Tong Zhao hasn’t even been in the industry for ten years.”]
 
[“How on earth is a romance film connected to shooting skills? This is the most hilariously shameless attempt at trend-jumping I’ve ever seen.”]
 
[“Classic Hai Laoshi—using his thick skin as bulletproof armor!”]
 

 
As a relatively obscure streamer, Hai Laoshi didn’t have many followers. This was precisely why he jumped on the hype train, hoping to gain some new viewers.
 

 
He quickly navigated to the movie streaming section, but to his dismay, the option to stream ‘Neverland Girl’, which had just been released that day, was grayed out.
 

 
Unconvinced, he clicked repeatedly.
 

 
Nothing happened.
 

 
“What the heck? Is the server down?”
 

 
This issue wasn’t unique to Hai Laoshi; similar problems were cropping up across the platform.
 

 
The platform’s response was swift. They issued a site-wide announcement: ‘Due to excessive demand, the large number of viewing rooms for ‘Neverland Girl’ has overwhelmed the servers. Streaming rooms for this movie are temporarily restricted to gold-level streamers or higher (current streams are not affected).
 

 
Creating a streaming room wasn’t difficult, and some users had specifically signed up as streamers just to host watch parties with their friends. This wasn’t an unprecedented occurrence. In the past, when highly anticipated blockbusters were released, the platform would preemptively set restrictions on streaming to prevent server overload, encouraging users to visit holographic cinemas for group viewings instead. For example, during the release of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, such measures had been implemented early on, avoiding any last-minute chaos.
 

 
But those were big-budget, effects-heavy blockbusters.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’, on the other hand, was an artistic romance film.
 

 
This level of demand? Unbelievable.
 

 
Hai Laoshi’s shocked expression was so over-the-top that one of his loyal fans recorded it. Later, it was included in a compilation of streamers reacting to the ‘Neverland Girl’ phenomenon. His exaggerated, near-eye-popping expression ended up earning him unexpected attention.
 

 
But that’s a story for another time.

# ‘Neverland Girl’ Faces Traffic Limits? The Largest Holographic Movie Platform Can't Handle It! #
 

 
No need to buy trending searches; the buzz is already here.
 

 
Aside from those who can go out to the theater with friends or lovers, and the regular moviegoers, there are also those who, on holidays, prefer to put on their holographic headsets and watch movies at home. These groups have all noticed the explosive popularity of ‘Neverland Girl’, which has become overwhelming. People are herd animals, so movies that are often both heavily criticized and praised by many tend to achieve good box office results through the same crowd mentality.
 

 
Bilibili video creators are complaining, Weibo’s homepage is filled with complaints, and coworkers, classmates, and friends are all trash-talking the movie—don’t you have to buy a ticket to see how bad it really is?
 

 
In this era of rising ticket prices, there are fewer films that use their bad reputation as a marketing tactic.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’ has generated a lot of heat, but is it good or bad?
 

 
The first batch of viewers hasn’t even spoken out yet!
 

 
Before, critics were saying it was great.
 

 
But for the general public, no one really knows whether it's good or bad.
 

 
However, its popularity must have a reason. Moreover, it stars Tong Zhao... People who have seen her previous movies, TV shows, and variety shows know she’s good, so it shouldn’t be boring, right? With this fanbase and the buzz around ‘the first film in 'Instinctive Cinema’ history to feature a single actor playing all the lead roles*, countless viewers hopped on the bandwagon, leading even more people into the theaters.
 

 
By Sunday afternoon, its box office had already surpassed Saturday’s ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ for the entire day.
 

 
What’s even scarier is that on Sunday, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ saw a drastic drop in its box office, well below expectations. Normally, a slight drop on the second day is expected, and with Sunday’s factors, the most optimistic forecast would be a small increase. The ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew had still held onto their “50-50” hope, thinking a slight decline was acceptable.
 

 
A piece of bad news hit the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
Not only did it drop, but it plummeted.
 

 
It crashed straight into the water with no splash, and no one cared.
 

 
Aside from Gu Zhisu’s fans and a few viewers who saw ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ yesterday and liked it, everyone else was discussing ‘Neverland Girl’ dominance on the charts and the impressive feat of almost crashing the movie platform’s servers.
 

 
This Sunday was destined to be a black day for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
The days before the movie release should have been the harvest phase for the whole crew’s hard work—brushing ticket sales, sharing glowing reviews, and reading ratings on review sites… but since the box office stats came out this afternoon, the group chat went completely silent, as if everyone had died.
 

 
After a while, the director broke the silence:
 

 
[“Have you seen the box office?”]
 

 
[“Mm...”]
 

 
[“Sigh, it’s normal since the neighbor had the first day; if the reviews are good, we’ll be fine later. Our quality is still solid.”]
 

 
Although there were words of comfort, the overall atmosphere in the group was still downcast.
 

 
The assistant director thought of Gu Zhisu and @-ed him in the group, jokingly suggesting, [“There’s nothing we can do, maybe let Zhisu do some promotion?”]
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s salary made up a significant portion of the production costs.
 

 
The investors were counting on him to carry the box office.
 

 
After all, his data on Weibo was very high, and among the new generation of popular stars, he was considered one of the most capable. He could encourage his fans, saying that one ticket per person wasn’t enough; they could buy multiple tickets or even buy them as gifts for others.
 

 
Gu Zhisu: [“Of course, I’m already thinking of a Weibo post. [Sunglasses Cat Head nodding wildly.jpg]”]
 

 
With his guarantee, the atmosphere in the WeChat group began to pick up a bit…
 

 
That sunglasses cat head was quite cute.
 

 
However, Gu Zhisu, holding his phone, had a handsome face with sharp brows and bright eyes, but his expression was as dark as the bottom of a pot. His persona was that of a pampered young master, but right now, his face looked like that of a rich second generation who had cruised through life relying on his only-child status for twenty years, only to discover that the government had implemented a two-child policy, and his mother quickly got pregnant and gave birth to a younger brother.
 

 
He was distressed.
 

 
These people didn’t understand the life of a traffic star.
 

 
The core fanbase, who were the most willing to spend and would go to great lengths for him, had already done all of the above without needing his promotion. What did that mean? It meant that the box office he could carry was limited—no more than that, and squeezing more out would only be a drop in the bucket.
 

 
Gu Zhisu had nothing left to give.
 

 
But he couldn’t tell them the truth. All he could do was come up with a sensational Weibo post to stir up his fans and squeeze out whatever remaining value he could from his loyal followers...
 

 
A little while later, a heartfelt Weibo post was born.
 

 
@Gu Zhisu v:
 

 
On this special day, there are so many things I want to say to you. My manager always tells me that the more I talk, the more I get into trouble, that I should say less. But I don’t care about that! I’m Duan Jia’s young master who’s not afraid of anything, and I want more people to see me play Duan Xinghe.
 

 
He then commented on this post: [Did you see Duan Xinghe?]
 

 
Fans immediately broke down in tears.
 

 
[Yes, yes! I not only want to see it myself, but I want everyone to see the best Duan Xinghe in the world, my favorite Zhisu!]
 

 
[Baby, you were great, really! Don’t let the outside noise affect you, okay?]
 

 
[Third time watching ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, still want to recommend it to more people!]
 

 
In just an hour, the post had been shared over ten thousand times.
 

 
The number of shares on Weibo sharply contrasted with the slow growth of the movie’s box office.
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s fans had worked hard.
 

 
But there was only so much money to be squeezed from his fans. In the box office for instinctive films, the traffic seemed like beautiful bubbles. When the box office was good, fans could help boost it higher, but expecting them to turn mediocrity into something magical? That was impossible.
 

 
Gu Zhisu understood that as well.
 

 
The Weibo post mobilizing the fans to feel the pain was also his way of doing his part and leaving the rest to fate, not wanting the production team to think he was collecting money without delivering results.
 

 
...
 

 
When the fans saw their beloved star feeling down, they immediately took the initiative to do some reading comprehension to figure out why he was upset. The reason was easy to understand—the box office data was publicly available and could be checked at any time.
 

 
Once they checked, the already broken defenses were further shattered by the harsh reality.
 

 
How could the comparison be so brutal?
 

 
They couldn’t understand.
 

 
Sweet Rendezvous’s promotion was actually quite strong, so much so that fans rarely praised the official team.
 

 
It’s a miracle considering how often fans curse out the official team, company, or agents. Clearly, the promotion for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ was heartfelt, with a heavy focus on Gu Zhisu, which greatly pleased his fans.
 

 
Why did the box office plummet so drastically on the second day?
 

 
Both Weibo and entertainment forums were buzzing with discussions.
 

 
The answer was simple.
 

 
Because ‘Neverland Girl’ exploded.
# Chapter114
The market is like a cake.
 

 
It’s not some fair and just “grandpa divides the pork” scenario where everyone gets an equal share. If someone takes a bigger slice, others inevitably get less. Films released during the same period are already competitors, especially if they’re in the same genre. Bad luck for one means good luck for the other. That’s why people say making a movie is like high-stakes gambling. If someone makes a decent film that scores a 60, but it comes out alongside a 90-point blockbuster, then too bad—audiences only have so much money to spend on movies. Once they’ve seen the higher-rated one, they likely won’t have the budget for the just-passable one.
 

 
Unless your film is so outstanding that it makes audiences dig deeper into their wallets for an additional ticket after watching the first one.
 

 
But ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ wasn’t good enough to expand the size of the cake.
 

 
Speaking of “grandpa divides the pork,” this seemingly fair and just idiom doesn’t actually include everyone—“everyone” usually excludes women and refers only to men. Life is full of visible and invisible competition. Everyone wants to win. From the investors and directors to the backstage crew of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, when they looked at the success of their rivals, their collective thought was: ‘Why couldn’t we be the ones taking the entire cake for this genre?’
 

 
If given the choice, everyone wants to be the winner.
 

 
---
 

 
“Anyone here who’s seen both? Can you explain the difference? Is Tong Zhao really that good?”
 

 
Some observant viewers noticed that when people discuss ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ they tend to refer to it by its title. But when it comes to ‘Neverland Girl’ they directly say Tong Zhao’s name or simply call it “the five-character movie.”
 

 
Is it because the movie’s title is too clunky, or is it that Tong Zhao truly carries the entire film?
 

 
Perhaps both.
 

 
Either way, the five-character movie has been deeply branded with Tong Zhao’s name.
 

 
If it flops, her myth will fall. If it succeeds, her reputation will be further gilded.
 

 
Whenever Tong Zhao has a new movie, the focus of discussions—whether among audiences or the media—is always her.
 

 
At some point, Tong Zhao’s success became a matter of course. Perhaps because there’s no real comparison point anymore.
 

 
No one has such a uniquely diverse subconscious. Imagine if you had three different styles or personas, but none of them were charming, distinctive, or capable—what good would it do? But Tong Zhao is extraordinarily gifted. Every time she pulls out a new persona from the depths of her repertoire, it’s incredibly captivating.
 

 
How can I describe it?
 

 
In the realm of instinct-driven films, when others become successful, it’s like a gift from the heavens—a stroke of luck. But for Tong Zhao, it’s as if the heavens prepared a full-course meal of three dishes and a soup, chasing after her to feed her, stuffing her with food. ‘Eat, eat to your heart’s content! Once you’ve finished these three dishes, dessert is waiting for you. Don’t hold back—this feast is endless!’
 

 
---
 

 
"Actually, I think ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is pretty good. GZS is really unlucky."*
 

 
"Shocking my entire village—are same-genre movies this competitive now?"
 

 
[Uh, OP, don’t misuse new buzzwords you just learned. “Involution” isn’t the right term here.]
 

 
[Movies released at the same time are competitors, and for those in the same genre, it’s even more cutthroat—it’s survival of the fittest. Besides, wasn’t the four-character film more hyped before? Fans of that movie made a huge fuss, but in the end, it couldn’t compare to a single woman carrying the box office.]
 

 
[Please don’t drag GZS into this, thank you. Respect women, please. Our side has always respected senior figures and never claimed to surpass them.]
 

 
After all that discussion, the conclusion is...
 

 
The difference between the two movies lies in Tong Zhao.
 

 
It’s not just vague impressions either. If you break it down with data and discussions, the spotlight is always on Tong Zhao and director Han. That’s proof that she’s carrying the entire film. The fact that she played two roles in one movie also piqued audience curiosity—something they’ve rarely, if ever, seen before.
 

 
Audiences aren’t particularly profound or nuanced as a group. Sometimes, getting them to buy tickets is remarkably simple.
 

 
It could be the movie features a cruel, unprecedented torture scene left entirely uncut.
 

 
It could be a major star, usually burdened by their pristine idol image, baring it all—man or woman, doesn’t matter. Even if it’s just a glimpse of their backside, it might draw enough attention to crush same-genre competition.
 

 
Is it unfair competition when it comes to Tong Zhao?
 

 
Professional doctors have pointed out that what she does imposes a heavy burden on her brain. For most actors, finishing such instinct-driven films leaves them mentally drained for days. But for Tong Zhao, the effects might last even longer. Fans have expressed concern, with some angrily accusing her agency of overworking her for profits. The agency explained that Tong Zhao has undergone specialized brain training for these roles.
 

 
Other actors don’t require such training because they don’t have such diverse subconscious capabilities.
 

 
But this only proves one thing: Tong Zhao has worked hard.
 

 
Fairness aside, she ‘deserves’ her success.
 

 
---
 

 
Sunday’s premiere of ‘Neverland Girl’ was the peak of Tong Zhao’s praise.
 

 
Most of the first wave of viewers bought tickets solely because of her.
 

 
The remaining motivations were scattered: “Critics said it’s decent,” “Sunday’s my only day off,” or “The plot summary looks interesting.”
 

 
Of course, what happens next is anyone’s guess.
 

 
Many in the industry didn’t expect ‘ Neverland Girl’ to dominate so overwhelmingly, and some even started to feel a little sympathy for ‘Sweet Rendezvous.’
 

 
“Did ‘Neverland Girl' have any major promotional campaigns? Not really. I didn’t see Tong Zhao on any variety shows this month. Even the trailer—I only came across it online. That proves the film didn’t have much of a promotional budget. Its box office pressure was even lighter than ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ simply because it had Tong Zhao. With her, they achieved low investment and high returns.”
 

 
“Never thought I’d see the day when Director Shi’s film was this strapped for cash.”
 

 
“Hahaha, but with such strong opening day box office numbers, surely they’ll start promoting it more? Who doesn’t want more money? I heard Tong Zhao fully funded this film herself. I can’t even imagine how much she’s making.”
 

 
“In the internet age, it’s all about creating buzz.”
 

 
“In comparison, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ feels too plain. Even the male lead doesn’t have the same charisma as Han Zhi…”
 

 
The last comment, posted by a film critic on Weibo, struck a nerve with Gu Zhisu’s fans, nearly sparking an online argument.
 

 
Fortunately, the critic’s friends quickly pointed out that saying such things would be seen as “stepping on others” in today’s youth culture. It would provoke backlash, both by drawing hate toward Han Zhi and offending Gu Zhisu’s fans, leaving the critic with nothing but insults in return. Realizing this, the critic deleted the post almost immediately, preventing any major conflict.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, meanwhile, were oblivious to this drama—they were busy doing something more productive.
 

 
What exactly?
 

 
Urging the official ‘Neverland Girl’ social media account to step up their promotional efforts. They insisted the team start booking variety shows, stop slacking, and stop being stingy. After all, with such promising box office trends, the film was bound to make a huge profit.
 

 
If it were another film, fans might scold the production team for being so tightfisted and indifferent to their idol. But when it came to this movie, the tone was completely different.
 

 
Here’s the emotional journey of the fans:
 

 
First: “Stupid stingy team! Are you neglecting my precious baby? Treat Zhao Zhao and Director Han better!”
 

 
Then: “Wait a minute... the main investor ‘is’ my baby.”
 

 
Finally, the fans turned to humor and started making memes. A giant stick figure sprawled on the ground, begging the official account to put more effort into promotions. Beside it was a tiny stick figure with a pacifier in its mouth asking, “Snacks? What snacks are there to eat?”
 

 
Their cheerful attitude was so unusual it went viral. The meme-filled comment section became another hot topic of discussion.
 

 
Confused onlookers chimed in:
 

 
“This pacifier meme doesn’t match Tong Zhao’s image. Feels out of character. Wouldn’t it make more sense if Zhao Jie was holding a cigarette?”
 

 
Which other actress gives people the impression of puffing on a cigarette? The internet burst into laughter.
 

 
When first-day viewers saw the film, they added:
 

 
“Just watched Tong Zhao’s new movie. Sister Zhao has turned into Zhao Bao ( treasure or precious Zhao).”
 

 
Turned into Zhao Bao?
 

 
If you said Tong Zhao was dominating the screen, cutting down enemies left and right, audiences would be used to it. But if you said she became a childlike character in the movie—that’s something worth talking about.
 

 
By Sunday, audience reviews and impressions of the films gradually entered the public eye.
 

 
As more people watched the films, the number of discussion points grew.
 

 
Romance films typically target couples and female audiences. For example, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ marketed itself from the title onward, encouraging women to “bring your boyfriend for a sweet date.” In contrast, the title of the neighboring film (Neverland Girl) leaned into a more artsy and abstract vibe. Yet, despite its lack of overt appeal, the latter blew up—and with good reason.
 

 
If ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is characterized by steadiness, ‘Neverland Girl’ is defined by boldness.
 

 
Once the film was officially released, some short clips inevitably began circulating online.
 

 
Although this technically counts as copyright infringement, the production team usually turns a blind eye. After all, to truly experience the immersive visuals and atmosphere, audiences still need to buy tickets for the holographic version. These leaked clips act as free publicity, saving the studio even more promotional expenses—much to their delight.
 

 
Interestingly, the focus of these viral clips was no longer solely on Tong Zhao but shifted to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
So, what’s the story here?
 

 
Under the dual pressure from both the movie’s fans and Tong Zhao’s fans, the production team finally agreed to appear on a talk show for promotional purposes.
 

 
And when they finally showed up, they went big, choosing the hottest and most tightly scheduled program of the moment, ‘Let’s Start Shooting!’
 

 
The show primarily invites stars with recent works to chat casually in a relaxed atmosphere. However, the title of the program has a different connotation in Cantonese, where "start shooting" (kaai pin) colloquially means “start a brawl.” Perhaps the name was fitting, as the host, Xue Yutang, was famous for his daring and sometimes provocative questions. Early on, some guests struggled to respond to his sharp commentary, occasionally finding themselves at a loss. Over time, only the most thick-skinned or playful celebrities dared to appear on the show, which in turn boosted its entertainment value immensely.
 

 
Once the ratings climbed, even those who initially avoided the show found themselves willing to participate.
 

 
The guests representing ‘ Neverland Girl' were Shi Qianqiu, Qian Rui, and Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Today, we have three guests, though calling it four wouldn’t be unreasonable,” Xue Yutang teased as he introduced them.
 

 
“In fact, if the budget had allowed for this episode to be filmed in holographic format, I would’ve loved to invite the mysterious fourth guest.”
 

 
He let out an exaggerated sigh.
 

 
The live audience began murmuring, already guessing who he was referring to. After all, Han Zhi’s name had recently resurged in popularity due to the film’s buzz, becoming a trending topic once again.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned toward a particular direction in the studio and declared, “Let’s give a warm welcome to ‘Neverland Girl’’s writer-director, the lead actors, and the art director!”
 

 
The four sat in a semicircle, with Xue Yutang reclining on a personal sofa. In the center was a decorative coffee table.
 

 
Xue Yutang introduced the two behind-the-scenes crew members first.
 

 
“Oh, and speaking of the lead actor,” Xue Yutang added with a playful smirk, “if I didn’t clarify, everyone might assume Director Shi *is* the male lead!”
 

 
Xue Yutang wasn’t wrong.
 

 
Some members of the live audience, unfamiliar with Shi Qianqiu, took one look at his strikingly handsome face and instinctively assumed he was just another fresh-faced actor they couldn’t recognize. When they learned he was the director, recognition started dawning on some of them, recalling related news stories—after all, Shi’s face had gone viral before for his infamous line: *"If you want me to act as the male lead, that’s a whole different price tag."*
 

 
Tong Zhao chimed in with a laugh: “Director Shi isn’t cheap. Our production couldn’t afford him.”
 

 
Her remark brought laughter from both the host and the live audience.
 

 
The film crew’s tight budget became one of the key talking points of this episode.
 

 
“Still, when it comes to looks, the male lead, Han Zhi, has the edge,” Xue Yutang quipped, gesturing toward the screen.
 

 
Immediately, a large screen displayed highlight clips of Han Zhi from the movie, focusing on his most captivating moments. One scene, in particular, stood out: Han Zhi and Sylia caught in the rain in a garden. His white shirt, soaked and clinging to his body, revealed a perfect outline of his muscles. The rain blurred his glasses, obscuring his eyes until he reached up, took them off, and stared intensely at the camera. The silence in the scene was heavy with unspoken desire, like an overwhelming flood of Alpha energy crashing over the audience.
 

 
It was breathtaking.
 

 
The female audience members began to stir, visibly excited.
 

 
Seizing the moment, Xue Yutang offered a brief introduction to Han Zhi’s character. Naturally, he pivoted to one of the audience’s burning questions about Tong Zhao’s performance: playing two characters. Teasing her, Xue encouraged her to try embodying Han Zhi’s aura on the spot.
 

 
In the post-Instinct Film era, acting in the traditional sense was rare. But since she had tapped into Han Zhi’s subconscious for the movie, Xue reasoned, surely she could replicate at least 60–70% of his charisma in real life, right?
 

 
This playful challenge had clearly been pre-approved by the crew.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll give it a shot,” Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
Xue Yutang pretended to ponder for a moment. “Han Zhi’s other role, Nie Su, is quite the schemer, right? Let’s have Tong Zhao play Nie Su charming someone for a change. Hmm, but where are we going to find a ‘younger sister’ for her to flirt with? Director Shi, could you help us out?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu responded flatly: “No.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him. “Come on, play along. We’re here to promote the movie.”
 

 
Qian Rui chimed in, backing her up: “Think about the promotional budget—doesn’t it suddenly seem worth it?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu frowned, feigning reluctance before sighing in defeat. “Fine.”
 

 
The show’s staff quickly brought out props. Following Tong Zhao’s instructions, they handed her a long black trench coat and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses. She tied her long hair back, while the staff placed a black wig on Shi Qianqiu’s head.
 

 
The wig wasn’t properly adjusted and looked noticeably fake, but Shi Qianqiu’s striking features still stood out. His pale complexion and refined facial structure gave him a distinctive, elegant beauty—almost like a classic Chinese painting come to life.
 

 
“You’re stunning,” Tong Zhao complimented.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a sidelong glance.
 

 
A simple glance would have been unremarkable, but Shi couldn’t resist spicing things up. Adding a touch of flair, his gaze carried a hint of playful mischief and a tinge of vulnerability, as if silently saying “Won’t you pity me?” The effect was captivating enough to make the audience momentarily forget about the cheap wig perched on his head.
 

 
Unexpectedly roped into this scenario, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and called for Han Zhi to step in and play along.
 

 
Han Zhi: “...Wasn’t this supposed to be an interactive segment with a female guest from the audience?”
 

 
The idea of playing out a scene with another man left him reluctant, and he showed it plainly.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I think they said having Shi Qianqiu do it would be more effective. Just pretend he’s a girl!”
 

 
This made Han Zhi feel like a duck being herded onto a rack.
 

 
Not ‘that’ kind of duck.
 

 
The kind being forced into something against its will.
 

 
Despite his reservations, Han Zhi remained professional and slipped into the role of the primary persona. Onstage, he executed a suave sequence where he draped a trench coat over Shi Qianqiu’s shoulders, performing the classic “charming protector” move.
 

 
After wrapping the coat around him, Han Zhi paused, staring at him intently.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, slightly unnerved, asked, “What is it?”
 

 
Han Zhi let his gaze linger on Shi’s ear for a moment before answering:
 

 
"There’s snow on it."
 

 
With that, he reached out, as if to brush the imaginary snow away, his fingertip deliberately grazing the sensitive skin behind Shi’s ear.
 

 
Throughout the coat-draping part, Han Zhi had maintained a gentlemanly distance. Nobody had expected such a subtle yet provocative gesture to follow.
 

 
The fleeting touch was barely there, but the skin behind the ear was especially sensitive. Shi Qianqiu was completely unprepared and momentarily caught off guard by the move.
 

 
Looking at the audience, Han Zhi gave a charming smile and announced: “Alright, that’s the scene.”
 

 
Then he practically fled the stage, relinquishing the lead persona back to Tong Zhao as quickly as he could.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she was greeted by the sight of Shi Qianqiu sitting there, staring at her in utter disbelief, as if his innocence had just been stolen.
# Chapter115
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't forget that expression—an odd mix of shock, disdain, and a hint of contemplation.
 

 
The two of them, being sharp and experienced, quickly remembered they were filming a show. With a smile still lingering on her face, Tong Zhao returned to her seat and casually remarked, "Something like that... If I had applied a proper full-face makeup, it would look even more like a guy."
 

 
The people on and off stage treated her words as modesty.
 

 
Xue Yutang shook his head repeatedly, clearly impressed. "No, that was amazing. The character switch just now—it really felt like there was a man’s soul hiding inside you. And not just any man, but a total player and heartbreaker." Known for his sharp tongue, Xue gave her high praise with an uncharacteristically genuine tone, showing how thoroughly impressed he was. "Even if it were still the era of traditional films, your acting alone would guarantee you’d be a star!"
 

 
It was truly astonishing. If not for Tong Zhao's star power and professionalism preventing the host from treating her like a mere spectacle, Xue Yutang might have even asked her to perform again.
 

 
The fact remained: she was still the same person.
 

 
She only added a trench coat, with no changes to her styling or features. She didn’t even pull any exaggerated expressions. It was clear she wasn’t the theatrical type. Yet, in just the blink of an eye, her aura had transformed. Her interactions with Shi Qianqiu were entirely different from when she portrayed her female self, leaving everyone in awe.
 

 
"It's as if a completely different soul has taken over," Xue Yutang exclaimed with a chuckle. "If you told me you could summon spirits, I’d believe it."
 

 
---
 

 
Dan Ge: "Han Zhi, forever a legend!"
 
Chen Guifei: "Hahaha, I can’t! Shi Qianqiu’s expression just now was absolutely priceless!"
 

 
Han Zhi felt like he’d taken some serious emotional damage.
 

 
He was tainted. He was no longer pure.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Shi Qianqiu and asked, “What was it like for you?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pressed his temples and sighed dramatically, removing the wig in a way that evoked the tired resignation of a dancer removing her makeup after a grueling performance. “Promoting a movie is no joke… If the box office doesn’t shoot up by at least a hundred million, it’d be an insult to my worth.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked. “You certainly think highly of yourself.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gave her a fake smile. “Well, I’m pairing up with you for this, aren’t I? Your fans should at least do me the courtesy.”
 

 
“Would they really?” Xue Yutang cut in smoothly, teasing, “Should they start calling you ‘brother-in-law’ now?”
 

 
Recently, several celebrities had been exposed for having secret relationships, causing fan communities to implode under the weight of such revelations.
 

 
“It’s impossible. After watching the movie, they’d probably scold me for dating too young,” Tong Zhao joked. She then paused deliberately, pretending to realize something. “Wait, did I just spoil the plot?”
 

 
Qian Rui interjected at just the right moment, “It’s already mentioned in the synopsis, so it doesn’t count as a spoiler from Sister Zhao.”
 

 
Xue Yutang smoothed things over with a laugh, segueing into showing clips of Zhao Zai’s playful and clumsy moments on the big screen.
 

 
In the clip, Zhao Zai could be seen rolling, tripping, and smacking her head, only to freeze in stunned embarrassment before trying to escape back to her room. But Concubine Chen stopped her, dragged her back, and forced her to watch herself. It was almost as if the production team had a vendetta, carefully editing together every foolish moment: pouting over green peppers she didn’t want to eat, clutching a giant teddy bear in fear of the dark, sneaking into the male lead’s room at midnight...
 

 
The public humiliation left Zhao Zai looking like she’d been struck by lightning.
 

 
She couldn’t face the audience anymore!
 

 
She was officially the dumbest “Zai” on this street!
 

 
In the quick-transmigration arcs, Zhao Zai had always thought herself clever and heroic, successfully taming four future villains to the point they obeyed her like loyal disciples. They saw her as a future wife, but she viewed them like little brothers. Perhaps it was the first-person perspective that gave her the illusion of superiority. But now, watching herself from the third-person in this immersive film, she realized—
 

 
Good grief, she’d been a fool all along.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Zhao Zai spun in circles, mortified. Tong Zhao, amused, steered the conversation away as Xue Yutang praised her. “Adorable, definitely. But I didn’t expect Tong Zhao’s subconscious to have such an innocent side.”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because my previous roles gave off a tougher impression,” Tong Zhao replied thoughtfully. “But honestly, the female lead in my new movie has a tough side too. Comparatively, the male lead is actually the softer one.” She glanced at Shi Qianqiu. “Remember how we were rumored to have secret meetings? That was just us discussing the personalities of these two characters back then.”
 

 
“Exactly.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu picked up the thread effortlessly, returning to his usual composed demeanor. “One is strong because she’s pure; the other is gentle because he’s complicated. The most fascinating thing is how she can bring both characters to life. Sometimes, I seriously consider flipping her upside down and shaking her, just to see if I can shake out more interesting subconscious personalities.”
 

 
No one expected Shi Qianqiu to have such bold ambitions, nor that he’d be so unafraid of provoking fans.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Tong Zhao with a grin. “Are you afraid of him?”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed. “He can’t beat me. Who ties up who is still up for debate.”
 

 
“Watch your words,” Shi Qianqiu said, his scholarly fake smile perfectly in place. “I’d rather not see even more outrageous rumors about me trending online.”
 

 
At that moment, the director’s voice came in off-screen, gently reminding them, “Brother Xue, please treasure your show.”
 

 
That tone immediately reminded the young audience of the superadmin warnings issued to streamers who cross the line or share inappropriate content, urging them to "cherish your live stream." Laughter erupted across the scene.
 

 
Being the host of an interview show isn't easy. Asking questions that cross the line might offend the guests, but if the host is too cautious, worried about the guests' status, the audience will find it boring and stop watching, which is essentially sabotaging their own career. Before the show, Xue Yutang specifically asked both guests if there were any topics that should be avoided, so he could be more careful.
 

 
Both guests answered that there were no taboos and that anything could be discussed.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he decided not to bring up anything sensitive, and Xue Yutang immediately looked at Tong Zhao—currently the hottest rising star with an unmatched level of popularity—with newfound respect. He remembered hearing rumors from a previous food variety show that she had a tendency to be difficult and act aloof. But after meeting her in person, he realized it was all just gossip. She was very easygoing, and her rise to fame was well-deserved.
 

 
It wasn’t entirely a rumor though.
 

 
After all, the person appearing on the show was none other than the famous concubine.
 

 
The more beautiful someone is, the bigger their ego seems to be. Her airs were grand enough to match a lavish banquet.
 

 
As the atmosphere began to settle, Xue Yutang shifted to more in-depth questions.
 

 
He asked Tong Zhao about her experience with her first film investment, whether she encountered any interesting situations while collaborating with others, and how she got along with Shi Qianqiu. He also mentioned hearing that many male actors were rejected during the casting process and wondered if that was true.
 

 
These were all pieces of gossip the audience would be eager to hear.
 

 
Tong Zhao followed up, sharing a bit of gossip: “Because I had to portray the amnesia-stricken female lead, I needed to pull myself out of the filming process and switch to a completely different state of mind. During that time, the doctor advised me to take a break, so I went backstage and had afternoon tea with the crew.”
 

 
“And then?” Xue Yutang leaned forward, looking intrigued.
 

 
“When I was filming ‘Instinct’, I really got into the role, and my mindset was kind of like a child’s. I had discussed this with Director Shi beforehand. And then guess what happened? He came up to me and said…”
 

 
Tong Zhao mimicked Shi Qianqiu’s relaxed attitude, speaking with great seriousness:
 

 
“Do you know? There’s no such thing as Ultraman in this world.”
 

 
…
 

 
“It didn’t really work on her,” Shi Qianqiu said, shrugging. “When my little brother first started primary school, that line made him cry. He held onto that grievance for a whole week.”
 

 
Tong Zhao added, “He saw that Ultraman couldn’t hurt me, so he started talking about Santa Claus and made up a scary story. I wasn’t expecting it at all…”
 

 
She showed a slightly embarrassed expression as she recalled the moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu helped finish her story: “It scared her so much that she ended up hiccupping.”
 

 
The idea of Tong Zhao being scared to the point of hiccupping was hard to imagine at first. But after the recent clip of Zhao Zai aired, along with her soft and sweet smile, her gentle eyes that shone like precious jade, it was easy to imagine her having a cute and innocent aura. Looking back on the situation, Tong Zhao played along and puckered her lips as if she was embarrassed.
 

 
Usually, Sister Zhao presents herself as a cold and perfect image, but now, openly acting cute—what a hard worker!
 

 
As for the topic of the male lead in ‘Neverland Gir’, it was a very sensitive subject.
 

 
If the list of candidates were actually named, it would offend quite a large group of people.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't intend to take the lead in everything on her own, so she only confirmed that some friends had expressed interest, but none had actually reached the audition stage: “Jiang Dang is quite eager to collaborate with me again, and I’m also looking forward to it. I hope there will be another chance next time.” She mentioned a real name to add some intrigue and prevent the conversation from becoming too generic.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao had asked Jiang Dang for his opinion beforehand.
 

 
He said it didn’t matter.
 

 
After a while, he even texted her: "Do you want me to get my Weibo password back, post a few emotional posts to increase credibility? Would that give you more face?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "There’s no need."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I saw your manager bought a bunch of quick-acting heart-saving pills for Double 12, that’s probably your doing."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I'll take better care of him."
 

 
Later, as Tong Zhao was scrolling through her WeChat Moments, she saw a post from Jiang Dang’s manager, clearly upset, with a screenshot of a conversation. Jiang Dang had sent him a message saying, “[Drink more hot water].”
 

 
Drinking more hot water was one thing, but adding candles? The title of "Most Annoying Singer of the Year" was truly deserved.
 

 
When Xue Yutang mentioned one of Tong Zhao's rumored romantic interests, he immediately became energized. However, she didn’t let him drag the topic too deep. They subtly shifted the conversation back to the film, as the most discussed topic of ‘Heartless Tribulation' recently—apart from Tong Zhao—was its art direction.
 

 
People might start to feel resentful toward the film if they overhype her association with it.
 

 
Is it true that without Tong Zhao, the movie would be worthless?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t want others to evaluate her films that way.
 

 
The movie was the result of the hard work of many behind-the-scenes staff, and the audience had noticed that. All she needed to do was cooperate with the promotion and play the supporting role while others took the spotlight—though Shi Qianqiu didn’t care at all. He found it quite amusing and simply decided to credit her for his work as well. He wanted to witness the birth of the Thanos of the current film industry.
 

 
The art director, Qian Rui, hurried to clarify that he had only played a supportive role in adjusting things.
 

 
The aesthetic direction of the entire film was steered by Director Shi.
 

 
Xue Yutang sighed, “Your entire crew has such a childlike spirit.”
 

 
Qian Rui agreed, “Yes, Director Shi has so many cute ideas.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was clearly uncomfortable with that description and showed an expression of silent discontent.
 

 
Later, when the show aired, many viewers became interested in the handsome men and women and the visual spectacle shown in the trailers and movie clips. As more people watched ‘Neverland Girl’, the one-sided praise for Tong Zhao started to decrease. Not that no one was still praising her, but now people were talking more about the film's other merits.
 

 
However, no matter how much praise was heaped on others, it all inevitably circled back to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was impressive, and Tong Zhao, the one who invited him to be the director, was certainly no ordinary person. No one credited Xu Yiming for this achievement. The only thing Xu Yiming did well was handing the script to Tong Zhao.
 

 
She really is everywhere!

This particular episode of ‘Let's Start Filming’ had a particularly thick barrage of comments.
 

 
Just the segment where Tong Zhao, as the male lead of her new film, flirted with Shi Qianqiu resulted in countless memes flying across the screen.
 

 
[Life is hopeless.JPG], [I'm dirty.JPG], [Shi Qianqiu, full of charm.JPG]... It was hard to even find the complete set of memes, there were just too many. Netizens looked at this and thought, didn’t they say the two were rumored to be in a hot, romantic relationship? Why does it look like they can’t stand each other?
 

 
Then came the hilarious stories from the set.
 

 
[Shi the old thief, never acting human, scared my Zhao Bao to hiccup! Come out and take the beating!]
 

 
[Just send a knife in the mail and be done with it.]
 

 
[Oh my god, I can’t believe that such beautiful scenes from ‘Neverland Girl’ came from Shi the old thief. My mindset just shattered, I can’t accept that he has a beautiful soul!]
 

 
[No, his heart is still dark, he just has eyes that are good at spotting beauty…]
 

 
Tong Zhao herself thought her relationship with Shi Qianqiu was more like that of good buddies.
 

 
Even when they were on the show, the smell of romance and cheesy drama just didn’t exist.
 

 
But it was hard to fight against netizens who looked at her through a thick pink filter. They clipped the part where she flirted with Shi Qianqiu and added the recent popular TikTok song, “Did I just realize, you are my antidote––”
 

 
It was impressive.
 

 
They turned Shi Qianqiu’s incredulous expression into an atmosphere of bashfulness.
 

 
It wasn’t exactly making something out of nothing.
 

 
It was more like a maliciously fabricated, shipping-level kind of slander.
 

 
The short video was edited very well.
 

 
The video creator, clearly desperate for attention, thought to themselves, "The brave survive and the timid starve," and tagged Shi Qianqiu on Weibo, asking him how he felt about the level of editing.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied:
 

 
[If it gets over 500 shares, you’ll be going to jail.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu wasn’t actually angry, and the video creator knew how to play it cool. They pretended to back off and personally funded a promotion, offering 20 holographic ‘Neverland Girl' movie tickets in a lottery to fans, as a way of giving back. Shi Qianqiu then liked the post, essentially giving his silent approval.
 

 
Fans who followed the couple from the beginning and watched until the end pieced together the storyline, and the onlookers couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
 

 
The movie's box office performed well, but Director Shi didn’t take any royalties—nothing to do with him.
 

 
So why was he so invested in promoting it?
 

 
It seemed like he had his own motives, maybe a deep connection with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some said that even if he wasn’t taking a share of the profits, the director would still want his hard work to pay off.
 

 
But Shi Qianqiu had worked on many successful films with high box office earnings before, yet we had never seen him promote so enthusiastically. What was going on? Opinions were divided. The couple’s ship was sailing strong, and there were theories behind it. Whether it was Shi or Zhao, both were seen as successful people in the public’s eyes, and successful people surely did things with careful planning—every move had ten steps already figured out.
 

 
However, the truth was simple:
 

 
"Bro, what have you been up to lately? You never come home for dinner."
 

 
At the Shi household.
 

 
A young, handsome man with a receding hairline, his voice tinged with a hint of complaint, asked.
 

 
Shi Wan Dong had always been his older brother’s shadow when they were kids, and even now, though his admiration had changed, he still looked up to him. But now, his life had other priorities—managing the family business, and his deep relationship with his fiancée.
 

 
"Not much."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu naturally picked up a piece of green pepper—his least favorite—and put it into his brother's bowl: "Every time a new movie of mine is released, I have to do publicity. It'll settle down after a while. And what about you? Never bring your girlfriend over for dinner?"
 

 
"Don’t talk about Xuanxuan."
 

 
Even though he admired his older brother, Shi Wandong decided that before marriage, he would definitely keep his girlfriend out of sight—especially from his brother. He had noticed that his previous girlfriends, after meeting his older brother, mysteriously ended up liking him instead. Shi Qianqiu had never done anything to encourage it; the brothers just had different tastes in women, and perhaps it was simply destiny that his brother’s charm always overshadowed his own.
 

 
Shi Wandong changed the subject: "The movie is making money, but it won’t end up in your pocket."
 

 
That was true; the earnings didn’t go to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
"This is the first time I’ve worked on a movie with such a tight budget. Your brother is experiencing life firsthand, and it’s actually pretty interesting."
 

 
Shi Wandong understood.
 

 
"As long as you’re happy, big bro."
 

 
"Then what about Tong Zhao? Will I ever have a proper sister-in-law?"
 

 
"Don’t mention her. Her acting is actually quite good. The other day, she was pretending to be a man on the show. But when we were doing publicity, I kept thinking she should have gone into the men's restroom with me."
 

 
As Shi Qianqiu spoke, he absentmindedly rubbed his ear.
 

 
It was the same spot that Han Zhi had “harassed” him that day.
 

 
Shi Wandong looked at his older brother for a while and suddenly said, "Bro, I’m actually knowledgeable about the transgender community. I wouldn’t mind having a ‘spiritual’ male sister-in-law."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s response was to fill his brother’s bowl with a heap of green peppers.
 

 
*
 

 
A week after the movie’s release, the neighboring critics were lying down, ready to be ridiculed.
 

 
There was no ridicule, though.
 

 
Because no one was discussing it—everyone was talking about ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
Some people were saying that the female protagonist’s villa, designed by the famous director Shi, looked so magnificent and dreamy, almost like a castle. If only there were theme parks like Universal Studios in China, they would love to visit it in person.
 

 
Others said that Han Zhi’s portrayal of Nie Su was so captivating that it was a love-at-first-sight kind of performance.
 

 
"Stop pretending to be a liar, come be an old Baby’s little wolfdog. I’d be happy to take care of him."
 

 
Then there were those who were charmed by Tong Zhao, saying they never expected she had such a cute side to her.
 

 
A new group began to rise:
 

 
[Gathering of Tong Zhao's dad fans here!]
 

 
[Since Han Zhi modeled for the character, how about creating a long-term model for young Tong Zhao as well? I want to see more of her!]
 

 
Male fans calling for the “father’s approval” were immediately reprimanded by female fans defending Tong Zhao, telling them not to speak like that as it would bring bad influences to their beloved. The male fans thought about it and quickly changed their wording: [Tong Zhao’s mama loves you!]
 

 
Not long after, they were pointed out again: [Always talking about mama, mama, mama?]
 

 
Fine, let them call her “mama”!
 

 
Tong Zhao showed this to Zhao Zai, and everyone loved her.
 

 
Zhao Zai was initially very pleased, her face flushed, but soon she saw the “mama fans” commenting:
 

 
"Protect the world's cutest Zhao Zai!"
 

 
...
 

 
Zhao Zai pouted and quickly dashed back to her room to sulk.
 

 
[Congratulations, host! You’ve activated Zhao Zai’s passive skill: "The Group's Favorite Aura." From the elderly to children, there is no one who doesn’t like this little one! If the person holds no ill will towards the host, they’ll automatically have 40% favorability.]
 

 
40% favorability...
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s experience with quick transmigration, this meant that the person would unconsciously find her likable, wanting to care for her, but it wouldn’t be to the point of being madly infatuated.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought this might be useful for business and TV appearances, but she didn’t want to keep it active all the time. Still, she was a bit puzzled: [Didn’t Brother Zhi and Shuyi activate skills for me before?] She actually also wanted to say, “I didn’t know the system was still active.”
 

 
System: [Not activated.]
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed that perhaps there were some conditions she wasn’t aware of.
 

 
Now that life was going smoothly, she didn’t feel the need to turn herself into a jack-of-all-trades, an all-powerful “Thanos,” so she didn’t pursue any other skills.
 

 
For now, she was already quite capable.
 

 
After ‘Neverland Girl' had been out for about a month, the box office was raking in money at a crazy rate, eventually reaching a number that even a romance movie would never dare to dream of.
 

 
Two billion!
 

 
Next door, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ only earned a quarter of that, and it was still considered to have broken even—it's not considered a failure, after all. In the entire film industry, most movies end up losing money. It's often like the pharmaceutical industry developing new drugs; investors rely on the profitable projects to cover the losses, and if they make a profit by the end of the year, it's considered a success.
 

 
Films in the industry can lose money severely, but when they earn, they earn big.
 

 
This number is terrifying.
 

 
The industry was shocked. Could a romance movie really make that much money? After some post-analysis of the data, it turns out that there hadn’t been any high-quality romance films in the last six months. The industry turned to big-budget special effects films because they were considered more profitable. Shi Qianqiu came up with a perfect idea that combined both elements, filling the gap in the market.
 

 
Fans started doing the math, and after subtracting the costs and various other expenses, Tong Zhao had made quite a fortune from this. At the very least, the recent drama with her mortgage loan, once she gets this money, she could outright purchase a new house.
 

 
Other stars’ fans were a bit jealous, saying that the money was just too easy to make.
 

 
Entertainment forums often had industry professionals commenting, as the entire industry relied heavily on behind-the-scenes staff. They came out to break things down for the netizens:
 

 
The entire film industry’s earnings are like an upside-down pyramid: the hits make most of the box office revenue, while the flops sit at the bottom with no return.
 

 
If your idol wants to earn so much, they either need to use their own savings to invest in movies or be famous enough to directly negotiate a deal with the producers for a cut of the profits. Otherwise, forget about it.
 

 
At this point, a netizen commented in the thread:
 

 
[Stop, the tears can't be held back anymore. Let's not discuss her, TZ is truly one of a kind.]
 

 
[No, I love hearing this, don’t mind the delicate feelings, keep talking about the profit sharing.]
 

 
Soon after, other gossip-loving netizens moved on to different threads. Another hot topic was Tong Zhao’s father—
 

 
Every time she made money, there was always someone bringing up her scoundrel father.
 

 
What was he doing, anyway? Just bury him already.
 

 
Even if he’s buried, they’ll dig him up and whip his corpse.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was a well-known figure, and his recent situation was easy to find out—he had just sent his youngest daughter off to marry. He worked himself to the bone, scraping by to manage the company, and the net profit of the company might take ten years to equal what his eldest daughter earned from one movie.
 

 
No one knew what his feelings would be upon seeing the overwhelming praise for Tong Zhao all over the news and online.
 

 
The netizens guessed correctly—it probably felt worse than having his ancestor’s grave dug up.
 

 
The gossiping netizens were having a blast, continuously digging up and whipping his reputation, like a cruel revival of buried suffering. Meanwhile, Tong Zhao had completely forgotten to flaunt her success to him—it just wasn’t on her mind; she was too busy. With the film promotion winding down, she was now focused on handling a large sum of money that had come her way, looking for ways to make it grow.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s investment success had finally won over the film industry.
 

 
To put it this way, in the past, when Hong Kong films shot police and gangster movies, they’d pay respects to Guan Gong.
 

 
Now, when filmmakers in China make instinctive films, there are plenty who secretly offer a prayer to a photo of Tong Zhao, almost as if they wanted to present her with some gold ingots and candles, hoping to share in her good fortune.
 

 
Sister Chu brought over a pile of projects, hoping to let Tong Zhao choose.
 

 
Outsiders believed that someone as big as Tong Zhao should be living a life full of glamorous parties.
 

 
But not Tong Zhao. She stayed in her spacious flat, played by herself when she was tired, and when she wasn’t, she watched the stock market.
 

 
Recently, she had a feeling that another door in her mental palace was about to open.
 

 
As she was pondering this, her agent, Sister Chu, told her:
 

 
"Many variety shows want to invite you to make an appearance. Would you like to pick one to try out?”
# Chapter116
Tong Zhao was overwhelmed by the options.
 

 
The projects presented to her included not only invitations to appear as a short-term guest on popular existing variety shows but also concepts that hadn't yet begun production and were still in the idea phase. Sister Chu explained, "If you express even a slight interest, funding and production teams will immediately get to work. Just pick whatever you like."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Sister Chu added, "You can narrow it down to a few you’re interested in. If you’re unsure, I can take them back and discuss with the team to select the one that suits you best from all angles."
 

 
After all, handling these decisions was the job of her manager and team—to let the artist fully focus on their creative work.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and began sifting through the variety show proposals.
 

 
There were so many that it was dizzying.
 

 
She first eliminated the survival-themed shows. After the wildly successful ‘One Life Survivor’ aired and revealed its rating data—a sharp V-shaped curve with a significant disparity between the episodes featuring Tong Zhao and those without her—similar survival programs began flooding her with invitations.
 

 
Since Duan Ge's grievances had been adequately vented during that program, leaving him calm for now, Tong Zhao had no plans to revisit that genre anytime soon.
 

 
As a result, she set aside a pile of invitations that guaranteed her center stage and heavily marketed the programs around her, not even bothering to glance at them.
 

 
There was ‘Quirky Stand-Up’, a comedy-based talk show.
 
‘New Era Talent Group’, a talent competition show, invited her as a special guest mentor and mystery star. Tong Zhao was somewhat interested in this one—since it was just a one-time appearance, she marked it with a star.
 
‘Cohabitation Era’, a program about celebrities experiencing rental life.
 

 
...
 

 
After excluding the food, travel, and entertainment-focused variety shows, Tong Zhao found herself with few programs that truly piqued her interest. Ultimately, she singled out a seven-day immersive reality show, ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
The highlight of the show was watching celebrities take care of children. The most entertaining aspect was the interaction between the stars and the adorable yet mischievous kids. The production team somehow managed to invite children with extraordinary backgrounds—half of them were second-generation kids of big-name stars, renowned singers, famous directors, and other influential figures.
 

 
The remaining kids, though not from celebrity families, often had unique characteristics due to their upbringing.
 

 
Rambunctious kids are already a handful, but these were not only someone else's children but also kids with powerful backgrounds. Even on an immersive reality show, no one dared truly scold them. One by one, young male idols and female stars were driven to the edge, turning chaos into high ratings for the show.
 

 
These second-generation toddlers were notoriously difficult to handle.
 

 
In real life, they might suppress their personalities, acting indifferent toward what they deemed “stupid adults.” But on this show, they were brimming with opinions, leaving their celebrity "siblings" speechless and helpless.
 

 
Obedience? Not a chance.
 

 
"Foolish adults!"
 

 
One of the audience's favorite segments involved the program inviting the children's real parents to watch a live broadcast of the antics. The show would then film their reactions and interview them about their thoughts.
 

 
Netizens dubbed this segment ‘The Public Trial Hour.’
 

 
As Tong Zhao read through the project details, the personalities in her mental palace had mixed opinions:
 

 
Consort Chen: "Pass. Seeing children irritates me."
 

 
Back in her ancient world, Consort Chen's focus was entirely on winning favor. Pregnancy meant ten months of being unable to seek favor and the inevitable ruin of one's figure, so she had taken every measure to avoid it. Early on, many concubines with children had flaunted their kids to provoke her, causing endless annoyance.
 

 
The mothers would make snide remarks while their children delivered unfiltered jabs with their innocent words.
 

 
Both the mother and child assumed Consort Chen wouldn’t stoop to picking a fight with a child.
 

 
However, Consort Chen had her maid slap the concubine across the face before pinching the little prince's chubby cheeks and lifting his face until he could no longer shout insults like "vile fox spirit." She asked coldly, “Does His Highness think I don’t discipline children?”
 

 
Indeed, Consort Chen didn’t physically punish children. Instead, she had the little prince’s cheeks turn red from the pinch, then ensured the Emperor removed his name from the list of outings like hunts and excursions. As a final touch, she doubled the boy’s homework assignments.

Duan Ge: "I don’t have much experience dealing with kids either."
 

 
Shuyi: "I’m not interested, but if Tong Zhao needs me, I can endure it."
 

 
Both Shuyi and Han Zhi agreed on this, while Lu Xianzhang decided to retreat into seclusion.
 

 
If Tong Zhao was to appear on a variety show, she pragmatically wanted to choose one with the highest viewership.
 

 
Though she had become a legendary box office hitmaker, Tong Zhao acknowledged that luck played a part. There was no need to always gamble on niche or unpopular projects that others avoided.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll go alone for this one."
 

 
In her recovered memories, Tong Zhao couldn’t recall being particularly skilled at taking care of kids.
 

 
While she was absorbed in studying one of the proposals, Sister Chu peeked over her shoulder. “There’s a second page at the back. Aren’t you going to check it?”
 

 
“Oh, I forgot.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped to the second page.
 

 
Typically, the second page outlined the benefits and arrangements for the invited celebrity. For instance, the survival shows Tong Zhao had previously rejected detailed her role as either a dominant antagonist or a team leader. They even outlined specific scenarios designed to showcase her appeal and gain fans, with clear sincerity.
 

 
But when they reached the second page this time, both of them were stunned.

[Special Guest Role on ‘Baby Chaos’]
 

 
[The production team is impressed by Ms. Tong’s child model performance in ‘Neverland Girl’. They’d like to invite her to participate as a unique guest—disguised as a toddler named "Xiao Zhao" to join the group of children. Once in the immersive setting, all other participants’ memories of your real identity will be suppressed.]
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Is this even allowed?”
 

 
Sister Chu, recovering from her initial shock, laughed and said, “For others, no. But for you, absolutely. I remember now—they made a special childhood model for you in the movie, didn’t they? That adorable design won over a huge following. Tons of fans started calling you ‘Baby Zhao’ and wishing they could adopt you. They begged for you to perform a ‘return to childhood’ transformation.”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao mused silently—she wasn’t even old.
 

 
Hearing herself praised, the child version of Zhao, nicknamed “Baby Zhao,” peeked curiously from her mental palace. However, Consort Chen mercilessly pushed her back inside.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao could respond, Sister Chu stared at her head in amazement. “I don’t know how your brain works, Xiao Zhao. For most people, there’s always a slight disconnect between their holographic model and their real self—it feels awkward. But you? You can turn into a man or a child without the slightest sense of dissonance.”
 

 
“Is it really that awkward for others?”
 

 
“Of course.” Sister Chu shared an industry joke to explain.
 

 
Once, a male actor had a sudden whim and paid extra to a modeler, asking to add 5 cm to his holographic model.
 

 
The modeler asked, “Which part of you are we adding 5 cm to?”
 

 
The actor replied, “Can it be ‘everywhere’?”
 

 
The modeler said, “That’ll cost extra.”
 

 
In the end, the actor only increased his height by 5 cm.
 

 
But when filming began, he couldn’t handle it. His subconscious felt something was off everywhere, to the point where he started questioning the meaning of his existence. Ultimately, he had to pull his consciousness out and reshoot from scratch.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s eyes glimmered slightly as she listened to Sister Chu continue, “But don’t worry. There have been others with adaptability as strong as yours. Experts call this… something like ‘exceptionally wide brain capacity.’”
 

 
Wide brain capacity refers to individuals with extraordinarily high mental strength, according to the system’s perspective.
 

 
If the brain is seen as a bag, these people have massive bags capable of holding far more. However, to display the kind of dazzling and versatile abilities Tong Zhao has in immersive films, that bag must be filled with all kinds of rich life experiences. This isn’t something ordinary people can cultivate, and there’s no training school for it either.
 

 
Sister Chu explained all this to dispel any doubts Tong Zhao might have from hearing critics call her a “freak.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, unfazed, smirked faintly. “I’ll think it over and give my answer in three days.”
 

 
Sister Chu, ever confident in her decisions, simply told her to consider what type of film she’d want to do next.
 

 
Not much guidance there.
 

 
Tong Zhao noted the look of complete trust in Sister Chu’s eyes and thought, ‘At this rate, if I said I wanted to do a ridiculously melodramatic film about teenage heartbreak, with abortions and suicides, Sister Chu wouldn’t stop me either.’

In the mental palace:
 

 
Hearing Xiao Zhao being bullied by the Noble Consort, little Zhao puffed out her cheeks in frustration like a steamed bun. Meanwhile, the reclusive Lu Xianzhang, who had been pretending to meditate, emerged from his room and heroically sacrificed himself to distract the Noble Consort and draw her ire.
 

 
Xiao Zhao scurried behind Tong Zhao, her tiny legs moving quickly as she clung to her back, asking in a babyish voice, “Do lots of people really like me?”
 

 
“Yes, a lot of people say you’re adorable.”
 

 
And silly.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought privately.
 

 
“I heard that!” Xiao Zhao huffed.
 

 
“I’m sorry,” Tong Zhao replied. “I just didn’t expect I was like this as a child.”
 

 
Most people misunderstand what they were like as children. When their parents or elders reminisce about those days, they often look incredulous. Those with better family conditions might even have childhood videos, revealing moments they don’t remember at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so used to her calm, mature adult self that she’d assumed she’d always been that way.
 

 
Until she saw Xiao Zhao.
 

 
A walking, talking version of her younger self.
 

 
Xiao Zhao puffed up her cheeks indignantly. “I’m very calm and mature!”
 

 
“Mmhmm, sure,” Tong Zhao replied, patting her head. Her hair was soft and fine, like kitten fur. Little Zhao habitually nuzzled her hand, like a trusting little kitten-piglet. “So, do you want to go on the variety show as a little kid?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao nodded enthusiastically, as if her head were a bobblehead doll.
 

 
Afterward, she shyly twisted her fingers together and murmured, “I kind of want to play with the other kids...”
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly understood.
 

 
Every time a person grows, they say goodbye to their former self.
 

 
After being deceived and devastated by that scumbag of a man, she had killed off the naïve girl who once gave everything without reservation.
 

 
In adulthood, Tong Zhao excelled in every world she entered. Every persona she activated thrived in its own way, so much so that others rarely noticed any differences. But Xiao Zhao was unique—she represented the self that hadn’t yet had the chance to grow up. Her opportunities to come out and play were few and far between.
 

 
Realizing this, Tong Zhao’s heart softened completely. She felt like an indulgent adult who had traveled back in time and was now spoiling her childhood self senseless.
 

 
“Alright, we’ll let a whole group of kids play with Xiao Zhao.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao beamed with joy and planted a happy kiss on her cheek.
 

 
From somewhere nearby, the Noble Consort spoke wistfully, “I want a group of handsome men to play with me too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended not to hear, tidied up, and climbed into bed to sleep.
 

 
---
 

 
The director of ‘Baby Chaos’ was overjoyed to learn Tong Zhao had agreed to appear as a guest. After some discussion, they decided to keep her role as a “special kid participant” a secret to maximize the surprise effect when the episode aired. They only announced that Tong Zhao would be joining the show.
 

 
The program already had high viewership, but the announcement caused an uproar online.
 

 
[Tong Zhao is practically a baby herself. How can she take care of other babies? I’m worried, QAQ.]
 

 
The wave of “mom fans” hadn’t even subsided when another post gained traction:
 

 
[What do you mean, ‘baby’? Keep in mind that Sister Zhao has a martial arts background. I’m looking forward to her tearing into some bratty kids on the show!]
 

 
As discussions heated up, the official ‘Baby Chaos’ account dropped a bombshell:
 

 
> @BabyChaos: Announcing another guest, @Jiang Dang.
 

 
No one expected this—what a dream team!
 

 
Netizens were stunned.
 

 
Although ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ had wrapped up its theatrical run some time ago, people's perception of time regarding major internet events tends to be blurry. Besides, Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were essentially the same person, and Shi Qianqiu was the director—so in the eyes of fans, Tong Zhao’s most “official” on-screen couple was Jiang Dang.
 

 
This held true despite the fact that Tong Zhao’s boyfriend in the film was played by another actor.
 

 
However, it was Jiang Dang who reaped the CP (couple pairing) popularity benefits alongside Tong Zhao. It just goes to show how unpredictable things can be—artists who know how to stir the pot always end up benefiting.
 

 
[OMG, OMG! Can you imagine the two of them raising a kid together? A preview of their future family of three!]
 

 
[Are you sure the producers trust Jiang Dang with a kid? Let’s be real, if he doesn’t lose himself, it’ll already be a miracle.]
 

 
[Can Jiang Dang even survive without his assistant and manager? /doge emoji]
 

 
This wasn’t just blind trolling—he had a track record.
 

 
During a promotional event, Jiang Dang was allowed to take a short break. He decided to wander around nearby, only for his phone to get stolen. As he wandered aimlessly, he ended up getting lost. Eventually, he had to ask a passerby for help, and when they recognized him, a crowd quickly formed, three layers deep, all recording him on their phones and demanding a live rendition of one of his viral earworm songs.
 

 
Instead, all they captured was his pitiful, downcast expression as he stood there helpless.
 

 
A 6-foot-tall, handsome man, reduced to looking like a lost kindergarten boy. Netizens found it hysterical.
 

 
But just two weeks later, he released a new pop song about feeling like an outsider searching for his identity. The music video featured his brooding, indifferent aesthetic, which swept across the internet, erasing the “silly rich boy” image completely. The plan had worked flawlessly!
 

 
CP fans were ecstatic, seeing it as the ultimate fanservice.
 

 
Historically, ‘Baby Chaos’ had segments involving interactions between “parent” pairs. If the episode’s lineup of child guests wasn’t extensive, it wasn’t unusual for two celebrities to share the responsibility of caring for one child.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t the only ones causing a stir. Other netizens, just looking for drama, egged the show on:
 

 
[Pair up Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao to take care of a kid—that would be EPIC! Producers, don’t miss this chance!]
 

 
Meanwhile, both individual fanbases retreated to their own corners, firmly refusing to support any forced pairing.
 

 
The already popular show reached new heights of anticipation. The producers, delighted by the soaring buzz and skyrocketing search data, were over the moon.
 

 
When Tong Zhao heard the news, she was a little surprised, wondering if Jiang Dang had agreed to the show because of her.
 

 
The Noble Consort asked how she felt about it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, responded, “Don’t you already know exactly how I feel? I’m just surprised, that’s all.”
 

 
To be honest, she didn’t feel much of anything.
 

 
She neither disliked the idea of being linked with him nor felt flattered by it.
 

 
The former was because she had also used him once, leveraging his name as a shield when selecting the male lead for a film. The latter was because Jiang Dang was an enigmatic character. While he had made his feelings for her quite clear, he hadn’t lingered around or followed up, keeping a certain mystique.
 

 
Perhaps an artist’s version of “liking someone” is just this unpredictable.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t dwell on it.
 

 
What she didn’t expect was that less than an hour after the announcement was made on the official account, Jiang Dang sent her a message asking if they could grab a meal together.
 

 
A meal?
 

 
His message was a voice note. That distinctive, deep voice of his carried the invitation, making her ears tingle as if kissed by the wind. His tone was perfectly normal—neither overly formal nor casual—just a simple, straightforward question.
 

 
Blame it on his incredible voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt it was her own overthinking and responded with a voice message:
 

 
“Before or after filming? What are we eating? Ugh, ever since becoming a celebrity, even grabbing a meal with friends has become a challenge. But if we’re really doing this, we should pick a place with good privacy…”
 

 
The Noble Consort chimed in: “A handsome guy invites you to dinner, and you’re worried about what to eat and when to eat? You’re something else.”
 

 
Zhao Zai (Xiao Zai) peeked in curiously: “Then what should I be concerned about?”
 

 
The Noble Consort replied smugly: “You should check if it coincides with your cycle—”
 

 
“Hey! Why are you shoving me?”
 

 
To stop the Noble Consort from corrupting the child with inappropriate comments, the Immortal Master pulled her into his room.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t oblivious; she’d considered plenty.
 

 
A man and a woman dining alone—if it wasn’t for work, it definitely meant something.
 

 
Maybe it was her upbringing, but Tong Zhao was rather indifferent when it came to relationships.
 

 
During her time as the Noble Consort, she’d been at her peak in terms of liking men.
 

 
Now that she was back to being herself, surrounded by beautiful men and women alike, she found herself feeling indifferent toward anyone.
 

 
Recently, Jiang Dang hadn’t contacted her much. When he did, it was always proper and work-related. Tong Zhao suspected he might not mean anything by it.
 

 
But before she could overthink, Jiang Dang’s reply came almost immediately after her message was sent—three voice notes in quick succession:
 

 
“Anything is fine. I can work around your schedule.”
 

 
“Let’s eat whatever you feel like eating.”
 

 
“Friends grabbing a meal?”
 

 
The last one ended with a fleeting, low chuckle.
 

 
It sounded like he didn’t just want to be friends.
# Chapter117
Unconsciously, Tong Zhao raised her hand to scratch her ear.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was perfectly normal—he wasn’t being overly flirty or calling her pet names. Yet that low, unhurried rhythm in his voice seemed to brush against her eardrums, leaving them tingling. This man didn’t need any extraordinary talent to be a singer. His natural musical gift was just icing on the cake. Even if he sat there with a guitar and hummed some out-of-tune melody, it would still be a soul-stirring serenade.
 

 
She was momentarily dazed when her phone suddenly rang.
 

 
The caller ID read: Jiang Dang.
 

 
Consort Chen: "I like him—if you like him too, you should go for it."
 

 
Shuyi chuckled: "You're just still bitter that Little Kai didn’t understand the situation last time and ended up helping his rival."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Tch."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Placing my bets now!"
 

 
Her inner consciousness had turned into a stock market of speculation.
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored them, steadied herself, and picked up the call. She greeted him with a simple "Hello." He got straight to the point.
 

 
"Sending messages back and forth might miss your reaction." His sentences were short and clipped, likely a habit from his singing career. Even in conversation, there was a rhythm, with light and heavy tones alternating naturally. "I wanted to call and talk to you," he added with a laugh, "because I couldn’t wait to hear your voice—it’s so pleasant."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled slightly. "How could I dare think my voice sounds good in front of you?"
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, "I thought about calling you on video, but that might not be appropriate."
 

 
Fair enough—it would have been a bit abrupt.
 

 
Tong Zhao found herself surprised at how socially adept he was.
 

 
Jiang Dang continued, "After this meal, we’ll count as friends. Next time, I’ll call you on video."
 

 
...
 

 
Well, now—was this a gradual progression tactic?
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing but wasn’t particularly averse to the idea of a video call. After all, he was a very attractive man, and she wasn’t the type to clam up in front of a camera.
 

 
"Sure, why not?"
 

 
She opened her calendar and shared six days she had available, leaving the choice up to him. When it came to deciding what to eat, she couldn’t make up her mind. Jiang Dang suggested coming over to her place and cooking for her.
 

 
"Do you cook?" she asked, genuinely surprised. Would he blow up her kitchen?
 

 
Jiang Dang reassured her, "I do. When I lack inspiration, I cook or do housework. Baking helps me calm my mind."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She was genuinely curious about what Jiang Dang could whip up in the kitchen. Judging by his current approach—actively pursuing her and showing sincerity—the goodwill he’d built up over time was enough for her to give him a chance to show off his skills. As for whether it was safe for the two of them to be alone, she figured if it came down to a fight, he’d be the one worrying about personal safety, not her.
 

 
They set the dinner date for three days before the filming of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
In the meantime, Tong Zhao, enjoying her vacation, leisurely played games at home.
 

 
For her fans, who had been eagerly waiting, she decided to open a livestream.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao had been too busy with work to play games with Wei Zekai. But now, when she logged in, she saw a string of new skin gift packs and a barrage full of lemon emojis. Some fans were envious of the gifts she had received, while others were jealous of Wei Zekai having the special "Zhao Zhao’s Friend" badge. They also wanted to send skins to Tong Zhao.
 

 
"Not for free, I have to carry him to rank up," Tong Zhao said with a smile as she and Wei Zekai played five rounds together, and as expected, they won all of them.
 

 
Afterward, some fans intentionally queued up against her. Some helped by giving her resources, while others maliciously stole her minions for experience. Tong Zhao was unfazed, playing calmly as always. However, Wei Zekai talked a lot in the voice chat.
 

 
"Let's end the stream here," Tong Zhao glanced at the bottom right corner of her screen. "I have a dinner appointment with a friend."
 

 
The barrage immediately flooded with questions asking who the friend was, male or female.
 

 
Some viewers joked that Wei Zekai was in danger.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was also watching Tong Zhao’s stream, noticed the comment and, looking puzzled, asked, "Why am I in danger?"
 

 
[Do you know who she’s having dinner with?]
 

 
"I don't know! What does it matter who she's having dinner with?" Wei Zekai replied, genuinely confused.
 

 
He and Tong Zhao had a very close relationship, but he didn’t think she needed to report to him about having dinner with someone else!
 

 
[Oh wow, didn’t expect Wei Zekai to have a mature side.]
 

 
[What do you know, this is the calmness of the main wife!]
 

 
It was indeed very calm.
 

 
Then, an SVIP user sent a barrage of colorful comments:
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu]
 

 
……
 

 
"Tong Zhao, you’re having dinner with Shi Qianqiu???"
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned. "Huh?"
 

 
The barrage exploded in laughter.
 

 
This reminded viewers of a story:
 

 
Why would an old farmer, who is willing to donate one hundred acres of land and one million to the country, refuse to donate a cow? Because he actually has a cow.
 

 
Why is Wei Zekai so mature and generous?
 

 
Because he hasn't faced reality.
 

 
[He’s panicking, he’s panicking, he’s panicking!]
 

 
"What does this have to do with Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao, still puzzled, turned off the livestream.
 

 
When the livestream blacked out and everything went silent, the audience in the barrage got anxious and began calling for her not to end it, wanting to hear more. However, it was no use. Some viewers checked both of their game IDs, only to find that they were offline. Left halfway through the gossip, the audience resorted to chatting in the barrage, speculating that Wei Zekai seemed to have strong opinions about Director Shi Qianqiu and didn’t seem to like him.
 

 
[Isn't it normal to dislike the old thief Shi?]
 

 
[Yeah, didn’t you all see the interview for the movie premiere? Shi Qianqiu’s ending for Nie Su was so real, it felt like a social revenge story. I wish the authors I follow weren’t so heartless like him. I don’t want to see harsh reality; I just want to eat small sweet buns qwq]
 

 
[Honestly, I want to see a drama unfold.]
 

 
Some viewers even went to Weibo to ask Shi Qianqiu directly.
 

 
Some asked if it was true that he was having dinner with Tong Zhao, while others speculated that Wei Zekai might be jealous and wondered how he would respond.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu actually replied.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v: [The movie ‘Neverland Girl’ has finished screening.]
 

 
What does that mean?
 

 
They didn’t even ask about the movie. Was he replying to the wrong comment?
 

 
After reflecting, the viewers figured it out. Turns out, the previous rumors about him and Tong Zhao were just promotional stunts for the movie. Now that the movie was done, there was no need to make money off tickets, and the plastic CP had expired, no need to mention it anymore.
 

 
[Wow, what a realistic man.]
 

 
[Turns out, I’ve been supporting the wrong person.]
 

 
The viewers felt that Shi Qianqiu was cold and indifferent, while he probably just found all the drama amusing.
 

 
It was the middle of winter in China, and he’d taken a long vacation, heading to the southern hemisphere for a trip.
 

 
＊
 

 
After filming the music video in the snow, Jiang Dang worked non-stop for 36 hours. He didn’t sleep well on the plane either, and when he got off the flight, he felt dazed. Normally a bit slow, with a hat and mask on, only his deep, penetrating eyes were visible. His new assistant thought he was in a bad mood, so during the drive to his destination, the assistant didn’t speak to him and didn’t dare to play any music.
 

 
So sleepy...
 

 
It was about time for him to feel tired.
 

 
The director had made him retake so many shots to match the mood of the song. With his head leaning against the window, his cold eyes looked as if he were plotting something bad, but in reality, he was about to doze off.
 

 
“If you're tired, Brother Dong, you can take a nap. I drive very steadily,” the assistant kindly suggested.
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head. “I’m too awake to sleep.”
 

 
The assistant, seeing his heavy eyelids in the rearview mirror, felt like he was redefining what "awake" meant.
 

 
Thinking about finally seeing Tong Zhao soon, Jiang Dang immediately felt awake again.
 

 
He propped his eyelids up and, to stay alert, lightly hummed a song.
 

 
After a while, the assistant, a little embarrassed, interrupted him. “Brother, your singing is so good and so moving, but if you keep singing, I’m going to get sleepy too.”
 

 
The driver definitely couldn’t fall asleep.
 

 
Jiang Dang was always easygoing, and immediately switched to a new song, softly and mournfully improvising a rearranged version of ‘I Come From the Grassland’. The new assistant almost had a mental breakdown listening to it.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Do you think it sounds good?"
 

 
Assistant: "Yeah... it sounds good..."
 

 
"How specifically does it sound good?"
 

 
"It’s very... grassland-y, bro."
 

 
Basically, it’s very grassy.
 

 
Jiang Dang laughed, singing all the way to the ‘Yu Long Xuan’ (a place). He switched to a song from ‘Initial D’ halfway through—’Drift’—and got the assistant so hyped up that the car sped up significantly. Only when they reached Yu Long Xuan and saw the security guard who was nearly two meters tall did the assistant finally calm down.
 

 
After dropping the assistant off, Jiang Dang entered the elevator that went directly to his unit and entered the code.
 

 
The elevator was very quiet, except for his heartbeat, which felt loud.
 

 
Thump, thump, thump, thump...
 

 
He raised a hand to his chest, trying to get it to beat in rhythm.
 

 
But the heartbeat didn’t follow his will, and even top-tier singers couldn’t control it. The "god of song" failed. The elevator made a "ding" sound as the door opened. Jiang Dang thought about his earlier actions and suddenly found it a bit amusing, curling his lips into a slight smile.
 

 
When he entered the community, Tong Zhao received the message. As soon as the elevator door opened, she went to the hallway to greet him.
 

 
"You’re here."
 

 
His mask covered the lower half of his face, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see his smile, only a pair of eyes that looked dangerously charming. For a moment, she thought he was going to push her against the wall and kiss her...
 

 
Of course, that didn’t happen.
 

 
Jiang Dang swiftly removed his hat and mask, his eyes shining brightly as he looked at her.
 

 
He took a step forward... then another...
 

 
And then, he knelt down.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "...Huh?"
 

 
What is he doing?!
 

 
Why is he giving such a huge gesture for no reason?
 

 
She would have been less surprised if he had pushed her against the wall and kissed her.
 

 
Jiang Dang supported himself against the wall, his voice faint but tinged with a hint of grievance: "I’m so tired..."
 

 
He had been holding it together, but once he saw Tong Zhao, the excitement that had been keeping him going just broke, and his legs went soft. Tong Zhao helped him to the sofa, poured him a cup of warm water, and when she placed it on the coffee table, she realized he had already fallen asleep, his eyelashes casting a small, fan-shaped shadow. He looked like the villainous final boss in a mobile game, even sleeping like a bad guy.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s schedule was easy to check. Tong Zhao asked his agent a couple of questions and soon found out that he had been running himself ragged.
 

 
During the promotional tour for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Jiang Dang was always the one who loved sleep the most. His sleep time was squeezed by the busy promotional schedule, and he always looked gloomy with a heavy, low-pressure mood. However, he never took out his frustration on anyone and obediently followed the schedule.
 

 
Tong Zhao stood by the sofa for a moment, thinking, then decided to carry him to the guest room, tuck him in, turn off the lights, and go to the study to continue her meditation and training.
 

 
Jiang Dang slept all the way through until the next morning.
 

 
When he woke up in an unfamiliar environment, he was initially disoriented, unsure of where or when he was. After a moment, he regained his bearings and accepted his confusion calmly. After washing up in the guest room's private bathroom, he slowly walked out to the living room, where he saw Tong Zhao using the treadmill by the floor-to-ceiling window. He greeted her:
 

 
"Have you had breakfast? If not, I’ll go make it."
 

 
Jiang Dang hadn’t forgotten that his purpose for coming was to have a meal together.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded, pointing him toward the open kitchen.
 

 
Bathing in the morning sunlight, Tong Zhao was dressed in tight workout clothes that accentuated her graceful figure. Jiang Dang didn’t look at her much and went straight to the kitchen, as though he was really just there to cook.
 

 
The fridge was well-stocked with ingredients.
 

 
Tong Zhao ran with her back to the room, listening to the rhythmic sounds of Jiang Dang preparing food: chopping on the cutting board, turning on the stove, pouring oil, and stir-frying. Everything was organized and orderly. Even though she didn’t look back, Tong Zhao believed that he really knew how to cook.
 

 
Even if his cooking skills were average, she would pretend it tasted delicious, considering the effort he put in.
 

 
After finishing her workout, Tong Zhao took a shower and changed clothes. When she came out, she saw the table full of prepared dishes. They weren’t necessarily gourmet, but they looked decent. To her surprise, they tasted quite normal—just like a home-cooked breakfast.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I don’t usually make dishes like this."
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: "Seems like you really enjoy cooking."
 

 
"I do," he replied.
 

 
When it came to the incident where he had gotten so tired he kneeled last night, Jiang Dang just said straight out: "On the plane and in the car, I kept thinking about seeing you next. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. Then, when I finally saw you, I was so happy that my mind went blank and I almost blacked out."
 

 
He sighed: "These dishes don’t even showcase my cooking skills..."
 

 
Tong Zhao became more interested when she heard this. Since she had nothing else to do all day, she didn’t mind waiting for another meal later.
 

 
Jiang Dang, hearing her interest, laughed and happily said he would make her lunch.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao thought about it, she could only say that trouble came from her own words.
 

 
After breakfast, they played some games in the game room. Jiang Dang wasn’t good at shooting games. When they played ‘PUBG’, he would randomly wander off, fall behind, and get distracted by collecting trash. Tong Zhao told him not to bother with the useless stuff, but he kept promising and then died in strange places. After that, she went over to rummage through his loot box—
 

 
Turns out, it was full of garbage.
 

 
Compared to his terrible ‘PUBG’ skills, Jiang Dang was much better at playing the support role in ‘MOBA’ games. Not only did he have great map awareness, but he could also execute perfect team fights in the most bizarre ways, outsmarting the enemy with ease.
 

 
Tong Zhao observed for a while and noticed that his hero pool in ‘Honor of Kings’ included Lu Ban Master, Guiguzi, and Da Qiao. In ‘League of Legends’, it was Thresh, Bard, and Rakan—all heroes that, when played well, could carry the game, but when played poorly, could end up helping the enemy team instead. As she played, she did a psychological profile of him in her head.
 

 
He was a support player with a lot of creativity and imagination. He seemed clueless and naive, but in reality, he had strong control and aggression. As soon as the enemy made a small positioning mistake, he would seize the opportunity to deal a lot of damage. After he wore them down, the enemy's support and ADC would be completely suppressed, unable to do anything for the rest of the match.
 

 
Some people had already lost the lane, but the game didn’t really end until the crystal exploded.
 

 
He needed to control the situation, especially wanting to set the pace of the game.
 

 
He also liked to silently taunt the opponents, flashing emotes or signs to annoy them.
 

 
The more she watched, the more she felt that he resembled an animal.
 

 
When she saw him play a support hero and toy with the enemy's low-health carry, giving them hope and then delivering the finishing blow, followed by an emote on the enemy’s corpse, she finally remembered what kind of animal he reminded her of—
 

 
It was an orca!
 

 
Seemingly cute and clumsy, but actually very ruthless and loves to play with its prey.
 

 
With a single flick of its tail, it knocks out a seal, waits for it to wake up, then slaps it again and swallows it like a pancake.
 

 
The enemy ADC was furious, thinking he was a female player since he was playing Janna, a female champion, and called him a "bitch."
 

 
[Everyone] Jungle, do something! (Storm Spirit): *Whining sound*
 

 
...
 

 
How annoying!
 

 
That's right, orcas also make a whining sound.
 

 
After playing for three hours, Jiang Dang said he was going to prepare food. Tong Zhao was a little confused about why it would take so long to prepare a meal, but she didn’t stop him. She nodded and went to the study to work on the script. Even just reading the synopses of all the scripts Sister Chu had given her would take a long time.
 

 
...
 

 
"The meal is ready.”
 

 
With breakfast as a prelude, Tong Zhao felt fairly confident about Jiang Dang's cooking.
 

 
When she saw the dishes on the table, she was a bit surprised.
 

 
It was clear that Jiang Dang had put in some serious effort. The dishes were elegantly presented on large porcelain plates, aiming for the look of a Michelin-star restaurant.
 

 
She smiled and sat down. "You're really good at cooking."
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up a small tomato that looked like an appetizer.
 

 
When she bit into it, something felt off.
 

 
The inside of the tomato had been hollowed out and filled with meat juice and king oyster mushrooms. The combination achieved a balance of sweet and sour on the outside, and savory on the inside. The skin was cool, while the filling was hot.
 

 
Next, she ate what appeared to be a pie.
 

 
The jelly-like substance on the pie crust was transparent, but when it entered her mouth, it was unmistakably mango-flavored.
 

 
Finally, Tong Zhao thought the pasta was the main course, but it was actually made of chocolate.
 

 
And there was a sunny-side-up egg.
 

 
You'd think it was an egg, right?
 

 
No, the yolk was made of mango, and the egg white was specially treated cream.
 

 
Jiang Dang rested his chin on his hand, staring at her intently with his beautifully expressive eyes, not even blinking, full of anticipation. Tong Zhao knew how much effort had gone into preparing these unusual dishes, so out of courtesy, she ate everything.
 

 
To be honest, it wasn’t bad.
 

 
But after finishing this meal, the trust between people had clearly been shattered.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked her for her thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave her review: "Seeing the mountain isn’t seeing the mountain, seeing the water isn’t seeing the water."
 

 
Jiang Dang took it as a compliment, his eyes narrowing as he smiled, looking inexplicably happy, as if he was about to make a pleased "whining" sound…
 

 
Wait, she really did make him sound like an orca.
 

 
After the meal, Tong Zhao thought he would say something, but he didn’t.
 

 
She told him to just put the dirty dishes in the kitchen; there would be a cleaner coming regularly to take care of it.
 

 
Tong Zhao had all kinds of musical instruments at home. Jiang Dang performed a personal concert for her, then said he had to go for another engagement, leaving without doing or saying anything else.
 

 
The song he sang was quite nice, with a catchy, slightly addictive melody.
 

 
She wanted to download it, but couldn't find it online.
 

 
Two days later, Jiang Dang's official company-managed account posted a snippet from one of his new album singles for listening, and it was the exact same song he had sung for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The comments were full of praise: "Wow, so dedicated! He remembered to release a song before going on the variety show, a brand-new single we've never heard before!"
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had already heard it two days ago.
 

 
@Jiang Dangv: "Encrypted Love”
 

 
---
 

 
On the third day, after enjoying a relaxing break, Tong Zhao packed up and headed to the filming location.
 

 
Zhao Zai was quite excited, running around in the palace of her consciousness.
 

 
This made Consort Chen a bit annoyed, so she suggested, "Why don't I take over? I won't play the child, I'll play the parent. I could steal away all the fathers and give the children a brand-new stepmother."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "I advise the Consort to be kind."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so anxious that she slapped her knee.
 

 
Consort Chen was joking, and Tong Zhao didn’t take it seriously. The production team had used her childhood modeling from ‘Neverland Girl’, and after placing Zhao Zai into the main personality’s role, she closed her eyes.
 

 
Her consciousness sank deep into a very profound place.
# Chapter118
"Baby Chaos" is a live-streamed variety show based on instincts.
 

 
After all the guests’ consciousness enters the modeling of the holographic space, the live broadcast from the outside world also enters its countdown phase.
 

 
The host introduces the big guest of this episode.
 

 
Jiang Dang was given a lot of attention in the promotional materials.
 

 
After all, in recent years, whenever he releases a song, it becomes a hit. His songs are heard everywhere, on the streets and alleys, and also on platforms like Kuaishou and Douyin.
 

 
The funniest part is that some listeners look down on him, thinking that all his songs are just catchy pop tunes, calling them overly commercial. They think that an original musician named "Si Bian" is the real artist with true aspirations... But just before New Year's Eve, it was revealed that Si Bian's account was actually Jiang Dang's alternate account, where he posted niche, experimental music that was hard to recognize at first due to the subtle tuning of his voice.
 

 
He has the face of an idol, but does the work of a pure creative artist.
 

 
[With a fanbase like his, it might be better to put him in the small guest category. I’m really worried about him taking care of the kid…]
 

 
[Fortunately, it's an instinctive variety show, so even if things aren’t handled perfectly, nothing major will happen.]
 

 
[Your song "Encrypted Love Words" went viral on Douyin again. I get on the subway for work, and someone is blasting it over the speakers. It actually sounds pretty good.]
 

 
The second guest, Zhang Shi, is subconsciously seen in the industry as the "honest guy professional." Many viewers, when they see his face, immediately think his wife has either already cheated on him or is about to. He’s been labeled as someone born to wear the “green hat” (a Chinese metaphor for being cheated on)—
 

 
No one likes to hear such evaluations, but because of this unremarkable feature, he has gained many performance opportunities, standing out among the "honest guys," and earned his first pot of gold. Therefore, he often says that he doesn’t mind.
 

 
At the age of 35, Zhang Shi is still single.
 

 
There are rumors in the industry that when he was filming an instinctive movie, after repeatedly being "cheated on," he was unable to approach relationships anymore. In fact, this is true. He has sought help from professional psychologists, and the doctor suggested that since this has affected the trajectory of his life, he should switch to a different kind of role.
 

 
However, in the projects that invited him, playing the “honest guy” is the highest-paying role.
 

 
Between money and marriage, Zhang Shi, who still harbors lingering fears about the latter, decisively transformed his sorrow and anger into strength, walking further and further down the "honest guy" path. The gimmick for this appearance on the show was also "This might be the only chance for the audience to see Zhang Shi taking care of a child," and the most popular comment on that Weibo post was—
 

 
[So, he's not even taking care of his own kid?]
 

 
That comment went viral and was liked until next year.
 

 
The third guest, female artist Long Fei, is always full of energy. Her team has her show up in grand fashion at every event. Her flaw has always been overdoing it—she tries too hard to outshine everyone else. For this show, she even had a press release claiming she was going to compete with Tong Zhao in terms of looks.
 

 
The fourth guest, Xie Zihan, is interesting. She’s a trainee who came from a talent show. After debuting at a high rank, she immediately felt a huge sense of disparity. During the competition, she already felt the intense competition, but after debuting and competing in the entire entertainment industry, she immediately realized how cruel and unfair life could be. She then obediently followed the company's orders, listened closely to her manager, and because her face resembled Tong Zhao’s to some degree, and she was especially good at sports, being surprisingly strong and agile among female idols, the press started calling her “Little Tong Zhao.”
 

 
In fact, the two have some background.
 

 
Xie Zihan debuted through the talent show "Star Selection Girls," the same season as Xu Zhu.
 

 
Her manager put a lot of effort into arranging this appearance on the show, hoping she could ride on Tong Zhao’s popularity.
 

 
"Fifth guest, Ye Fanxiao, from 'Dancing Youth Team,' who previously starred in a campus superpower-themed instinctive TV drama…"
 

 
The introduction continued for a while.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao, like Xie Zihan, also debuted through a talent show.
 

 
However, he was luckier. After debuting, he landed a role in a supernatural idol drama. Although due to limited funding, they chose a much cheaper traditional drama, it still gained some attention in a small scope. After all, the short clips from the drama that were widely shared on Weibo couldn't have been all holographic.
 

 
With the support of his fans, Ye Fanxiao landed a role in a relatively high-investment instinctive movie. Though not the lead, he played the second male lead. The movie’s promotion happened to overlap with "Neverland Girl," so he was included in all the promotional announcements, getting a lot of exposure, which led to this individual booking for the holographic variety show.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao’s public persona is proud and cold.
 

 
His subconscious personality is reserved, a bit of a "chuunibyou" (youthful delusion), and he loves to act cool. The characters he plays fit the mold perfectly…
 

 
The bullet comments exploded.
 

 
It wasn’t because Ye Fanxiao’s momentum was strong or his fame was high.
 

 
Half of the guests for "Baby Chaos" had been announced, while the other half had not.
 

 
The audience watching the live stream was waiting for Tong Zhao to appear, thinking it was normal for her to be the final guest, given her status.
 

 
But as they kept waiting…
 

 
All the big guests had already been introduced??
 

 
They introduced the small guest!
 

 
Where’s Tong Zhao?
 

 
The official Weibo promoted Tong Zhao so heavily, where did she go?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were the first to get upset.
 

 
After all, the official Weibo had promoted Tong Zhao, so her fans naturally worked hard to promote ‘Baby Chaos’, spreading the word and recommending it everywhere. Generally speaking, the first half of the live-streamed instinctive variety show is free, to attract viewers. Fans didn’t think too much about it—if they said their "sister" would appear, they just directly bought the viewing rights without hesitation.
 

 
They had paid and put in the effort.
 

 
But now the host is saying there's no Tong Zhao?
 

 
This vague and misleading promotion to gain fans is even worse. No fan would tolerate it. Even though Tong Zhao's fans were usually laid-back, they flooded the official comment section with criticism, and most bystanders could understand why. Lying is unethical, and fans had paid money specifically for Tong Zhao—this is false advertising.
 

 
Girls in fan circles, aside from anything else, are really fast at typing.
 

 
A massive barrage of question marks flooded the entire screen, which was quite spectacular.
 

 
Audience members who had been paying attention to the pre-show promotions could already feel the storm brewing from the fans' anger. Some fans of Ye Fanxiao, who were more observant, quietly kept their mouths shut, not daring to appear too happy in the comments. They murmured to themselves...
 

 
“Is our brother going to replace Xiao Zhao’s position?”
 

 
“No way, right? He’s not that good, is he?”
 

 
“If he were that good, wouldn’t our Fan Shao have been placed at the center position a long time ago? He should’ve debuted with a clear lead!”
 

 
Whispering.jpg
 

 
Whimpering.jpg
 

 
The anger reached its peak, and just as the fans were about to unleash a barrage of insults aimed at the show’s director…
 

 
The live-stream screen showed a fair, smooth sleeping face.
 

 
The big guests and small guests had different starting points.
 

 
The big guests were in a living room with sofas and coffee tables.
 

 
The small guest’s starting point looked like a kindergarten playroom, with soft woolen mats covering the floor. Colorful pillows were stacked into small mountains, and even the corners of a one-meter-high bookshelf were padded for safety.
 

 
A little girl, around six years old, was lying on her side on the pillow mountain.
 

 
The girl’s jet-black long hair was spread behind her, and her soft, pink little face looked like a glutinous rice ball. Her rosy, plump lips were like jelly, and she looked so delicious. When the camera zoomed in, her long, curled eyelashes fluttered, and this angelic sleeping face made even the most furious fans hesitate for a moment before pressing the send button on the comments, afraid of disturbing the little angel’s sleep…
 

 
However, there was another layer to this.
 

 
This… this… this…
 

 
Isn’t this just ‘Xiao Zhao’s’ character from ‘Neverland Girl’?
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans and the audience's minds went blank, and in an instant, the comments section was flooded with thousands of exclamations.
 

 
Some fans, too quick to react, sent out insults but quickly corrected themselves with lightning-fast fingers.
 

 
As a result, the comments turned into a chorus of "realizing" moments:
 

 
[The show team is treating us like fools!]
 

 
[How could anyone come up with such a genius move? Amazing! Love you, mom, mua.]
 

 
[Director Sima, come out here!]
 

 
[Flatter me! ps. Sima refers to the director, not Sima Yi.]
 

 
[Take out my Italian cannon!]
 

 
[Let's set off some fireworks for the director of the show to cheer him up!]
 

 
This drifting speed—if Takumi Fujiwara were here, he’d have to bow in respect.
 

 
Who could watch this and not say that Sichuan Opera’s face-changing technique is really amazing?
 

 
The barrage of comments about face-changing stunned other viewers, with quick-handed fans taking screenshots and posting them on Weibo to share with friends, all laughing together. Netizens who understood the situation were also very sympathetic, joking about [the director’s mom being pushed to the Naihe Bridge, with fans performing a dramatic scene of pulling her back from the underworld after spitting out the Meng Po soup, treating her like royalty at a lavish banquet]. Some said the production team deserved the criticism, but it was definitely part of their promotional strategy—creating a twist to generate buzz and topic heat.
 

 
Then, netizens started wondering: ‘How did Tong Zhao turn into a little kid?’
 

 
Of course, fans rushed to explain.
 

 
---
 

 
“Guest #1, Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“In reality, she’s a famous actress with box office earnings in the billions. She became famous at a young age and has more fame and experience than her peers. She’s been surrounded by scandals and was once a controversial figure, holding the top spot on Baidu's female celebrity index for an entire year.”
 

 
“With the help of a time machine, she’s turned back into a little child and is now joining our list of guests.”
 

 
“The production team has adjusted her age with some technical tricks, but her subconscious is uncontrollable. When this little angel with a sweet face wakes up, what kind of surprises will she bring to our show?”
 

 
As the host's introduction ended, he said, “Let’s gather 10,000 likes to wake Xiao Zhao up!”
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, a button appeared on the live stream.
 

 
This interactive segment was one of the highlights of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
Having a "cloud" interaction with a little glutinous rice ball was an unimaginable joy!
 

 
With the sound effect of [deng deng deng deng deng], the like bar quickly filled up and overflowed.
 

 
A cute version of Mickey Mouse’s hand appeared out of nowhere in the air and gently poked Xiao Zhao’s cheek.
 

 
Her cotton-candy-like cheek dented slightly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao, poked in her sleep, furrowed her brows and pouted her soft lips.
 

 
The white hand was about to poke again when Xiao Zhao flipped over, burying her cheek into the pillow, refusing to be poked.
 

 
However, the merciless production team poked her on the back of the head.
 

 
Xiao Zhao mumbled something in her sleep, and due to being unclear, the audience only heard a very sweet-sounding "um-mee."
 

 
[Awsl—! Medic! Where’s the medic?]
 

 
[I want her to keep sleeping, but I also want to poke her and see her reaction. I’m a sinner!]
 

 
[I’m saving this episode to watch over and over again, ahhhh, I hate it, when will they release a pet like Xiao Zhao? I want to raise her, qwq.]
 

 
The entire barrage was filled with fans wanting to "cloud-raise" Xiao Zhao.
 

 
When the production team saw that the cuteness was working, they really flipped Xiao Zhao over and twisted her cheek.
 

 
They twisted it hard, lifting one side of her tofu-like cheek upward.
 

 
The audience was shocked to discover that the tofu had turned into soft, chewy, rice cake-like skin—
 

 
[Excuse me, should we increase the intensity?]
 

 
[Yes/No].
# Chapter119
[Yes/No]
 

 
Xiao Zhao is so cute, how can they bully her!
 

 
This is what the barrage is saying.
 

 
However, in reality, the number of votes for [Yes] skyrocketed at an unbelievable speed.
 

 
Generally speaking, in interactive variety shows like this, the fans of the guests would coordinate their actions to ensure the maximum benefit for their beloved star.
 

 
But...
 

 
[No no no, poking Xiao Zhao's face hurts the mother's heart.]
 

 
[What does flipping my child over mean?! Let her sleep if she's tired!]
 

 
[This is too cruel, are you still human? Press 'Yes' hard!]
 

 
[Will she cry? Press 'Yes' if she will cry, and press 'Yes' even if she won’t /dog head.]
 

 
— Xiao Zhao's cloud mommy and cloud daddy can't come to an agreement!
 

 
The fake hand in the air poked Xiao Zhao’s face again.
 

 
She still kept her eyes closed, but raised her hand and waved it in the air, surprisingly managing to grab the finger of that annoying fake hand with her round Doraemon hand.
 

 
#Clever Xiao Zhao refusing to get out of bed.#
 

 
[Hahahaha, she's the smartest baby to her mommy!]
 

 
[Oh my God, was Tong Zhao this cute when she was little? Or does she still look like this now?]
 

 
[I've never seen this side of Tong Zhao. Whenever she attends public events... she always gives off this strong, independent vibe? I never imagined she had such a baby side!]
 

 
My heart is melting.
 

 
The production team didn’t expect Xiao Zhao's subconscious to love sleeping in so much. They quickly controlled the fake hand to escape Xiao Zhao's grip. The special effects team added a panicked sound effect, and to everyone's surprise, another fake hand appeared in mid-air. The two hands gently rubbed Xiao Zhao's cheeks—
 

 
Just like rubbing a cat, they rubbed Xiao Zhao!
 

 
"Ugh..."
 

 
This time, Xiao Zhao was really poked awake.
 

 
Since this is a variety show, children are unaware of the camera's presence and often can't control their temper. Audiences who are used to this type of show are more understanding of the little guests and won’t engage in vicious online bullying. The edited version of the show will intentionally reduce the audience's dislike for the mischievous kids by using editing techniques.
 

 
This approach received quite a bit of praise.
 

 
The director was very aware that having boundaries is necessary for long-term success.
 

 
The show is meant to be heartwarming, funny, and adorable. While provoking controversy might generate buzz in the short term, over time people won’t want to see kids on the show. The association would also issue warnings.
 

 
So, did Xiao Zhao get mad after being woken up?
 

 
The audience was really curious to see Xiao Zhao get angry.
 

 
She’s usually so perfect, without much to criticize. Her fans admire her from a distance, seeing her as a big star who’s not like someone who’s only been in the industry for a little over a year. Her dazzling achievements and illustrious titles are quite fitting. But the thing is, people’s attitudes toward stars are strange—if she always shows a perfect image, even the rare moments when she’s soft and vulnerable make people want to protect her.
 

 
Don’t ask, just want to ‘rua’ (squeeze/cuddle).
 

 
"I want to sleep..."
 

 
The top-notch recording equipment allowed the audience to hear her sweet, milk-like complaint very clearly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao opened her eyes.
 

 
The fake hand wasn’t very forceful when it rubbed her face earlier, but who would have thought her skin was so delicate? After being rubbed, the corner of her eye faintly turned red, and her bright, moist deer-like eyes angrily stared at the fake hand. The camera was set up behind the fake hand, and the audience was terrified by the intensity of her glare.
 

 
Xiao Zhao pouted and grabbed the culprit, not letting it go: "You bullied me, I’m telling mommy."
 

 
#First to report to mommy#
 

 
[Mom’s here! Mommy loves you! Director, come out and face your death!]
 

 
[Too much sweetness, sob sob sob, Xiao Zhao come to mommy’s arms and cry]
 

 
[Those who say mommy protects you must’ve voted 'yes' earlier.]
 

 
Some viewers thought about Xiao Zhao's father’s character and understood why she only goes to her mother when she's being bullied—what about her mom? Some veteran fans explained that Xiao Zhao only debuted after her mother passed away. However, she usually doesn’t talk about this; when reporters asked, she would downplay it and not give much of a response, as if she was indifferent about family ties.
 

 
But looking at how attached she is to her mom—can her family ties really be indifferent?
 

 
Xiao Zhao's grip was surprisingly strong, and the fake hand couldn't break free right away, eventually disappearing helplessly into thin air.
 

 
"Eh?"
 

 
Xiao Zhao couldn't believe it and reached out again into thin air.
 

 
Naturally, she grabbed nothing. There was nothing there.
 

 
Next, it was time to wake up the other little guests.
 

 
As everyone knows, when entering the holographic shooting, the transition of consciousness doesn't happen instantly. The stronger and broader the brain domain, the faster a person wakes up. That’s why, when filming survival variety shows, Xiao Zhao always woke up earlier than the others.
 

 
And this time was no different.
 

 
The host was about to wake up the other little guests when Xiao Zhao flipped off the pillow mountain and hopped twice to stretch her arms and legs. The other three little guests were scattered in different parts of the room.
 

 
Xiao Zhao raised her head.
 

 
The audience was confused, thinking she was about to do some aerobics. Just then, when the camera cut to wake up another little boy, Xiao Zhao took three steps with a ‘thud’ and skillfully grabbed the fake hand.
 

 
She had been observing, waiting for the hand that kept poking her face to appear!
 

 
"You can’t bully the other kids."
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s serious expression looked just like a kindergarten leader.
 

 
[Our Xiao Zhao has been domineering since she was little!]
 

 
[Give Xiao Zhao a cigarette... no, a lollipop!]
 

 
[Don’t say anything, the bottle is filled with white wine, full to the top. After drinking it, let out a big milk burp.]
 

 
The production team had no choice but to send a nanny from the holographic show into the room. She crouched down and gently explained to Xiao Zhao that it was time for the kids to leave school, and if they didn’t wake up, their parents would be waiting outside for a long time. Unexpectedly, Xiao Zhao accepted the explanation and didn’t stop the nanny from waking up the other little guest, sitting quietly on the side instead.
 

 
Even though she didn’t know the cameras were filming, Xiao Zhao still sat very quietly and well-behaved, without making any extra movements. Her calm little face subtly showed the future star power she would have. Fans suddenly realized that Xiao Zhao had been a well-behaved angel since she was young.
 

 
I really want to take her home and raise her, she looks so easy to handle.
 

 
This time, there were five adults, but only four little guests.
 

 
So, one of the little guests could choose to be taken care of by two adults.
 

 
The variety show had many strange settings. Due to the codes placed at more fundamental positions, the guests accepted these bizarre settings as naturally as they would accept that one plus one equals two. Next came the part where the children and parents chose each other.
 

 
Since it was the first episode, the host interviewed both the adult and child guests about what kind of guardian and child they would like to have.
 

 
When asked, Zhang Shi spoke with slight sorrow:
 

 
"What kind of child? One like mine, someone who looks like they’re my biological child at first glance, that would be great."
 

 
The show was playing to its maximum effect.
 

 
Zhang Shi had played many roles of honest, straightforward people.
 

 
Although playing the same type of character in ‘Instinct Films’ was common, it did bring some psychological issues. For example, Zhang Shi, who had never been betrayed in reality, was subconsciously affected by these thoughts.
 

 
The glamorous Long Fei didn’t seem like she was there to pick up a child, but more like she was there to perform. She explicitly said: "Can I want whatever I like? Then I want a beautiful and talented child, one who can get first place."
 

 
Just as the audience was about to develop a negative impression, the host asked her what if the child was unattractive and not very smart?
 

 
Long Fei answered nonchalantly: "I’ll still raise them. What am I supposed to do, put them back in my stomach and redo them? No? If they’re ugly, I’ll just make more money. If you have money, you won’t be ugly."
 

 
The other female guest, Xie Zihan, couldn’t answer the question.
 

 
She was only twenty years old and hadn’t thought about having children.
 

 
"I’d be a bit scared of not taking care of the child properly."
 

 
"I’d like to team up with the other parents later."
 

 
In contrast to her lively and bright appearance on the talent show, Xie Zihan’s subconscious was a bit reserved and shy. Her manager was visibly restless—on the show, she and Xiao Zhao shared some similarities, but in ‘Instinct Variety’, she was completely different.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao shrugged: "I can take care of myself."
 

 
That answer was pretty unreliable.
 

 
But Ye Fanxiao, at 25, was still in the prime of his career in the entertainment industry. Men in this field typically have a longer golden period, and he still carried the "little fresh meat" label, adopting the cool, charismatic, and rebellious persona. So, this response was expected.
 

 
Moreover, there was still Jiang Dang behind him.
 

 
The audience felt that his answer would be even more unreliable.
 

 
This was also why the host had arranged for him to be last. They felt he had a good sense of humor.
 

 
...
 

 
"Children?"
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the sofa, his long legs casually draped over the armrest.
 

 
When he heard the host’s question, he shifted his gaze and, as he looked at the host, he unknowingly made eye contact with the camera behind him. His eyes held a cool, captivating gleam, and with his voice, which seemed to exude desire to the extreme, he said something that even a dog wouldn’t want to hear:
 

 
“I want someone who can take care of me.”
 

 
A question mark filled the entire live broadcast screen.
 

 
The host, unable to believe it, repeated his words: “Take care of you? Mr. Jiang, this... this doesn’t seem right.”
 

 
You’re a charming and aloof villain, expecting innocent and cute children to take care of you.
 

 
Is this okay? It’s not okay.
 

 
“What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Jiang Dang was genuinely surprised, having never thought that his words might be inappropriate. It seemed as though the host’s implied criticism had struck a nerve, and he slightly lowered his eyelashes, casting a soft shadow over his cold, fair skin: “My agent knows. I’m very obedient and easy to handle.”
 

 
At home, his agent was so furious that they reached for an emergency heart-saving pill.
 

 
They shouldn’t have agreed to let him appear on ‘Instinct Variety’.
 

 
Acting is one thing; you can always use “character settings” to brush it off, but this was clearly a glimpse of his true nature!
 

 
And he’s easy to handle, huh?
 

 
His agent was anxious, but it didn’t cause much of a stir among Jiang Dang’s fans.
 

 
After all, it wasn’t the first time he’d been unreliable. He wasn’t even married in real life, so it’s not like he was being irresponsible toward actual children. He doesn’t care about creating a persona and focuses on making hit love songs, occasionally showing his face. That’s enough for him.
 

 
This answer strangely stirred up some maternal instincts in certain female fans, who suddenly wanted to take care of him.
 

 
It can only be said that as long as you have good looks, you can always spark affection in unexpected ways.
 

 
The host was struggling: “So, Mr. Jiang, you want to find someone who can take care of you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head: “I’d like to think that, but that kind of thing doesn’t happen.” The handsome guy looked even more troubled, and the audience laughed so hard they almost fell over. So, it turns out he has some common sense after all. They had thought he really wanted to find a little baby to take care of a silly dad.
 

 
“As long as they can look at me,”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled slightly: “They’re my child.”
 

 
— My, child.
 

 
The last two words, “child,” were pronounced with emphasis. What should have been a completely serious statement was instead delivered like a tender love confession.
 

 
The female audience couldn’t laugh anymore.
 

 
Originally, the audience watched him like they would watch a silly kid, but now they couldn’t handle it anymore. Their preferences were under attack, and their ears were ringing!
 

 
[Ahhh, I want to be Brother Dang’s child, Dang, come to me head-on!]
 

 
[Looks aren’t important, it’s his voice, ah, I really want to do ‘kkp’ with him.]
 

 
[‘kkp’? What does that mean?]
 

 
[Stop posting such comments on a variety show that kids are watching!!]
 

 
The topic of ‘kkp’ was dropped there.
 

 
The agent’s worries about cleaning up his fan base were unnecessary. Jiang Dang didn’t think appearing on this show would cause him any problems. He was clearly a sensible and mature adult. After the interview, the caregiver led the four kids out of the game room...
 

 
A string of kids.
 

 
Zhao Zai was walking in the front, holding hands with a boy and a girl on either side.
 

 
The little girl had a flower bud hairstyle, and her round face was framed by a pair of bright, lively eyes. She was a bit shy, tightly holding onto Zhao Zai’s hand. The other boy was also about six years old, and seemed a bit nervous.
 

 
There was only one young boy with brown hair, walking with his hands behind his back, lingering at the back.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t want to interact with anyone.
 

 
Black hair and black eyes are dominant genes, so having blonde hair and blue eyes was unlikely. But the mixed-race little Noah took after his father. His hair was lighter in color, with large eyes, long lashes, and a high nose. He looked like a second-generation star with the right genes, combining the softness of an Easterner with the deep contours of a Germanic person. If you looked closely, his eyes even had a gentle blue hue, and he looked like a child from an oil painting.
 

 
Good-looking people have privileges.
 

 
Even though he acted aloof, as soon as he appeared, he immediately captured the hearts of many fans who loved good looks, with people calling him the perfect little boy of their dreams.
 

 
However, what more people were curious about was what happened in the room earlier. Why were the two little kids sticking to their "big mother hen" Zhao Zai like chicks sticking to their mother hen?
 

 
Those who were watching the live broadcast from the kids’ side explained in the comments—
 

 
[In short, it’s the scene of picking up little brothers.]
 

 
＊
 

 
Let’s rewind to ten minutes ago.
 

 
The caregiver was interviewing the kids about what kind of parents they wanted.
 

 
In the kids' subconscious, their memories of their mom and dad were temporarily blocked, making them feel like they were being born again, choosing their own parents to spend seven days with. However, after Jia Jia and Xiao Quan woke up, they were still in a panic, pouting and wanting to cry, and even the caregiver’s comforting hugs didn’t help.
 

 
When Zhao Zai walked over, held their hands, and softly coaxed them, it worked.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Viewers analyzed that, for young children, adults are like beings from another level, and the caregiver’s comfort only scratched the surface. When Jia Jia saw another little boy on the verge of tears, she wanted to cry too. But when she saw Zhao Zai...
 

 
“There are so many pillows here,” Zhao Zai naturally took her hand and spoke, “It feels a little smaller than the kindergarten I used to go to. Did you sleep enough just now?”
 

 
The little girl had tears in her eyes and nodded dumbly.
 

 
The little boy who had been on the verge of crying earlier watched her calmly, as if he had found a pillar of support. He also came over and wanted to hold her hand: “I... I didn’t sleep enough!”
 

 
“Well, we can find another chance to nap later,”
 

 
Life isn’t easy, Zhao Zai sighed: “I didn’t sleep enough either.”
 

 
[Look at what you two have done!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao must be really busy with work. She always appears so energetic in public, but it turns out she has such a sleepy side behind the scenes. Adorable beauty.]
 

 
[What’s the deal with this little boy holding my girl’s hand? Zhao Zai can’t have an early crush, I won’t let this little brat take advantage, her dad won’t allow it!]
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand much about how to speak to others.
 

 
Consort Chen knows how to flirt, Duan Ge can mix both kindness and authority, and Shuyi knows how to coax people...
 

 
Adults have many tricks and techniques.
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t know any of that, but she was simply the most dazzling kid in kindergarten.
 

 
Some people are just born to be big shots.
 

 
The two little kids clung to Zhao Zai like accessories, while Noah, who had just woken up, stared at her with a displeased expression. His handsome face fell.
 

 
Two tigers can’t coexist on the same mountain!
# Chapter120
The two little children tightly held onto Zhao Zai's hand.
 

 
Perhaps because they now had a reliable support, they were not particularly interested in the other adults. When asked if they wanted to play games with any of the older brothers or sisters, they shook their heads vigorously.
 

 
The host had already anticipated this, so the living room was prepared with a lot of toys.
 

 
Children who appear on this kind of show don’t usually lack toys in real life, but no child would ever complain about having too many toys. It’s in their DNA to prefer new and exciting things. When the two of them saw three large boxes filled with various brightly colored toys, all new and shiny, their eyes immediately stuck to them.
 

 
Only Noah crossed his arms, looking disdainfully at the toys.
 

 
What’s so fun about these toy planes and boats?
 

 
The host, seeing this, immediately squatted down with a smile and asked, "If you don’t want to play games, would you like to play with the toys together with the older brothers and sisters?"
 

 
“Well… a little,” Jia Jia hesitated as she shook Zhao Zai’s hand.
 

 
The other boy whispered, "I want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jia Jia blinked her watery eyes once, worried about falling behind, and quickly agreed, "I also want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
So, who will Tong Zhao play with?
 

 
The audience was a little curious.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao debuted, there had been a few rumors about her, with some even calling her a "sea king." However, these were just rumors. Aside from Wei Zekai showing anxiety about possibly having dinner with Tong Zhao in her live stream, there had been no such rumors involving the other men.
 

 
If there was anything going on, would it be this peaceful?
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head to the left and bumped her head against Jia Jia’s. "I’ll play with you."
 

 
Then she tilted her head to the right, "You play too."
 

 
---
 

 
[True Master of Balancing Water]
 

 
[The Kindergarten "Sea King" Is Actually Right Next to Me]
 

 
[I Want to Stick with Zhao Zai, I Want to Play with Toys Too!]
 

 
At this moment, Noah loudly said, "What’s so fun about these toys for kids?"
 

 
As he spoke, he disdainfully turned up his nose at the toy box.
 

 
This time, the two little kids, who had been absorbed by the toys, were no longer happy.
 

 
Children’s unhappiness is written all over their faces. Although they didn’t start crying immediately, Noah’s words had already put him in the “we don’t want to play with him” category in their minds.
 

 
The host was about to console them when Zhao Zai turned her head to look at him.
 

 
Her eyes were a light shade, clear and bright, and even though she was so small, it was obvious she had a beautiful face. Noah, under her steady gaze, suddenly felt a bit anxious and short of breath…
 

 
This wasn’t the first time.
 

 
When he had woken up earlier in the game room and saw this child for the first time, his heart had skipped a beat in an uncomfortable way.
 

 
What does this mean?
 

 
It means they were natural enemies!
 

 
It’s like Ultraman seeing a monster.
 

 
It’s like the Black Cat Sheriff seeing a cat-eating rat.
 

 
It’s like the Calabash Brothers seeing the Snake Spirit!
 

 
Noah, feeling a sense of impending danger, said, "Why are you looking at me?"
 

 
"I was thinking…"
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her little head. "These are toys for kids, so we must be kids then."
 

 
This child doesn’t seem very bright.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Noah was momentarily speechless.
 

 
"What’s fun about these toy boats and planes? I don’t like them. If we’re going to play, let’s play with real planes and big ships." At this point, Noah’s expression turned smug. "Do you know what those are? They can carry a lot of people and fly in the sky or float on the water."
 

 
In the world of children, knowing more than your classmates is a big deal.
 

 
Of course, this logic tends to carry over to school and the workplace as well.
 

 
The audience in the live stream couldn’t help but marvel at the world of the rich.
 

 
Noah’s parents were wealthy, and in reality, they often traveled by private plane.
 

 
Although he had forgotten about this fact while participating in the variety show, his subconscious made it clear that they weren’t starting from the same place.
 

 
"Oh~"
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded seriously.
 

 
"Don’t mind him."
 

 
Jia Jia lightly tugged at Zhao Zai’s sleeve. Noah’s attitude made her feel uncomfortable.
 

 
After thinking it over, Zhao Zai really wanted to "borrow" Noah’s big plane and big ship:
 

 
"Can you bring them out and play with us?"
 

 
"How could I bring them out? I-I don’t have any… I was just saying, real planes and ships are much more fun. These toys for little kids aren’t interesting at all."
 

 
Noah thought what he said made a lot of sense.
 

 
But, loud as he was, his confidence started to waver.
 

 
"So you don’t have big planes and big ships, huh?" Zhao Zai sighed, her disappointment evident. "I thought you were really impressive."
 

 
...
 

 
"…Well, I’m still way better than you playing with these toys!"
 

 
If broken hearts could make a sound, it would be the frustrated voice of young Master Noah now. His pride shattered into pieces, and there was a slight hint of a sob in his voice.
 

 
Realizing his mental state was breaking down, Noah, to avoid crying in front of everyone, tightly pressed his lips together and sniffed. When he noticed Zhao Zai looked like she was about to say something else, he quickly braced himself and gave her a fierce glare—
 

 
What else was this annoying woman going to say to hurt him?
 

 
He had mentally prepared himself.
 

 
Zhao Zai, with a face full of hope, said, "Then you have to work hard to get a big ship and a big plane. If you get one, remember to take me to play!"
 

 
After saying that, she acted like the topic was over, pulling her two little followers to the seats arranged by the host. She sat gracefully and quietly, like a well-behaved little princess. Noah was caught off guard, stunned in place, before the nanny coaxed him into sitting down.
 

 
[Ah, this…]
 

 
[Look at the reaction of this little rich boy. Is he liking Zhao Zai?]
 

 
[Does a six-year-old even know what "liking" means?]
 

 
[Sigh, whether or not they understand "liking," it's definitely true that they are all about looks. My son only wants to lend his toys to classmates who look good, and he likes uncles and aunts who are good-looking. He’s always drawn to familiar faces.]
 

 
The audience couldn’t help but sigh that appreciating beauty is human nature.
 

 
The audience’s guess was pretty close, and Noah’s face didn’t hide anything.
 

 
But it wasn’t as pink and bubbly as the audience thought.
 

 
Noah wanted to be the center of attention, to have Zhao Zai admire him, and to express his superiority by belittling the toys they were playing with. When things didn’t go the way he expected, he became anxious and embarrassed. Because he was good-looking, Noah was somewhat of a child star. He was often flown around by his mother to attend events as part of her way of gaining publicity, which meant he had no fixed school to attend.
 

 
His father was wealthy and hired excellent tutors, so not only did Noah never fall behind in his studies, he even learned better than his peers.
 

 
However, this also meant he didn’t have much experience interacting with children his own age.
 

 
＊
 

 
With Zhao Zai’s active mediation, the two little followers who had been playing for a while finally weren’t so shy anymore. They understood that, although Tong Zhao was great, she was still just a child like them. She couldn’t be their guardian, and they still needed to choose a parent.
 

 
However, when it came to choosing a guardian, the two children still felt a bit reluctant.
 

 
Noah noticed how hesitant they were and felt a bit disgusted. He was thinking to himself, what could he do now to stand out? Why hadn’t anyone begged him to be their child yet?
 

 
At this moment, Zhao Zai’s sense of responsibility once again drove her to step forward.
 

 
“It’s actually not scary,”
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped off the sofa and confidently presented herself to everyone, her expression serious. She had a pair of beautiful eyes, her light-colored pupils misty and round, looking as innocent as a fawn’s eyes. But her high, elegant brow and nose gave her face a full, graceful look, the perfect prototype of a little beauty growing into a stunning one.
 

 
She lifted a bright smile:
 

 
“Is there anyone willing to be my guardian for a while?”
 

 
...
 

 
[I'll do it! I'll do it!]
 

 
[Be my baby forever, Zhao Zai is so well-behaved.]
 

 
[Seriously wondering why that lousy father would choose that little sister.]
 

 
Whether it was during the game earlier or in her current speech, Zhao Zai always gave off the impression that she was easy to take care of, which made the guests very drawn to her. Both Ye Xiaofan and Long Fei thought she was very suitable for them and started competing for her.
 

 
It was just a reality variety show.
 

 
Just like the "China’s Good Voice" segment where the guests compete for contestants, they always do so with genuine emotions. It’s the most authentic side of the guests' subconscious, and it’s exactly what the audience loves to see.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, true to form, made a disdainful face: “You wear such heavy makeup, can you really take care of a child?”
 

 
“You wear makeup too, so why criticize me?” Long Fei smirked. “Tong Zhao is a girl. It’s more appropriate for a female guardian to take care of her than a male one.”
 

 
...
 

 
This was something Ye Xiaofan hadn’t expected.
 

 
"Baby Chaos" didn’t actually have a rule that the gender of the guests had to match that of the child.
 

 
In real life, it’s hard to guarantee the boundaries of interactions between the opposite sex, but in the holographic world, it’s much easier to control. When guests participate in children’s shows, they sign contracts waiving certain privacy rights, allowing instruments to scan them and ensuring they have no tendencies toward pedophilia. This was taken to the utmost level in protecting children.
 

 
However, if the same guests were competing, there was an advantage to being the same gender.
 

 
For example, for younger children, or those who don’t have the habit of bathing alone, it’s necessary for a same-gender guest to take care of them.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, having been outmaneuvered, clicked his tongue in frustration.
 

 
The nice guy Zhang Shi and Xie Zihan saw that the two were getting into a competition and didn’t want to argue with them. Instead, they quietly started talking to the other two children.
 

 
Only Noah, who had been expected to be one of the highlights of the show, was ignored.
 

 
And what about Jiang Dang?
 

 
He seemed to have been offline for quite a while.
 

 
Fans were anxiously hoping that the older brother would grab more screen time, but upon reflection, they realized he didn’t really need this exposure. They sighed, thinking that wherever he ended up, it didn’t really matter. He probably didn’t care much about being stuck with the prickly Noah.
 

 
Just as Ye Xiaofan was in the middle of arguing with Long Fei, Jiang Dang unexpectedly sneakily made his way over to Zhao Zai’s side:
 

 
"Do you like listening to music?"
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively raised her hand and scratched her ear.
 

 
For some reason, whenever this man spoke, her ears felt itchy.
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
Jiang Dang lowered his head and gently hummed a few verses of a popular children's song, singing whatever was trending.
 

 
His voice was so catchy that even the two children who had been talking to Zhang Shi leaned in: “Brother, can you sing something else?”
 

 
“I can sing anything. What do you want to hear?”
 

 
“‘Blue Bird’! The theme song of ‘Naruto Shippuden’—do you know ‘Naruto’?”
 

 
Jiang Dang hummed a part of the Chinese version of the theme song, which totally mesmerized the kids.
 

 
After arguing with Long Fei for seven rounds, Ye Xiaofan finally sensed something was wrong.
 

 
He turned around to look.
 

 
Well, well, the bad guy wasn’t being honest, was he? Instead of talking, he was over there singing songs to amuse the children?
 

 
“Don’t listen to him, let me show you some dance moves.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had stood out in the competition because of his excellent street dance skills.
 

 
Saying that, he did a one-handed windmill spin right there on the spot.
 

 
This wasn’t something that had happened before. The segment, originally filled with warmth, had turned into a talent show, and the audience felt like they had somehow tuned into the neighboring show, ‘China’s New Dance King’.
 

 
The two kids were impressed by the cool move, and Zhao Zai looked up at Jiang Dang and asked, “Can you do that too?”
 

 
“…I can’t! Can you dance?”
 

 
“I can do ballet.”
 

 
Zhao Zai answered seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Then can you choose me to be your guardian, and teach me ballet?”
# Chapter121
What is going on here?
 

 
It’s like everyone else is pulling money out of their pockets, showing it to the little girl and saying, “If you follow me, I can give you a lot of money,” and then this guy jumps out and says, “Sister, give me some.”
 

 
[Hahahahahaha]
 

 
[You really can't predict what kind of crazy move he’ll pull next.]
 

 
[Can't do anything right, but top the list in talking. Looks like singing kids' songs to entertain children is his emotional intelligence highlight, thank goodness for that.]
 

 
The audience was laughing happily.
 

 
However, the next second, after thinking seriously, Zhao Zai asked, “Do you really want to learn? There are almost no boys in my class.”
 

 
Ballet, because of its tight-fitting costumes and graceful, feminine movements, is often regarded as a dance exclusively for girls. Not only in China, but even abroad, there have been cases of young boys who were bullied for learning ballet and even committed suicide because of it.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked in return: “Boys can’t learn ballet? Do you think it’s inappropriate?”
 

 
His tone didn’t sound like he was talking to a child, but more like discussing a phenomenon with a peer.
 

 
Zhao Zai thought for a moment, then seriously said in her sweet little voice: “You can, I don’t think it’s inappropriate. If you want to learn, I can teach you, but learning ballet is hard. I’m not a teacher, I can only tell you what the teacher taught me and repeat it to you~”
 

 
“Pinky promise?”
 

 
Jiang Dang reached out his hand, and Zhao Zai didn’t hesitate to place her much smaller hand in his, linking their fingers and giving a gentle shake.
 

 
This warm and friendly scene, however, was met with nothing but question marks in the comments section.
 

 
It can be called a large-scale online confusion scene.
 

 
[Zhao Zai——]
 

 
[LOL, I’m already feeling what it’s like for a girl to run off with an unreliable guy.]
 

 
[I’m all for the Dang-Zhao CP... but I bought the viewing rights expecting to see them together raising a cute kid, not Zhao Zai turning into the cute kid! The affection has warped! This is fatherly love!]
 

 
Some more rational viewers analyzed that this development actually made sense.
 

 
Others were performing talents, which were nice to watch, just for the fun of it.
 

 
It might attract ordinary kids who, because they admired Ye Xiaofan, want to live with him and see the big windmill every day. However, for Zhao Zai, there was no need for that. From the moment she woke up in the show, she instinctively went to take care of the weaker ones. Whenever others asked for her help or relied on her, as long as it was reasonable, she was willing to lend them a hand.
 

 
Meanwhile, Ye Xiaofan, who was dancing very energetically, was already sweating.
 

 
The fans and kids were enjoying it, and the fans thought he had seized the opportunity to appear on the show and proved that he was truly talented at dancing, not just someone who knew a little and used his love for street dance as a gimmick.
 

 
The two little kids, who were mesmerized, clapped for him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan turned around to look at Zhao Zai: "How was it, big brother... [sound muted]!"
 

 
Zhao Zai was wearing a pink little genius phone watch on her left wrist.
 

 
This was a symbol that the little guest had already found their parent.
 

 
Throughout the whole show, this phone watch could only connect to her parents and the host.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan shifted his gaze and indeed saw Jiang Dang, who was fiddling with a matching pink phone. The phone only had the most basic functions. Jiang Dang could certainly use it, but as he absentmindedly played with the phone, it seemed like he didn’t even know how to use it. Zhao Zai immediately leaned over to teach the big brother how to use the phone.
 

 
Special effects text displayed: "The smart AI has captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts..."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"The smart AI captured nothing!"
 

 
He was just zoning out while looking cool with his charming and aloof face.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to teach him, but Jiang Dang didn’t tell her that he actually knew how to use it, so he listened to her.
 

 
The audience knew he was listening.
 

 
Because when Zhao Zai spoke to him, the smart AI finally managed to capture his thoughts. He was silently repeating Zhao Zai’s words in his head, carefully taking in all the small phone tips that no adult would understand: [Press here to call her, the camera is over there, you can also set an alarm…]
 

 
[So many functions!]
 

 
The handsome guy had an epiphany.
 

 
[... What are you suddenly realizing?!]
 

 
The comments on the live stream were uncontrollable at this point.
 

 
The audience's mood resonated with Ye Xiaofan's incredulous expression.
 

 
After understanding the whole situation, Ye Xiaofan’s mentality collapsed even more: “Jiang Dang, I danced, okay? What about you? What did you do?”
 

 
“Hmm.”
 

 
Jiang Dang, who was directly called out, raised his eyes and looked at him sincerely.
 

 
That gaze was really quite sincere.
 

 
If his manager, who was watching the live stream, saw that look, they would’ve had a PTSD flashback right on the spot.
 

 
When Ye Xiaofan questioned him, Jiang Dang slowly clapped his hands and sincerely praised him: “You danced really well.”
 

 
?
 

 
Little friend, do you have many questions?
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought he was being mocked and was about to blow up right there. But Jiang Dang flipped over his phone and showed him the album: “I just took a really handsome one.”
 

 
In the album, there was Ye Xiaofan mid-Crazy Freeze.
 

 
The photo caught him with a cold expression doing a high-difficulty move, exuding a cool and charismatic aura—he really did look pretty handsome.
 

 
“Ah...”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan scratched his nose, looking like a big lion whose fur was stroked the right way: “Not bad, I guess. It’s pretty average, normal level.”
 

 
He completely forgot that he had come to question Jiang Dang because his turf was invaded, and that he had used his own phone to ask for this candid shot. Ye Xiaofan’s fans were torn between being heartbroken that their brother was so easy to fool and honestly following along to screenshot the perfect shot.
 

 
Jiang Dang taking a candid shot of Ye Xiaofan turned out to be another marketing talking point.
 

 
Moreover, the shot was flawless!
 

 
The audience looked at Jiang Dang with different eyes now.
 

 
Was he a white-cut-black type, or was this just a lucky mistake?
 

 
In any case, Ye Xiaofan, who had been shown up by his own handsomeness, felt embarrassed and didn’t press the matter further. Meanwhile, Long Fei, who saw Zhao Zai leaving with Jiang Dang, was a little troubled. But after thinking about it, she realized that she neither knew how to sing nor dance, and then she glanced at the face that had cooled her anger... She silently decided to let it go with a simple “forget it.”
 

 
Others were going their separate ways. Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai went to cultivate their relationship.
 

 
Long Fei and the ever-patient Xie Zihan took away Jia Jia.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had conquered Xiao Quan with his street dance, but unfortunately, the little boy wasn’t assertive enough. Ye Xiaofan, however, was more interested in the handsome Noah. Noah had been observing quietly, feeling quite ignored since the beginning. This time, being actively chosen, he didn’t put on airs and happily put on the gold-colored little genius watch.
 

 
In the end, Zhang Shi took over Xiao Quan.
 

 
The two of them standing together surprisingly gave off a somewhat cute father-son vibe.
 

 
Each “temporary family” is assigned a separate detached house, with each family living next to each other for seven days. During this period, there will be occasional activities and competitions. Before they separated, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia pulled Zhao Zai aside and whispered to her.
 

 
“I heard from Brother Fan that your parent isn’t reliable,”
 

 
Xiao Quan said in a low voice, “Why don’t you come live with me instead? My uncle is very reliable.”
 

 
Zhang Shi had a certain big brother aura about him.
 

 
Even though he hadn’t done anything, just looking at him gave people a sense of safety.
 

 
Jia Jia, in a hurry, interrupted: “Zhao Zai should live with me. I have two beautiful sisters at home!”
 

 
The instinctive variety show doesn’t mean that everyone just speaks their mind without restraint. It’s just a little more relaxed compared to reality. Ye Xiaofan, in most real-life situations, is someone who speaks his mind, so he was the one to openly express what the other guests thought of Jiang Dang— a genius songwriter with a mind that worked differently from others. Could he really take care of a child? Ye Xiaofan was skeptical.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans were quite nervous, worried that Jiang Dang's fans might get angry.
 

 
But then the fans wearing Jiang Dang’s fan badges were all agreeing:
 

 
[“You think my Brother Dang isn’t reliable? I’m fine with being called crazy.”]
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans: [……]
 

 
You could only say, fans follow their idol.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head, her voice soft but firm:
 

 
“I just met Brother Dang, and I don’t know what kind of adult he is, so…”
 

 
Jia Jia quickly interrupted her: “What if he doesn’t know how to bathe himself?”
 

 
Jiang Dang's fans: [……]
 

 
That was a bit too much.
 

 
In a child’s world, they’re willing to believe many strange guesses and don’t preemptively limit answers. Zhao Zai was a bit startled by this assumption—oh right, what if an adult who doesn’t even know how to use a phone (but he does) doesn’t know how to bathe himself? She didn’t learn to bathe on her own until after her fifth birthday. Her mother had installed a handrail in the bathroom at her height to prevent her from falling.
 

 
At first, her mother would sit next to her and watch her bathe. Later, when Zhao Zai got used to it, her mother would wait outside the bathroom door.
 

 
Zhao Zai firmly believed that, whether adults or children, there are tasks that must be solved on one’s own.
 

 
And she would never be defeated by difficulty.
 

 
No matter how tall the mountain standing in front of her, it would only ignite Zhao Zai’s fighting spirit!
 

 
Zhao Zai quietly clenched her fist and, with the resolve of Zheng Chenggong restoring the Ming Dynasty and Liu Bei reviving the Han Empire, said resolutely: “If he doesn’t know how to bathe, I’ll teach him. I’ll teach him until he knows how. Since he’s an adult, he should learn faster than me. I took three days to learn how to bathe myself. I’ll teach Brother Dang to bathe on his own within two days!”
 

 
What a heroic spirit.
 

 
The two little children and the audience in the live stream were deeply shocked.
 

 
“Alright then,” Jia Jia said, reluctantly tugging at her hand. “If you really can’t teach him, you have to tell us, so that Sister Fei and Sister Zi Han can teach him together.”
 

 
“And me, and me!”
 

 
The children got a bit distracted as they chatted.
 

 
Even someone as clever as Zhao Zai forgot that “Jiang Dang can’t bathe by himself” was just an extreme scenario suggested by another child, with no real evidence to back it up.
 

 
...
 

 
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Zhao Zai had somehow taken on the invisible task of “teaching Jiang Dang to bathe alone.”
 

 
And Jiang Dang didn’t know that, in the minds of the three little ones, he now bore the responsibility of “learning to bathe.”
 

 
For a moment, the audience couldn’t even tell who was worse off.
 

 
To put the younger ones at ease, Zhao Zai was the last to leave.
 

 
She sent them off one by one. Although each child looked back three times as they walked, their steps were light, bouncing and full of energy.
 

 
After sending them off, Zhao Zai visibly relaxed, and gracefully walked over to where Jiang Dang was sitting in the corner, playing on his phone. He had been waiting for her, not rushing or asking when she was going to leave. When she walked over, he immediately put his phone back in his pocket, curling his lips into a smile. “Ready to go home?”
 

 
“Mhm, let’s go.”
 

 
Zhao Zai naturally extended her hand, letting Jiang Dang hold it.
 

 
It didn’t feel like a guardian taking care of a child; it felt more like adopting a lazy big cat.
 

 
“Do you want me to hold your hand?” Jiang Dang asked.
 

 
“Mhm, otherwise I might get lost. I asked the host for a map earlier. It’ll take about three minutes to walk home from here.”
 

 
Look at this child, so sensible.
 

 
Some audience members who couldn’t read maps were already wondering how a child like this would even come into being, so practical!
 

 
At this moment, the program team pulled up the content Jiang Dang had been looking at on his phone earlier—
 

 
He had been checking the map of the park.
 

 
He knew exactly how to get there.
 

 
But Jiang Dang didn’t say anything. When he heard Zhao Zai was going to guide him, he smiled again. “You just need to show me the way.”
 

 
He bent down and gently picked her up, holding her in his arms.
 

 
He was very careful, making sure her delicate little dress wouldn’t show anything.
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively hugged his neck.
 

 
“I can walk by myself,” she said.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “You just focus on showing me the way.”
 

 
Soon, Zhao Zai experienced the joy of being carried. She swung her little legs gently, focusing all her attention on guiding Brother Dang, afraid he might get lost. Jiang Dang knew exactly which way to take at every fork, but still chose to listen to her.
 

 
During this time, Zhao Zai had forgotten part of the way, but Jiang Dang didn’t point it out. Instead, he followed the parts she could remember, and together they slowly found the villa arranged by the host. By then, they were a little later than the other temporary families.
 

 
“Sorry, I remembered the way wrong earlier,” Zhao Zai whispered.
 

 
“You’re tired. It’s normal to make mistakes when you’re tired,” Jiang Dang said, reaching out to gently pat the back of her head. His fingers, usually used for playing guitar and piano, threaded through her soft hair and pressed lightly on her little head. The sensation was soothing and comforting, almost tickling. “Even when I’m not tired, I still make mistakes often.”
 

 
“Is that so…”
 

 
Zhao Zai blinked her eyes.
 

 
After he said that and patted her, her eyelids suddenly grew heavy. Her limbs felt like they were filled with lead. She changed to a more comfortable position, resting her head on his neck. She hadn’t slept well in the afternoon due to the disturbances, and when she saw the other children looking scared and unsettled, she forced herself to stay alert, putting on a bright and strong face in front of others.
 

 
She asked them if they were scared.
 

 
No one asked her if she was tired or wanted to sleep.
 

 
So what if she was tired?
 

 
Zhao Zai still felt she shouldn’t make mistakes. Her stubbornness kicked in, and she mumbled in Jiang Dang’s ear, “I won’t make mistakes again next time, I’m sorry…”
 

 
“If you live with me, I’ll make mistakes often. We’ll balance each other out, and you can consider this as prepaying for one chance to forgive me.”
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand those eight words.
 

 
Her small head grew even heavier, and Jiang Dang patted her back, making her lie more comfortably on the bed.
 

 
Jiang Dang held the little girl with one arm and used the other to open the villa’s door by inputting the code. He hesitated for a moment at the light switch, but then chose to stand still in the entrance for a while, letting their eyes adjust to the darkness before walking further in. Once he found the children’s room, he placed Zhao Zai on the bed, helping her sit up, even though she was already half-asleep.
 

 
Zhao Zai could hardly keep her eyes open. Without thinking, she reached out for the pillow she had been resting on earlier, which led to her grabbing Jiang Dang’s head instead.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head, about to lie down, but Jiang Dang quickly caught her. “At least take off your shoes before sleeping.”
 

 
He kept the position with her holding his head and awkwardly took off her glossy little leather shoes and white socks. Afterward, he thought for a moment, stuffed the socks into the shoes, and placed them by the bed. Then, he managed to free his head from her grasp and laid her flat in the bed, covering her with the blanket tightly.
 

 
He placed a cup of warm water on the bedside table.
 

 
This time, no one would wake her up while she was sleeping.
 

 
It had been a long time since the broadcast started. Some audience members who were just watching for the novelty had already left, waiting for the edited version. Only those who treated this variety show as a form of companionship remained, and when they saw this scene, they were amazed by Jiang Dang’s thoughtfulness.
 

 
Oh, and his manager was watching, too.
 

 
The manager was once again wondering if this guy was intentionally performing for him.
 

 
…
 

 
Zhao Zai woke up in the middle of the night, having fallen asleep too early. The cup of fruit-flavored water she had brought earlier came in handy. She opened the lid and drank slowly, soothing her throat and clearing her mind. Her memories from before bed began to return. In a panic, she jumped out of bed, found her slippers, and made her way to the master bedroom in the dark.
 

 
Jiang Dang had light sleep, and he noticed as soon as a little creature crawled into the bed.
 

 
He opened his eyes.
 

 
What met his gaze was a pair of bright, sparkling eyes.
 

 
“You’re awake?” Jiang Dang asked, showing no intention of getting up.
 

 
His voice was groggy from just waking up, with a hoarse edge to it. His eyes were half-closed, and he reached out to pat her head. His hand felt soft, like a plush toy cat, but his hair was a bit messy from sleep. Without realizing it, he started using his fingers to gently comb through the little girl’s hair.
 

 
“Yeah, I’m awake,”
 

 
Zhao Zai said, lying at the edge of the bed. “Brother Dong, did you take a shower before you went to bed? Do you want me to teach you how to take a shower?”
 

 
…
 

 
It could be called the "Confusing Children’s Statement Award" live.
 

 
“No need, I took a shower before bed.”
 

 
“Can you shower by yourself?”
 

 
Zhao Zai was cautious.
 

 
Adults can lie.
 

 
And they’re often better at it than kids, something she had plenty of experience with.
 

 
“I can,” Jiang Dang said, thinking for a moment. “Can’t you?”
 

 
Even if she couldn’t, he couldn’t shower her, it wouldn’t be appropriate.
 

 
He then looked at a doll in the corner, about the same height as Zhao Zai, and said softly, “If you can’t, I can use that teddy bear to show you how to shower.”
 

 
The teddy bear doll, which wasn’t waterproof, had a large question mark on its head.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head. “I can shower, I’m just worried about you~”
 

 
“Worried about me…”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled. “I’m fine. If you can sleep again, go ahead and sleep. If you’re hungry, I’ll get up and make you something to eat.”
 

 
Zhao Zai said she wasn’t hungry.
 

 
Just as she finished speaking, her stomach let out a loud growl.
 

 
Physiological hunger doesn’t listen to one’s will. Even though Zhao Zai felt it wasn’t quite right to wake up an adult in the middle of the night to make food for her, as it didn’t seem like something a good child would do… her stomach still growled. Zhao Zai quickly covered her stomach, trying to act casual, and was about to turn around and sneak away, pretending nothing happened, when Jiang Dang, who had turned over and sat up, caught her by the back of her neck.
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head up.
 

 
"Go brush your teeth and wash your face, dinner is ready."
 

 
Jiang Dang's voice, still carrying the grogginess of just waking up, was firm and left no room for argument. His slightly grumpy, just-woke-up demeanor only added to the intimidating aura of his villainous face. Zhao Zai weighed the pros and cons and decided it was better to listen to the adult. She obediently went to the bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face. Remembering she hadn’t showered before bed, she called out to Jiang Dang, saying she was going to take a shower. After receiving a simple "Okay," she quickly completed the entire routine.
 

 
After drying her body and wet hair with a large white towel, Zhao Zai put on a brand new set of pajamas and grabbed the railing to look downstairs.
 

 
The kitchen downstairs was lit, with wisps of white steam drifting out.
 

 
The glass door was fogged up, only faintly outlining the figure of a man.
 

 
As if sensing her gaze, Jiang Dang took two steps back and looked up at her.
 

 
"Come downstairs and have some noodles."
# Chapter122
Zhao Zai originally intended to help.
 

 
Although there were servants to handle chores at home, with only her and Brother Dang here, she believed that everyone who ate should contribute. However, when her short legs carried her over to the stove, Jiang Dang gently pressed down on her head.
 

 
"Go sit down."
 

 
"I can help bring the bowls and chopsticks out," Zhao Zai replied seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, "Are you going to walk over, or should I carry you?"
 

 
Zhao Zai stubbornly locked eyes with him for a moment.
 

 
In the end, Jiang Dang handed her a pair of chopsticks and let her take them out.
 

 
The noodles in the small pot were soon cooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked if there was anything she didn’t eat. Zhao Zai shook her head. "I’m not picky~"
 

 
That made things easier.
 

 
After Zhao Zai sat down, she turned her head toward the kitchen.
 

 
The rhythmic sound of chopping filled the air as Jiang Dang sliced scallions into segments and sprinkled them into a bowl. Boiling soup poured over the scallions, cooking them instantly. Their fresh green and white hues glistened, giving the dish an appetizing appearance.
 

 
He placed the bowl in front of Zhao Zai.
 

 
There was only one bowl.
 

 
"Aren’t you eating, Brother Dang?" Zhao Zai asked, holding her chopsticks hesitantly.
 

 
The aroma of the broth wafted up with the steam, whetting her appetite. Although she had only been slightly hungry before, the smell pushed her hunger to a new level. After Jiang Dang reassured her that he wasn’t eating, she couldn't resist breaking the half-cooked egg on top of the soup. The golden yolk oozed out like molten lava, coating the noodles. She picked up a large bite of noodles drenched in yolk and slurped them up, savoring the rich, delicious flavor.
 

 
It was hard to eat noodles without making noise.
 

 
Even though Zhao Zai was extremely hungry, she still managed to restrain herself from devouring the food, not opening up her stomach to eat greedily. She ate quietly in the long night, feeling a warmth spread through her hands and feet as she was satisfied. Just as she was immersed in the delicious food, her little head was gently pressed from behind.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused.
 

 
"Keep eating, I'll do my thing."
 

 
She heard Brother Dang’s voice from behind her.
 

 
Jiang Dang was holding a hairdryer. Zhao Zai’s hair, soft and thick like cat fur, couldn’t handle the full force of the blow, so he set the dryer on a low setting to avoid blowing her head off. The warm, yellow light in the dining room bathed his hands—hands that were elegant and graceful, capable of creating many heartfelt songs, and now, they were simply brushing her hair.
 

 
The scene was warm and heartwarming.
 

 
The intelligent AI tried to read Jiang Dang's subconscious, attempting to capture some human-like thoughts to elevate the moment.
 

 
"AI captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts…"
 

 
"Captured!"
 

 
Finally, the guy was actually thinking about something.
 

 
The assistant director on night shift was moved to tears.
 

 
Jiang Dang:
 

 
"Which came first, the egg or the chicken?"
 

 
"When is the best time to break the egg yolk in a fried egg?"
 

 
…
 

 
Night shift staff: "..."
 

 
When Jiang Dang thinks, even God is speechless.
 

 
By the time Zhao Zai finished her bowl of noodles, her hair was almost dry. Her long, glossy hair was neatly combed, and the stray strands were tucked behind her small ears, shaped like seashells.
 

 
Jiang Dang gently pinched her ear. "It’s dry now."
 

 
"Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
Zhao Zai picked up her bowl and walked to the kitchen sink, willingly starting to wash the dishes. She had almost no experience with housework, but this task didn’t need any special training—it just depended on how serious one was. She held the sponge with her small hands, scrubbing vigorously, cleaning every spot, even the little grooves at the bottom of the bowl. She only placed it in the sterilizing cabinet after it was thoroughly cleaned.
 

 
Zhao Zai wiped her hands dry.
 

 
Still not feeling sleepy after eating, Zhao Zai thought for a moment and then walked over to ask the elder: "Brother Dang, can I walk around the yard for a bit? My stomach feels a bit too full~"
 

 
"I’ll go with you."
 

 
Jiang Dang took her hand, which was still cold from washing the dishes, and wrapped his large hand around her small, pale hand, warming it for a moment. "Your hands are so cold."
 

 
Her fingertips, which had turned slightly red from the water, were gradually warmed up.
 

 
"I’m a little jealous."
 

 
"Jealous of what?" Zhao Zai asked, puzzled.
 

 
"If my hands were as cold as yours," Jiang Dang mused as he stared at her little face, "I could freeze your face."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Zhao Zai immediately became alert.
 

 
Unfortunately, after just cooking the noodles and drying the little one's hair with the blow dryer, Jiang Dang’s hands were warm, and he didn’t have the chance to freeze her. Instead, he held her hand and walked with her in the yard, with her in front and him following behind.
 

 
Under the moonlit night, everything was silent.
 

 
This didn’t seem like the time for a child to be awake and out, but Zhao Zai inexplicably felt a bit excited. Her little face was warm, and she felt like she could take on ten people. Her steps quickened, as if she were a little dog frolicking around.
 

 
Jiang Dang watched her small back, thinking to himself:
 

 
"Such a small one..."
 

 
"If I kicked her, she'd probably fly far."
 

 
…
 

 
Night-shift assistant director: "Is this content fit to be broadcast?"
 

 
"Ah," said the staff, "it seems like his agent has already given up on managing him."
 

 
There's no saving him now, just let him be.
 

 
Zhao Zai was hopping around joyfully, but the night road was unpredictable. In a moment of over-excitement, she nearly tripped and fell. However, Jiang Dang, quick on his feet, caught her in the middle of the fall, lifting her up like a little chick. Suspended in the air, Zhao Zai kicked her legs a little, hanging from his strong arm, her face trying hard to appear calm after being startled: "Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
She really tried hard to appear composed.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at her.
 

 
Just as the night-shift assistant director thought Jiang Dang might comfort the little girl, Jiang Dang said something completely random:
 

 
"You..."
 

 
"You kind of look like a weeble."
 

 
?
 

 
Zhao Zai’s small head was full of confusion.
 

 
What nonsense is this grown-up talking?
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped down from his arm.
 

 
After walking off the meal, she held Jiang Dang’s hand and headed back to the villa. She brushed her teeth and washed her face on her own. Before going to bed, she thanked her guardian:
 

 
"Thank you for making me supper."
 

 
It was really delicious.
 

 
Zhao Zai licked her lips in her mind.
 

 
"Mm, due to time constraints, otherwise I could’ve made it better," Jiang Dang said, sounding a bit regretful. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the chance to prepare his specialty molecular gastronomy dish—molecular cuisine usually takes a lot of time to prepare. Seeing that the little one was so hungry earlier, he had to settle for a simple dish instead, one that didn’t show off his culinary skills at all. "Sorry for making you eat this."
 

 
"No need to apologize, you can make it again next time~"
 

 
Unaware that she had narrowly avoided trouble, Zhao Zai tugged at Jiang Dang’s finger.
 

 
"Do you want me to tell you a bedtime story?"
 

 
Perhaps it was the warm soup noodles and the timely hug that helped Zhao Zai lower her guard. She blinked her eyes, tucked the blanket corner, and quietly said the truth: "I want to hear one.”
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
...
 

 
The night-shift assistant director suddenly became energized.
 

 
This was Jiang Dang’s bedtime story!
 

 
If turned into an audio recording, it would definitely be a popular selling point.
 

 
Just imagine, that low, gentle voice, softly narrating a hypnotic story in the quiet night, surely making one feel safe and drift off to sleep...
 

 
Jiang Dang sat by the bed. The small nightlight illuminated his side profile, making his already deep features appear even more striking and handsome. The shadow cast across the other side of his face looked like a dark mask, adding a sinister charm to his beauty.
 

 
Not only could he sing, but his voice also had a slight radio-like quality, captivating and smooth, weaving a story as if calling from some ancient source:
 

 
“Perhaps you’ve heard of Cthulhu?”
 

 
Zhao Zai: "I haven't."
 

 
The night-shift assistant director was stunned.
 

 
"It’s the ancient ruler, an indescribable terror…”
 

 
His voice was low and smooth, almost seductive.
 

 
When Jiang Dang told stories, the imagery and emotional depth were so powerful that Zhao Zai clutched the blanket and shivered. But she was also indeed tired, and despite her unease, she soon drifted into an anxious sleep…
 

 
In her dream, there was a giant octopus and countless eyes. She didn’t dare to look at anything.
 

 
Because gazing into Cthulhu’s eyes would drive one mad.
 

 
Zhao Zai’s face, pressed against the pillow while lying on her side, looked like a little rice cake. She was unsure of what she dreamed about, but her eyelashes and lips trembled slightly. Jiang Dang saw that she had fallen asleep and felt proud of how well he had taken care of her.
 

 
Sigh, maybe he had a talent for being a babysitter.
 

 
Meanwhile, the night-shift staff unanimously agreed that he must belong to some evil cult.
 

 
The next morning, Zhao Zai woke up early and, after quickly brushing her teeth and washing her face, sneakily made her way to Jiang Dang’s room to quietly sit and wait for him to wake up. She was alone in the children's room, always feeling as though mysterious eyes were watching her. But she didn’t dare to investigate, because in Brother Dang’s story, everyone who sought out that mysterious force was eventually driven mad by its terrifying power.
 

 
When Jiang Dang opened his eyes, he saw a neatly dressed little girl sitting up straight on the couch beside the bed.
 

 
She looked like a porcelain doll from a dollhouse.
 

 
"Up so early?"
 

 
Jiang Dang’s handsome face broke into a smile he thought was friendly. "Did you want to hear the continuation of last night’s story?"
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head rapidly, like a rattle.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team never expected that Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai’s pairing would go so smoothly.
 

 
They had originally thought there would be trouble on the first night.
 

 
But it turned out Jiang Dang was quite good at taking care of children.
 

 
Telling a kid a terrifying story about Cthulhu as a bedtime fairytale is a bit inhumane.
 

 
What about the other groups?
 

 
Zhang Shi and Xiao Quan spent a perfectly calm night.
 

 
Long Fei had no patience for taking care of children, so it was almost always Xie Zihan who was busy running around. When it came time for the bedtime story, Xie Zihan told Jia Jia the story of ‘Cinderella’, while Long Fei commented, "Of course, when there's a stepmother, there will be a stepfather too. Men can't be trusted."
 

 
"Men can't be trusted!" Jia Jia repeated, mimicking her.
 

 
Xie Zihan was a bit flustered: "Sister Fei, it's not good to say that in front of the kids..."
 

 
"What's wrong with that? They’ll need to know sooner or later. Men can’t be trusted!"
 

 
Jia Jia was curious: "So what can we trust?"
 

 
"Trust others, you’re a princess. Trust yourself, and you’re a queen."
 

 
...
 

 
The most chaotic group was Ye Xiaofan and Noah.
 

 
Noah was used to being a pampered young master, always having others take care of him, and Ye Xiaofan wasn’t much better. At school, he either ordered takeout or ate at the cafeteria and had never cooked before. The two of them arrived early at the villa, and after staring at each other for a while, Noah declared he was hungry.
 

 
After some thought, Ye Xiaofan found two bowls of instant noodles in the kitchen.
 

 
Noah turned his head and said he didn’t want that.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan: "Then what do you want to eat?"
 

 
Noah glanced at the kitchen, which was stocked with ingredients: "I want to eat a proper meal."
 

 
This seemed like a reasonable request.
 

 
Thinking she was here for a variety show and couldn’t look too incompetent, Ye Xiaofan reluctantly Googled some recipes while trying to make a dinner that was mediocre in taste, appearance, and smell. He didn’t like it himself, but at least it was homemade. After tasting a bite, it was passable—not undercooked, just a bit salty.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan called him to wash his hands and eat, but Noah sat in the corner without saying a word.
 

 
He glanced at the food: "I’m not eating this."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan picked up two pieces of stir-fried meat in front of him and ate them: "It’s not bad, though it’s not great either."
 

 
Noah put on a stern face, didn’t stay in the living room, and went straight to the game room to play with toys.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan watched his back and raised his voice: "Aren’t you eating?"
 

 
Noah muttered, "I’m not hungry, I’m not eating!"
 

 
After saying that, Noah distractedly played with his toys, waiting for the adults to bring a bowl and coax him to eat. This was his usual eating routine at home—if someone coaxed him, he could force himself to eat a little.
 

 
But after waiting and waiting, all he heard was Ye Xiaofan enjoying his meal in the living room, followed by the sound of him cleaning up the dishes.
 

 
Noah peeked his head out and looked around.
 

 
Where were the traces of the meal in the living room? There was only an instant noodle bowl. Ye Xiaofan had been too lazy to clean up, maybe thinking he’d want some later. The bowls were ceramic, and he didn’t want Noah to break them and hurt himself—Ye Xiaofan was a normal adult, so he considered safety, but coaxing someone to eat? That never crossed his mind.
 

 
After realizing that Ye Xiaofan had no intention of coaxing him, Noah suddenly lost interest in the toy in his hands.
 

 
In frustration, he threw the toy against the wall and sulked, thinking:
 

 
"I don’t care."
 

 
"I’m not hungry anyway. Those dishes looked disgusting."
 

 
Since it was the first day, the production team didn’t assign any interaction tasks to the guests. The idea was to allow the guests, both big and small, to relax and bond without the pressure of tasks. Seeing there were no tasks, Ye Xiaofan decided to spend his time looking for video game consoles in the villa. Sure enough, he found a Switch, a Wii, and a PS5, among others. He did ask Noah if he wanted to play, but Noah, crossing his arms, snorted, "They're all games I’m tired of playing."
 

 
Well then, I’ll just play by myself.
 

 
So, Ye Xiaofan played happily, feeling at ease.
 

 
However, Noah, who had been in a good mood at first, started getting angrier as the night went on.
 

 
"This adult won't even make me eat, and doesn’t care about my game time. He’s so bad!"
 

 
By the next day, Noah asked the host if he could switch parents!
 

 
The host was in a difficult position, as there was no precedent for this.
 

 
The other two kids, upon hearing this, were also reluctant. After all, they had finally gotten comfortable with their own parents. Though Xiao Quan liked the way Brother Fan danced, he had started to rely on Uncle Zhang Shi.
 

 
Seeing that no one else wanted to, Noah’s mood seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.
 

 
He pressed his lips tightly together, looking as though he was about to cry.
 

 
The production team quickly came up with a temporary solution: they would pair Noah and Xiao Zhao together and have them be in one family unit.
 

 
After all, based on Jiang Dang's performance on the first night, he seemed to know how to cook.
 

 
The host asked, “Is that okay?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao didn’t have the same resistance to Noah as the other kids. She looked at Noah, who was clearly on the verge of tears, and agreed. When it came to Jiang Dang, the host gave him a frantic look, fearing he might refuse.
 

 
If he refused, Noah's pride would really shatter.
 

 
The agent, watching this scene unfold on the live broadcast after waking up, couldn’t help but sigh, realizing the host still didn’t fully understand Jiang Dang.
 

 
Sure enough, when Jiang Dang saw the host’s signals, he looked confused. “You…”
 

 
The host responded, “Hmm?”
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, “Is your eye bothering you?”
 

 
The agent just wanted to say—
 

 
It’s a basic move, don’t laugh.
 

 
Fortunately, after understanding the host’s intentions, Jiang Dang not only agreed but did so enthusiastically. He looked at Noah with admiration: "Perfect, I was just thinking of making a nice lunch, and it’s such a waste for only one person to hear last night’s story. You’ve come at just the right time."
 

 
Upon hearing "last night’s story," the usually composed Xiao Zhao couldn’t help but nervously glance at Brother Dang:
 

 
"Actually, Brother Ye Xiaofan is really nice, why don’t you…"
 

 
"I want him!" Noah immediately cut in.
 

 
Hearing that Xiao Zhao seemed reluctant for Jiang Dang to take him, and following the principle of "what the enemy rejects is what I’ll fight for," Noah quickly stepped forward with his demand and looked at Xiao Zhao with a victorious gaze, ignoring her implied warning to "run away.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao was speechless: "Fine."
 

 
Brother Dang's cooking is delicious, and it should be enough to make up for the psychological trauma caused by the stories he told.
 

 
Noah, the young master, was full of confidence and kept pressing on:
 

 
"I didn’t eat last night, and now I’m so hungry! I want him to only cook for me. You can eat the food that guy made. Once you’ve eaten it, you’ll understand why I won’t eat his cooking."
 

 
It was getting close to noon, and the live broadcast of the variety show was slowly attracting viewers.
 

 
[This little brat’s looks are proportional to how annoying he is.]
 

 
[He’s obviously been spoiled.]
 

 
[Why is he bullying Xiao Zhao? Xiao Zhao, beat him up! Jiang Dang couldn’t even beat Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
...
 

 
What the audience hoped to see—Xiao Zhao pinning the young master to the ground and beating him up—was obviously not going to happen at this stage.
 

 
Before facing major changes, Xiao Zhao was a well-mannered young lady who set high standards for herself. She tolerated Noah’s behavior with a glance, ready to argue with him, but when she saw Ye Xiaofan’s frustrated expression, she chose to take care of the other adult’s pride instead. "You want to eat the food Brother Dang made, right?"
 

 
"Mm-hmm."
 

 
"Then I also want to eat the food Brother Ye made."
 

 
Xiao Zhao gave Jiang Dang a look to show she wasn’t rejecting him; it was just a temporary measure. Then she walked over to Ye Xiaofan, tugging at his sleeve to show encouragement. Ye Xiaofan felt both frustrated and hurt—didn’t he enjoy eating instant noodles? If it weren’t for taking care of this little brat, would he really need to spend time searching on Baidu and slaving away in the kitchen?
 

 
Looking down, he saw the clear, almost translucent deer-like eyes of the little girl, and his heart melted.
 

 
"Okay, okay, I’ll make whatever you want to eat!"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan squatted down and hugged the little angel.
 

 
Xiao Zhao hadn’t expected this, and her face showed an almost breathless expression. She forced herself to pat his head. "Good..."
 

 
Sigh, adults are really hard to take care of!
 

 
Seeing everything under his control, Noah raised his chin with a victorious smile.
 

 
This was the situation he was most familiar with.
 

 
All the adults were revolving around him, catering to his needs, focusing on him, and treating him like the center of attention.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at him and asked:
 

 
"So, are you going to finish the food I make for you?"
 

 
Feeling victorious, Noah was in a great mood and patted his chest, promising:
 

 
"I’ve been starving all night; I can eat a whole cow now! As long as it’s not the food he made, I’ll finish it all! If I don’t, I’m a dog!"
 

 
To let the guests show off their cooking skills, the villa was stocked with plenty of ingredients.
 

 
Even the more difficult-to-find ingredients could be delivered by the host within five minutes—after all, it was just the program team adjusting the data, and the ingredient codes were very cheap.
 

 
But the four sardines, eel, nutmeg, pig’s blood, chocolate, and bananas Jiang Dang requested…
 

 
What exactly was he planning to cook?
 

 
Watching Jiang Dang preparing to serve this bratty little young master, Ye Xiaofan’s initial hostility toward him not only dissipated but even gave way to a sense of shared camaraderie. “I didn’t expect you to look so unreliable, yet you actually know how to cook?”
 

 
“Basic survival skills for studying abroad,” Jiang Dang replied.
 

 
Wearing an apron, he exuded a homely vibe. The steam rising from the pot softened his silhouette, adding an air of reliability.
 

 
“I studied in the UK for a while.”
# Chapter123
“How long is this going to take?”
 

 
Noah, who hadn’t eaten dinner last night, was so hungry that his stomach was pressing against his back. Though Ye Xiaofan had made a quick breakfast this morning, Noah still held a grudge against him for not inviting him to play the game (he’d only invited him once). He thought to himself that unless Ye Xiaofan begged him, he wouldn’t eat a single bite...
 

 
In the end, he really didn’t get any food.
 

 
“Man dies for money, child dies for food,” Noah decided to lower his proud head just a little. It was impossible for him to bow down to Ye Xiaofan, who he held a grudge against, but he could at least show some favor to Jiang Dang, whom he’d stolen from Tong Zhao. Even if he didn’t ask, he’d still obediently eat the food this time.
 

 
There was no choice, he was too hungry.
 

 
Noah wandered around the kitchen, the smell of food drifting to his nose, stirring the hunger inside him. His stomach growled, and he couldn’t hold back any longer. He reluctantly went over to Jiang Dang to hurry him up.
 

 
“I need some time to cook,” Jiang Dang said without being moved. “If you can’t wait, you can eat what Ye Xiaofan made.”
 

 
“I’m not eating what he made.”
 

 
Noah snorted coldly.
 

 
Though he snorted, upon hearing Jiang Dang say that, Noah still held back and sat at the dining table, playing with his phone and waiting. Every now and then, he would glance toward the kitchen, but all he could see was the rising steam.
 

 
At that moment, what kept him going wasn’t just his pride.
 

 
It was also Jiang Dang’s cooking skills.
 

 
Noah had observed Ye Xiaofan cooking last night.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was squinting at the recipe on his phone while stirring the food, his brows furrowed. He looked at the dish like it was an enemy. When adding the seasoning, he hesitated. Could something good come out of this? Noah wasn’t holding out any hope. It looked like slop, and even though Ye Xiaofan was eating it happily, Noah only thought that he’d never had anything better.
 

 
But then he looked at Jiang Dang.
 

 
After putting on an apron, Jiang Dang looked like one of those skilled men on Douyin, confidently and gracefully cooking. His movements were smooth and practiced, showing that he was a seasoned cook. He knew exactly how much seasoning to use, never foolishly measuring salt with a cup. And as for the dish...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan’s was just home cooking.
 

 
Tomato scrambled eggs, stir-fried green peppers with shredded pork—Noah was sick of that.
 

 
But when he looked at Jiang Dang, he saw him flattening a dough disc and placing it into a container, shaping it into a pie crust.
 

 
Though he didn’t know exactly what Jiang Dang was making, it clearly looked very fancy.
 

 
It was food Noah had never seen before.
 

 
Looking at the ingredients, there was also chocolate and bananas.
 

 
Noah liked both of those, and then there was eel. He was craving Japanese grilled eel rice, just thinking about it made him hungry.
 

 
Noah kicked his legs, glancing over at Tong Zhao beside him.
 

 
She wasn’t on her phone, holding a notebook and doing homework. This was something she had asked the host for—she was worried about falling behind in her studies, but she wouldn’t let it interfere with the show or playing games. She would study during breaks.
 

 
Listen, is that even something a child would say?
 

 
Noah found it hard to believe.
 

 
His own parents had also wanted him to bring his homework, saying that subconsciously he should maintain a competitive spirit, but unfortunately, the little master had torn up his homework on the spot, saying he wouldn’t do it. Noah sneaked a glance at the problems Tong Zhao was working on...
 

 
Shit.
 

 
He couldn’t understand it.
 

 
Noah was secretly angry:
 

 
“You think doing this will make the adults think you’re obedient and like you more?”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him: “Are you talking to me?”
 

 
“Well, who else?”
 

 
“How strange,” Tong Zhao said in confusion, “Even if I don’t do my homework, the adults still like me a lot.”
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao was so cute and confident!
 

 
The comments flooded with laughter, especially from Tong Zhao’s fans, who kept agreeing, saying that no matter what Tong Zhao did or didn’t do, Mommy and Daddy always loved her the most. While Noah was still stunned, Ye Xiaofan came out with a big smile, holding two dishes: “Dinner’s ready. Do you want to finish your homework first?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head, jumping off her chair: “I’ll go serve the food for Brother Ye, wait for me, Brother~”
 

 
...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, who had been ignored all day by Noah the day before and criticized by the brat in the morning, was now warmed to the core. AI detected his current feelings—
 

 
"So kids can be this cute too, I take back everything I said about human children being little terrors. I will always love Tong Zhao! Ah, her little voice calling me ‘brother’ is so sweet, sob, I really want a little sister. I should’ve let my mom have a second child last time..."
 

 
At this moment, Ye Xiaofan glanced at Noah sitting next to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"...Never mind, what if she has a little brother instead? The risk is too great."
 

 
"Can I take Tong Zhao home after the show?"
 

 
His heartfelt words about only wanting a little sister and not a little brother made the audience laugh.
 

 
Normally, words like this would spark rumors.
 

 
But this is little Tong Zhao, who is miles away from the idea of early romance. Even the fans who adore Ye Xiaofan and consider him the perfect boyfriend wouldn't be jealous of a little loli. Besides, when their older brother was ignored by Noah and bullied by the brat, they all suppressed their anger, feeling sorry for their brother. Now, seeing him so healed and acting like a silly big brother, they even felt grateful to Tong Zhao.
 

 
If it weren’t for Tong Zhao, Ye Xiaofan would have been bullied by the brat to the point of questioning his life.
 

 
After all, the production team hadn’t tried to pair up Tong Zhao with any other male guests in a romantic way. The fans could sense the direction of the show and had accepted the sibling dynamic for the two of them.
 

 
A sweet and obedient little sister was simply impossible to feel resentful toward.
 

 
However…
 

 
[? You can't just take Tong Zhao away, she belongs to everyone!]
 

 
[Want to take away my cloud-raised little one?? There’s something seriously wrong with you!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is bearing a workload of homework that she shouldn’t even have to deal with at her age. By the way, do kids like this who voluntarily do their homework even exist in real life?]
 

 
Tong Zhao seriously served up two bowls of rice.
 

 
One bowl was a little more full, piled into a nice-looking pyramid shape, and the other was slightly less, about two-thirds full. Ye Xiaofan watched her work with her short legs, moving back and forth like a little Q-version character in a mobile game. His internal balance between “helping her” and “watching her a little longer” swung back and forth, with both choices feeling equally attractive.
 

 
Although her legs were short, Tong Zhao worked quickly and efficiently. She placed the fuller bowl in front of Ye Xiaofan: “I’m done, Brother Ye, eat.”
 

 
“Alright, thank you.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan took the bowl, which was warm to the touch.
 

 
But it wasn’t just rice in that bowl—
 

 
It was the love of his little sister for him!
 

 
This time, in order to impress his little sister, Ye Xiaofan worked extra hard. Compared to yesterday, he had made some progress. The food smelled rich and savory, the twice-cooked pork stir-fried to the perfect color, and the half-fat, half-lean pork gleaming with enticing oil. What touched the audience the most, however, was the small bowl of stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers placed in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This small bowl in front of Tong Zhao had only the shredded pork, no green peppers.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had picked out the peppers just for her while cooking in the kitchen.
 

 
[Ye Xiaofan looks like the most rebellious and arrogant young man in the world, but who knew he could be so thoughtful and warm?]
 

 
[He says he wants a sister like Tong Zhao, but honestly, I wish I had a brother like him!]
 

 
[This is so sweet, and the food looks pretty good too. It's not as bad as the brat says!]
 

 
The two of them chatted and laughed while eating, and the atmosphere was fantastic.
 

 
At the same table, Noah sat there sulking. Every breath he took only made the tempting smell of meat stronger, and his phone had lost its appeal. Even though he was looking through the lens of disdain for Ye Xiaofan, the aroma was still incredibly enticing. He almost wanted to stop breathing, but he also felt that getting up and leaving the table would make him seem weak.
 

 
[I don’t want to eat at all!]
 

 
[Why is Jiang Dang not done yet…]
 

 
[I’m so hungry, why isn’t anyone asking if I want to eat…]
 

 
With a stomach full of grievances, Noah lowered his head, his eyes red and his nose tip tingling, looking like he was about to cry.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan ate heartily, clearly enjoying his meal.
 

 
He felt that all the emotional damage he had suffered from the brat was completely healed by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Plus, he was indeed hungry, so he ate quickly, not even thinking of leaving any food for Noah. After all, Noah said he didn’t want to eat, and Ye Xiaofan felt that he was respecting the kid's wishes, never forcing him to eat – he remembered when he was young, there were times when he felt bad and didn’t want to eat, and his parents would just leave him alone to calm down.
 

 
Just as Noah was on the verge of tears, Jiang Dang’s cool, soft voice, like a heavenly melody, came from the kitchen:
 

 
“It's done. Go serve yourself.”
 

 
“Don’t take too much, one serving is the main dish. The rice is for mixing with the eel jelly.”
 

 
As soon as he heard this, Noah couldn’t hold his pride any longer. He obediently went to serve himself two bowls of rice.
 

 
When he returned with the rice, the dishes Jiang Dang had made were already on the table.
 

 
Noah froze.
 

 
The audience froze too.
 

 
Most of the audience had been thoroughly entertained by Ye Xiaofan and Tong Zhao’s interactions earlier. Jiang Dang’s cooking process had been long and drawn out, and except for his fans, most viewers hadn’t paid much attention to it. But now, when the food was served, it exceeded their expectations—
 

 
A pie.
 

 
On top of the pie were the heads of four sardines.
 

 
Each fish head’s eye had been roasted white, like they were rolling their eyes, looking exactly like the zombies in the zombie movies Noah had watched. Staring at these eight eyes, Noah found himself frozen.
 

 
Only after seeing these four pairs of eyes could one truly understand what it meant to die with one’s eyes wide open.
 

 
Noah’s whole body stiffened.
 

 
Jiang Dang took off his apron, his movements casual and graceful. He glanced at the rice Noah had served and was satisfied with his obedience. He speared one of the sardine heads with a fork and placed it into Noah’s smaller bowl of rice: “Eat.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this even edible?
 

 
Can it really be eaten?
 

 
Noah shuddered. He really wanted to throw a tantrum and refuse to eat.
 

 
But the man who made this terrifying dish was sitting right across from him, his expression cold and indifferent.
 

 
Unlike the more easily understood Ye Xiaofan, Jiang Dang, known for being a professional villain, was full of mysterious, inscrutable qualities. His deep-set eyes were cold and menacing, not someone you could easily mess with. And let's not forget his graceful but chilling way of speaking.
 

 
Noah looked up at Jiang Dang, then down at the fish head assigned to his bowl.
 

 
It felt...
 

 
Equally terrifying on both sides!
 

 
He also remembered what he'd said earlier, that if he didn’t finish, he would be a dog…
 

 
With a stiff upper lip, Noah pushed the fish head to the side of the bowl.
 

 
[Hmm, I’ll eat this later.]
 

 
[I'll try the other dishes first!]
 

 
Noah was so hungry; he felt like everything would taste good now.
 

 
If it weren’t for that fish head looking so scary, he probably could have eaten it.
 

 
"Which one is the eel?" he asked.
 

 
Jiang Dang motioned toward the porcelain plate on the right with a slight tilt of his chin.
 

 
The dish on the porcelain plate didn’t look like the eel Noah knew.
 

 
The eel Noah recognized was dark brown, glossy with soy sauce, and when cut, the flesh was white and tender. But this fish on the plate, though white, looked a bit strange, its flesh wrapped in a translucent gelatinous layer...
 

 
The live stream’s comments quickly filled with special bullet screens.
 

 
All of them condensed into eight words:
 

 
Quick, quick, quick, quick
 

 
Run, run, run, run
 

 
Noah gathered his courage and picked up a piece. The eel jelly trembled and landed on the rice. He quickly shoveled two bites of rice into his mouth, but the expected rich flavor didn’t come. Instead, the slippery and cool texture made him feel like he might vomit.
 

 
It wasn’t overly fishy, but it had a slight lingering fishiness, and the taste was very subtle.
 

 
Although the audience didn’t get to eat it, from the look of Noah’s scrunched-up face…
 

 
[People on diets thank Jiang Dang.]
 

 
"If you don’t like that, you can try the black pudding," Jiang Dang said softly.
 

 
At the mention of black pudding, Noah’s eyes lit up.
 

 
He’d had pudding before, and it was sweet and delicious.
 

 
Remembering the chocolate he had seen among the ingredients earlier, Noah lowered his guard against the dark, mysterious item. It must taste like chocolate! He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth, his face scrunching up again in disgust.
 

 
[Can someone please tell me what this black pudding really is?]
 

 
[There are sausages with pig’s blood in them; you can imagine they taste like our pig’s blood.]
 

 
[Is it hard to eat?]
 

 
[It’s not exactly bad, but kids probably won’t like it.]
 

 
Noah gritted his teeth and ate bite after bite.
 

 
The taste was so strange, and the fish head with its fish eyes was terrifying. His eyelids reddened, and his eyelashes trembled...
 

 
Even though he was a rebellious child who usually didn’t care about anything, this moment—forcing himself to eat strange food out of pride despite being scared—still tugged at the hearts of many viewers. Some even urged the production team to stop him from eating. The production team explained with white text that the food Jiang Dang made was not only very safe but also rich in nutritional value, so it was absolutely fine for kids to eat.
 

 
As Noah ate, he finally couldn’t hold back and tears dropped down.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan noticed: “... Are you crying?”
 

 
“Ah,” Jiang Dang answered before Noah could: “It must be because I made it so delicious, it made you cry from the deliciousness.”
 

 
The bullet screen quickly filled with a lot of question marks.
 

 
It was as though Jiang Dang was the kind of man who could speak so quickly that the question marks couldn’t keep up with his speed.
 

 
Noah finished his meal with difficulty.
 

 
Jiang Dang, on the other hand, ate with great enjoyment, relaxing and at ease, showing no sign that he had made some terrifying dark cuisine. It seemed he was really used to eating this kind of food and didn’t find anything wrong with it.
 

 
Noah, with tears in his eyes, thought:
 

 
[Does he think I’m a bad kid and is doing this on purpose?]
 

 
Then he looked up and saw that Jiang Dang not only enjoyed his meal but also refilled his bowl.
 

 
Noah felt like he had been struck by lightning.
 

 
[This big brother is really too scary!]
 

 
The bullet screen quickly congratulated Noah for realizing the truth.
 

 
However, Noah had originally said he would "swap parents." Although they were under the same roof, his parents had now been replaced by Jiang Dang. So, he could only watch Ye Xiaofan and Xiao Zhao play normal games, while he secretly glanced at Jiang Dang…
 

 
Noah really wanted to act tough.
 

 
But in front of this man, he felt a bit weak, as if a mouse had encountered a cat.
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the couch and waved for him to come over.
 

 
The man, full and satisfied, stretched his long legs with ease. His thin lips curved into a smile that seemed both present and absent, looking so attractive it made people lower their guard.
 

 
“Would you like to listen to a story?”
 

 
His voice carried a soft warmth, like when he occasionally showed mercy and wrote sweet, cheesy love songs that became popular as background music for many TikTok users. This warm voice captivated Noah’s fragile little heart.
 

 
[Although... listening to a story seems a little cheesy…]
 

 
[But it’s not that bad.]
 

 
Noah awkwardly sat down next to Jiang Dang. "If it's just for me to hear, then I'll listen."
 

 
Jiang Dang glanced at Xiao Zhao, who was having a great time playing with Ye Xiaofan, and smiled with a hint of regret.
 

 
"Alright, I'll only say it for you to hear.”
# Chapter124
Fifteen minutes had passed.
 

 
When Zhao Zai and Ye Xiaofan returned to the living room, sweaty from playing with the motion-sensing game console, they were greeted by a strange sight—
 

 
The usually cool and composed young master, who had managed to hold out despite being hungry all night, was tightly clutching the sofa cushion on his lap. His eyes and the tip of his nose were red, as if he were trying hard to hold back tears.
 

 
Earlier, Zhao Zai had been playing the role of a cat demon in the game, and now, she was even more lively than usual, letting go of her usual formal demeanor. She peeked into the living room, casually meowing as if to intentionally act cute, and in that single "meow," countless viewers' hearts melted. The barrage was flooded with "awsl" (a shorthand for "I’m in love").
 

 
But it was that sudden "meow" that unexpectedly broke Noah’s last shred of rationality.
 

 
He threw the pillow aside, jumped off the sofa, and while running, he wailed loudly, "Wah... I... I want to go home... Wuuu... I don’t want you guys, don’t kill me..."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan stared in disbelief at Jiang Dang, sitting on the sofa. "Did you hit him?"
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang innocently looked back at him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought the same.
 

 
The only thing Jiang Dang had to do with violence was being slapped by a female celebrity...
 

 
Who was that female celebrity again? It seemed like part of his memory had been clouded or erased, Ye Xiaofan couldn't recall. After pondering for a while, he gave up on trying to remember. "Damn it, I'm no good at comforting kids."
 

 
"I’ll go," Zhao Zai sighed as she left.
 

 
...
 

 
After Zhao Zai left, Ye Xiaofan puzzled, "What did you do to him? He’s crying so badly.”
 

 
"I told him a bedtime story."
 

 
Jiang Dang's gaze was clear, and Ye Xiaofan could almost sense a hint of "what did the child do wrong" in his expression. But his intuition told him that the blame squarely fell on Jiang Dang. There was no one else to blame. He was suspicious and asked, "Really?"
 

 
"Really."
 

 
Jiang Dang tilted his head slightly.
 

 
The barrage quickly added a caption:
 
"What bad intentions can a psychopath have?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan almost believed him. He asked what kind of scary bedtime story he had told.
 

 
"It was Stephen King's novel ‘The Mist’. Well, it was more of an adaptation. It would take too long to tell the entire story, but when I was studying in the UK, I always used his books as bedtime reading, reading them over and over again. When I thought of a story to tell, this one came to mind first."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a gentle smile: "Do you want to hear it?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan looked at his smile, almost mesmerized, and mindlessly nodded.
 

 
By the time he finished listening to Jiang Dang’s story, Ye Xiaofan felt dazed.
 

 
How to explain it?
 

 
It wasn’t exactly a very scary story, but the overwhelming sense of despair, helplessness, and mysterious terror, along with Jiang Dang’s soft voice, fit together perfectly. The two sentences he spoke slowly drew the listener into that foggy, monster-filled world: "The most absurd part is that the protagonist felt there was no escape. Dying at the hands of the monster was painful and humiliating. In his desperation, after ending his own family’s suffering, he… suddenly found that rescue really had arrived? This ending is so soul-crushing, so mind-bending. Can this kind of content even be aired?"
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel Ye Xiaofan’s unease.
 

 
Forget about bedtime stories—if he heard this kind of story during the day, he would probably be so disturbed that he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.
 

 
Jiang Dang actually used that as bedtime reading material!
 

 
There were so many things to criticize that Ye Xiaofan couldn’t even process them all at once. He only managed to come up with one comment: "Jiang Dang, sometimes... your voice kind of sounds like tentacles."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a smile, as if he had received a compliment.
 

 
On the other side, the rebellious young master Noah was at his limit.
 

 
He instinctively retreated into a dark, secluded corner where he felt safe, biting his arm to stifle his sobs. His tears flowed in large drops, and his mind was filled with all sorts of grotesque and terrifying creatures, lurking everywhere.
 

 
Jiang Dang felt that his skills at taking care of children had improved.
 

 
Last night, when he told Tong Zhao a bedtime story, it was very rigid and straightforward. Today, he had refined his storytelling technique, switching to a second-person narrative that was more immersive, with interactive questions like, “You hurried into a supermarket in a panic. The cashier has been facing away from you for a long time, and even after hearing your footsteps, doesn’t turn around. Do you want to ask them what’s going on around here?” This technique aimed to enhance the sense of immersion for the child.
 

 
The villa was huge, and Noah was fast enough to run at full speed. Tong Zhao had to check each room to find him.
 

 
In the end, she heard faint crying from inside the children’s room closet.
 

 
She opened the door and saw a small figure huddled inside.
 

 
Noah had his face buried in his arm, curled up among the clothes, looking like a mushroom growing in the corner, drooping and wilted.
 

 
"You’re crying," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"I’m not crying! Go away!" Noah snapped fiercely.
 

 
His "go away" caused some strong reactions in the comments.
 

 
Some felt that Tong Zhao shouldn’t bother with him and should just let him deal with it himself.
 

 
Others thought that although his attitude was bad, he wasn’t throwing tantrums, breaking furniture, or cursing adults. He was just refusing to eat and letting himself go hungry, so he wasn’t really that much of a troublemaker after all.
 

 
[He’s so fierce.]
 

 
[I need to figure out a way to make him stop being so fierce.]
 

 
The smart AI detected Zhao Zai’s thoughts, and the next moment, they heard her clearing her throat and imitating Jiang Dang’s tone with a little sweet voice, asking, “Excuse me, little friend, may I take up some of your time? I’d like to talk to you about our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Cthulhu…”
 

 
“...Waaa!!!”
 

 
At the sound of that tone, Noah’s scalp went numb, and he shrank even more into a tiny ball.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[This is the real devil, isn’t it!!!]
 

 
[Pure evil from the start, this mischievous kid doesn’t stand a chance against them, run!]
 

 
Noah wasn’t just crying out of fear; he also felt very wronged.
 

 
No one here was focusing on him, trying to comfort him or indulge him.
 

 
He had endured his hunger to preserve his dignity, thinking that once he made it through, things would get better. But instead, he was forced to eat strange, unappetizing food, while the little girl next to him got to enjoy normal, tasty meals and seemed so happy about it. All the accumulated grievances, combined with Jiang Dang's terrifying story, finally broke his resolve.
 

 
Zhao Zai furrowed her brow, sensing that the situation wasn’t simple.
 

 
[Actually, I don’t really have experience comforting others…]
 

 
[And I don’t think I’ve ever been comforted either.]
 

 
Amidst the little boy’s cries, Zhao Zai vaguely recalled some memories—someone once praised her for being born strong, with a strong sense of mission in whatever she did, being too strict with herself, unwilling to show weakness to others, and never giving anyone a chance to pity her…
 

 
Who said that again?
 

 
I can't remember.
 

 
This sentence was a bit too complicated for Zhao Zai. After thinking for a while, she felt a headache and decided not to think about it anymore.
 

 
Zhao Zai sighed in her heart, opened her arms, and hugged him.
 

 
A thousand words couldn’t compare to a warm hug~
 

 
“Yes, it’s me, I’m here. If the sky falls, I’ll hold it up. What Jiang Dang said was all fake. I also heard him tell a scary story last night and had a nightmare, so you’re not the only one who’s scared.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Noah shuddered a bit, lifted his face from his arm, and secretly looked at her.
 

 
“It’s not good. He… he said at the end of the story… that once you hear it, you should never think about it again, because if you think about it, then… it’s….” Noah hiccuped with fear and tears. “Thinking about it is like calling it. If you think about it too much, it’ll notice you. But I… I just can’t stop thinking about it…”
 

 
The little boy anxiously bumped his head against the wardrobe.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[Jiang Dang is truly inhuman, there wasn’t such a setting in the original ‘The Mist’, he added that part himself!]
 

 
[He’s a true genius of ghost stories, how could you not think about it!]
 

 
When Noah hit the wardrobe for the third time, his forehead bumped into something soft.
 

 
[...What did I just bump into?]
 

 
Noah blinked through his teary eyes, confused and puzzled.
 

 
Zhao Zai: “It’s a tentacle.”
 

 
Noah: “!!!”
 

 
"I was joking," Zhao Zai raised his chin with one hand. "It’s my hand."
 

 
Noah saw a delicate, soft hand.
 

 
He bit his lip, remembering how hard he had just bumped into it. "Did I hurt you? What’s wrong with you, why did you put your hand up..."
 

 
His voice, still soft and childish from crying, was gentle and tender.
 

 
"A little, but I didn’t want you to hurt your head either."
 

 
Zhao Zai’s eyes, shining like tiny fireflies in the dark, were clear and enchanting.
 

 
Under her steady gaze, Noah suddenly couldn’t bring himself to say anything harsh.
 

 
His face was burning hot, like it was on fire, just like the first time he saw her.
 

 
Children awaken to love far earlier than adults can imagine. The concept of avoiding early relationships like a plague is unique to Chinese schools, and while there may be some truth to it, human emotions can’t be confined or erased. It’s like a little green sprout quietly pushing up from the earth after the rain, the seed having fallen without notice, and the nourishment unknown. It may never bloom, but it will leave behind a small, beautiful thought for a lifetime.
 

 
Simple, untainted.
 

 
"You... you're silly..."
 

 
Noah grabbed her hand roughly and rubbed it against his palm where he had bumped it earlier.
 

 
He had been too frantic before, not recalling how hard he had hit.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to say that the back of his hand, which had slammed into the wardrobe, hurt more, but his rubbing actually hurt too. "It doesn't hurt, let me give you a hug. I'm here for you."
 

 
As she spoke, she patted his back.
 

 
Noah flared up. "Are you treating me like a little kid?"
 

 
Loli, confused: "Aren’t you a little kid?”
 

 
Innocent deer-like eyes fixedly looked at him.
 

 
The adults at home never acknowledged his needs. The only way Noah could get their attention was by crying or throwing a tantrum — because when he became too much of a hassle, the adults had no choice but to take him seriously. If he behaved and listened quietly, his needs, his thoughts, and his feelings would all be ignored.
 

 
Over time, Noah forgot how to communicate with others in a normal way.
 

 
Even in this moment, when warmth filled his chest, Noah couldn’t find the right words to say.
 

 
He thought and thought, countless words passing his lips, only to be swallowed back down.
 

 
Finally, he mumbled an apology in a voice as soft as a mosquito's hum:
 

 
"...Sorry."
 

 
"Sorry for what?"
 

 
"Just..."
 

 
He whispered even more quietly.
 

 
In the big wardrobe, two little children hid, mumbling to each other.
 

 
Noah didn’t like to soften, didn’t like to apologize.
 

 
"I only apologize to you. You’re not allowed to tell anyone else!"
 

 
"And also, you can't bring up this apology with me again."
 

 
He said it in a fierce tone.
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded vigorously.
 

 
"We're speaking so softly in the wardrobe, they definitely can't hear us."
 

 
At this moment, the live stream of "Baby Chaos" had already surpassed 200,000 viewers.
# Chapter125
Once Noah stopped hiccupping from crying, Zhao Zai took him to the bathroom to wash his face.
 

 
Zhao Zai had the mentality of an older sibling, wanting to keep an eye on him even while he washed his face. However, the little boy, his face red with embarrassment, gently pushed her out — this time, it was a soft push without much force, but his attitude was firm: "You go out, I can wash my face by myself."
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused: "Are you going to pee?"
 

 
"I'm not!" Noah loudly denied it. "I went in first, so this place is the men's bathroom now. You're a girl, you can't come in."
 

 
This logic convinced Zhao Zai.
 

 
She indeed couldn't enter the men's bathroom, so she had no choice but to stand outside with a face full of regret.
 

 
The audience watched as the small Zhao Zai stood with her back to the bathroom door, raising her voice: "Be careful washing your face~ Remember to scrub your hands for at least thirty seconds!"
 

 
"I know, you're so annoying!" Noah quickly retorted from inside the bathroom, scrubbing his hands with such speed that his little claws seemed to be on fire.
 

 
Once the shyness passed, Noah came out, now calmer, and quickly whispered in the little girl's ear: "When I said you were annoying, I didn't mean it. I wasn't scolding you!"
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Zhao Zai raised her hand and touched her ear.
 

 
This child really likes to speak loudly in her ear. She might go deaf.
 

 
---
 

 
Behind the scenes, the production team could clearly see that this temporary family had the highest viewership ratings.
 

 
The combination of Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao was a real attention-grabber.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was more or less riding their coattails.
 

 
At first, Noah's popularity among the audience was quite low. However, as he interacted more with Zhao Zai, all the data showed that the public's perception of him was improving, and the irrational insults toward him were decreasing significantly.
 

 
The staff on the afternoon shift sighed:
 

 
"Mini version of Zhao Zai is really an angel. Whoever she plays with becomes really likable."
 

 
The female screenwriter watched for a while and said, "I think she’s the type who naturally gets a lot of attention and everyone expects her to do amazing things, but it’s easy to overlook that she’s just a little girl who needs care and love from adults."
 

 
This little girl, who was more self-disciplined and responsible than many adults, naturally reached out and took Noah's hand, leading him back to the living room.
 

 
Perhaps after talking to Jiang Dang for a while, Ye Xiaofan caught the habit of mentioning things best left unsaid, and asked right away: "Where did you go to cry just now?"
 

 
Noah glared at him: "I didn't cry! Do you have any proof?"
 

 
Ah...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan couldn't help but notice his red, swollen eyes.
 

 
Before he could ask again, Zhao Zai quickly took over the conversation: "I was the one who cried, and Noah was comforting me."
 

 
She took small steps forward and tugged at the two big brothers:
 

 
"We’re a family now, right? Let’s all play the game together later~"
 

 
[I'm declaring Zhao Zai as the emotional intelligence ceiling of this family.]
 

 
[Then what about Jiang Dang? Is he the emotional intelligence floor?]
 

 
[He must be the emotional intelligence basement.]
 

 
[He’s so deep, we’ve reached the center of the earth, don’t mention it.]
 

 
As the saying goes, "the rich help the poor." The production team, aiming for balanced attention, decided to add group games and activities for all the guests to participate in. While Zhao Zai excelled at everything, she didn't have the habit of grabbing attention or trying to be the center of focus, and was more than happy to let other children take the spotlight.
 

 
Xiao Quan was timid and often stood quietly on the side, feeling a little down.
 

 
So, the two who most fiercely tried to avoid attention were Jia Jia and Noah. Neither of them was willing to give in, especially when it came to the privilege of playing with Zhao Zai. In the end, it usually resulted in Jia Jia slightly outperforming Noah.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "going to the bathroom together" was a privilege for same-gender children.
 

 
No matter how powerless and angry Noah got, his face turning red...
 

 
He simply couldn’t bring himself to invite Zhao Zai to hold hands and go to the bathroom together.
 

 
Although the younger guests were all quite attached to Zhao Zai, she hadn’t forgotten her original mission. She took time to teach Jiang Dang the simplest ballet steps. Jiang Dang didn’t treat it as just a trick to win her over but studied it seriously, even showing off a small routine at the end of the program.
 

 
Jiang Dang took it seriously, and Zhao Zai, as the little teacher, was quite pleased.
 

 
However, in the live stream, Jiang Dang’s female fans were covering their faces, unable to resist peeking through their fingers. After watching, they couldn’t get enough and even took screenshots as souvenirs.
 

 
When a man wears ballet tights, the size is clearly visible.
 

 
Even when he wasn’t in battle mode, it was still quite astonishing.
 

 
The comments flooded in:
 

 
[Is this content even allowed to air???]
 

 
[If it weren’t for your comments, no one would think that way!]
 

 
[Is Jiang Dang a 1? Is he a 1? Is he a 1?]
 

 
[My big straight man, thank you.]
 

 
Before the program ended, there was a small incident.
 

 
As Noah spent more time interacting with the other two little guests during the activities, they became friends. But whenever he thought about leaving the show and having to travel with his parents again, alone without any playmates, he would feel so sad that he secretly shed tears. He wished he could hide so the adults wouldn’t find him, and the show wouldn’t have to end.
 

 
The production team also invited the real parents of the little guests to watch the live broadcast in the studio. They filmed their reactions and interviewed them about their thoughts.
 

 
In a holographic variety show, where could they hide?
 

 
Moreover, Noah’s hiding spot wasn’t very clever. After a small hint from the production team, Zhao Zai found him again.
 

 
The three little guests promised that they would keep in touch after the show ended and that they would still be good friends.
 

 
After Jia Jia and Xiao Quan spoke, Noah was already wiping his tears.
 

 
Just as Zhao Zai was about to say something, Noah shook his head forcefully: “Don’t be friends!”
 

 
[Advice to the child: Don’t be ungrateful.]
 

 
[Is he turning his back on Zhao?]
 

 
[This kid is ungrateful.]
 

 
Because, on the show, Zhao Zai had been very caring toward him, and the audience jokingly called her "the one who brought an extra son," like a big treasure looking after a little treasure.
 

 
However, the next moment, Noah’s words stunned the audience—
 

 
“After we go out, I want you to be my bride.”
 

 
Noah’s light brown eyes were moist and clear, like a bright sky. He was trembling with nervousness, still carrying the emotional tone of the tears he had shed earlier. His mixed-race face looked as handsome as a prince straight out of a fairytale, worthy of a childhood sweetheart princess.
 

 
And speaking of princesses, is there anyone in this show more suited than Zhao Zai?
 

 
None of the guests noticed that Noah harbored such awkward and inexperienced affection for Zhao Zai. After all, the other two little kids were also very clingy to her, and Noah clearly didn’t understand the complexities of the situation. He thought his dad was cold toward others but kind to his mom, and he wanted to be kind to Zhao Zai too. He wanted her to be his bride.
 

 
“Ah?”
 

 
The little princess was puzzled.
 

 
Now that it was out in the open, Noah, with the air of someone who had nothing to lose, declared to all the adults with a royal confidence: “On the first day, you said you wanted a big plane and a big ship, and I’ll buy them for you in the future, if you become my bride!”
 

 
He said it with such bold, unrestrained confidence.
 

 
However, before his words even settled, Zhao Zai, who had been in a daze, was suddenly picked up by Jiang Dang:
 

 
“It’s time for your ballet lesson, little princess.”
 

 
Noah tilted his head back, and the first thing he saw was the man with a sharp nose and thin lips, who wore a distant, indifferent smile in his deep black eyes. When viewed from the side, his handsome profile resembled that of a cold, aloof fox. The arm he had around Zhao Zai was very conspicuous. Yet, when he turned to look at Zhao Zai, his expression softened into a pure, paternal smile, and Noah felt a surge of irritation.
 

 
[What the hell, I just discovered a love triangle on this variety show.]
 

 
[Especially now that I know Zhao Zai isn’t really a little kid… this is even more fun.]
 

 
[To those of you who’ve been hooked by this, come join me in shipping the Dang-Zhao couple. Check out the Bilibili video “How to Conquer Me” for more.]
 

 
It was all in good fun and light teasing.
 

 
It's considered unethical to pair children together for shipping. That’s a sacred space that shouldn’t be tainted by profit. The production team of ‘Baby Chaos’ didn’t intentionally try to create a couple, but it can only be said that Zhao Zai is too lovable, a little sunbeam that cures arrogance. The simple, innocent feelings Noah expressed towards her, like wanting to be with her every day, hold her hand, and be her best friend, are pure and straightforward.
 

 
What kind of feeling is this? No one could categorize it.
 

 
It was more like the innocent fondness and admiration that one little cub might have for another.
 

 
Since Noah said it was love, then perhaps it was!
 

 
Time would tell, anyway.
 

 
The show ended with a group photo of all the participants before they left the park.
 

 
---
 

 
When Zhao Zai woke up, she immediately rolled down from her main personality's position.
 

 
And she really rolled.
 

 
She was still very young, and among the many personalities, she was one of the more incomplete and fragile ones. After finishing the entire variety show, she was so tired that she almost collapsed. She was swiftly scooped up by the sharp-eyed, quick-handed Consort Chen, who instructed Han Zhi to carry her back to the room to rest.
 

 
Han Zhi: "Zhao Zai hasn't woken up yet."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Let her rest for a while. I'll take over."
 

 
Consort Chen was the most glamorous and star-like personality among them.
 

 
She was used to being adored by the public. In the past, anyone who saw her had to kneel and call her "Consort." Even the most noble, like the emperor, would privately wash her feet for her. Sometimes, when attending large events, if Tong Zhao decided to be lazy and didn’t show up, she would send her substitute.
 

 
Master Lu didn’t think much of it: "Let her take the throne for an hour, and the matchmaker will have to work overtime for a month."
 

 
"Learn some new words and use them. I, your aunt, am very noble, and ordinary men aren't worthy."
 

 
Consort Chen was a little upset by her sarcastic remarks. After sitting in the main personality’s position, she wore a face of displeasure.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a separate filming room.
 

 
The room had a clean bathroom and a makeup table, so the celebrities could freshen up before meeting people.
 

 
Consort Chen sat in front of the makeup table, touching up her makeup.
 

 
At this time, a staff member came in with hot tea: "Because the modeling is special, Sister Xiao Zhao is the last to wake up. The other guests have already rested for a day. Would you like to watch the raw footage? I can play it now."
 

 
Some guests care a lot about their performance on the show, but since the memories from the holographic shoot hadn’t fully come back yet, they could only review the raw footage to reflect on it. For guests like Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, there were staff members who would specially check on them after they woke up.
 

 
No need to send an assistant to ask—raw footage would be delivered directly to them.
 

 
"No need, thank you."
 

 
Consort Chen focused on retouching her makeup in the mirror.
 

 
For her, it seemed that making herself more beautiful was the most important thing in the world. She didn’t care about how her "self" had performed on the show. Of course, this didn’t mean she didn’t love her "self," it was just... which personality would mess things up? That was impossible, so she didn’t worry about it at all.
 

 
She’d rather think about what color eyeshadow to use.
 

 
Consort Chen liked vibrant, bright colors. After Master Lu criticized her, it made the Consort unhappy. Now, her makeup tone leaned towards a more aggressive style, and she picked the brightest lipstick from her makeup bag. The staff member beside her secretly admired her—if it weren’t for her stunning beauty, who could pull off such a bold color in everyday life?
 

 
True, a female star's "everyday" life couldn’t even really be called "everyday."
 

 
Because she had just woken up from the holographic shoot, her face was slightly pale. Her soft lips were painted with bright red lipstick, and her cool, fair skin made her look like a beautiful woman stepping out of a dark, mystical painting. Her long hair fell beside her face, embodying the classic beauty of black hair, white skin, and red lips.
 

 
The staff member had been watching the filming of the show the entire time.
 

 
She couldn’t help but reflect in her heart—who could have imagined that such an angelic little girl like Tong Zhao would grow up to become such a powerful, elegant beauty?
 

 
When Tong Zhao had just said "thank you" to her, she honestly couldn’t feel the gratitude in those words.
 

 
It was as if it was only natural for others to serve her, to be kind to her.
 

 
What was even more puzzling was that when the staff member realized she was being treated this way... she wasn’t even upset? She wasn’t arrogant, just... everything felt natural.
 

 
The staff member stopped thinking about it.
 

 
After all, delivering footage and water to the guests was part of her job.
 

 
Next to "Tong Zhao," the staff member instinctively held her breath.
 

 
The filming room was silent.
 

 
At that moment, the sound of running footsteps in the hallway broke the silence, followed by the staff member's helpless shout: “Noah, wait, don’t run around! Although Tong Zhao has woken up, she might not have rested well…”
 

 
"I’ll be good and quiet, and I’ll stay with her while she rests!"
 

 
Noah's childish voice could be heard from far away.
 

 
You couldn’t hide a child's voice. The tone was full of eagerness, and also a bit of panic.
 

 
When Noah thought of the three friends he had made on the show, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia had already met up, but Tong Zhao had been nowhere to be found. The staff member said she had woken up the latest and they would have to wait for her. If she woke up, they would let him know…
 

 
No one knew how to explain this to the child.
 

 
Since Noah was mixed-race, apart from filming this show, he had been flying around the world with his parents, rarely engaging with Chinese films, and couldn’t even read all the Chinese characters. Tong Zhao may have been popular, but she hadn’t reached the level of fame in Hollywood.
 

 
So, Noah, who was in the dark, couldn’t wait any longer.
 

 
He believed that Tong Zhao would definitely understand him. He would stay quietly by her side and not cause any trouble. Once he saw her, he would apologize properly and tell her he couldn’t wait to see her.
 

 
The common trait between children and adults is that, when they like someone, they rush toward them.
 

 
No need to hide it, no need to learn it.
 

 
The filming room door was half-open, and Noah knew that the little princess was sleeping behind it. He barged in—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, I’m here!”
 

 
……
 

 
……
 

 
“Huh?”
 

 
A long time later, Noah still couldn’t forget that lazy, melodious voice.
 

 
It was different from the little princess he remembered.
 

 
But he could vaguely see the same person in her features.
 

 
The woman in front of him clearly looked like someone who had fully matured, her tone lazy, her eyes glancing at him with a detached, indifferent look.
 

 
"Did you call me?"
 

 
"I... I’m looking for Tong Zhao."
 

 
He said it softly, his tone weakening.
 

 
Noah was usually quite bold with adults.
 

 
But in front of this woman, he couldn’t muster his usual bravado.
 

 
The Consort was an exceptional beauty among women, but Noah hadn’t yet matured enough to understand her allure or be tempted by her. He simply felt that she exuded a terrifying, unapproachable aura, almost like the snake spirit in ‘Calabash Brothers’ or the evil queen in ‘Snow White’...
 

 
"I am Tong Zhao."
 

 
Noah was afraid of her, and the Consort didn’t particularly like children either.
 

 
Moreover, just before, Master Lu had teased her, saying she always attracted troublesome admirers. She was in a bad mood, and this time, she just wanted to dress up nicely, with no interest in anyone. She had even less patience for coaxing a little brat like Noah. "Is there something you need?"
 

 
"I... I... you... you..."
 

 
Noah lost his words.
 

 
At that moment, a staff member who had caught up squatted down to explain to little Noah about Tong Zhao's situation.
 

 
Noah wasn’t dumb. When he finally understood that his innocent first love, his little bride, was actually a big sister...
 

 
He stood frozen in place.
 

 
His mindset crumbled like the Niagara Falls—completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Who am I? Where am I?
 

 
Who is she?
 

 
The little princess in his memory had a soft, fair face and cute lips. She would gently call him Noah, care for him, be especially kind to him, and tolerate his stubborn, bad temper. After recovering his memories, Noah had resolved to change his attitude. In the past, he didn’t care if others disliked him, but now, he didn’t want to be disliked by Zhao Zai.
 

 
"Is this the kid from the show? I haven’t recovered my memory, so I don’t remember who you are,"
 

 
The big sister’s bright red lips curved into a distant, polite smile. Her face was still incredibly beautiful, but it was nothing like Noah’s familiar image of her.
 

 
"If there’s nothing special, then forget about me."
 

 
This conversation felt like a kingfisher releasing a fish back into the water.
 

 
Having experienced the cruelty and unfairness of love at an early age, Noah didn’t cry out loud. He was just very confused:
 

 
"Will Zhao Zai become like you when she grows up?"
 

 
Noticing the disdain and disappointment in the little boy's words, the Consort raised an eyebrow and scoffed, "Probably. If there’s something you want to say to her, it’s the same if you say it to me. I can simulate her answer for you."
 

 
After all, the personalities knew each other very well.
 

 
Noah stood there in a daze, continuing to doubt his life:
 

 
"I originally wanted to ask if you could be my bride when you grow up..."
 

 
Oh, so it turns out you’re a subject under my skirt.
 

 
Although he had no memory of the person in front of him, Noah was still a very handsome boy. His appearance revealed many admirable qualities, making him a potential suitor—someone who could be considered a decent prospect, which made the Empress Dowager take a second glance at Zhao Zai. In her memory, she had never been involved in "puppy love," but she had always had male classmates who liked her.
 

 
Attracting men’s affection—just as expected of her.
 

 
Consort Chen mentally gave herself a thumbs-up.
 

 
Her lips finally curled into a more sincere smile as she repeated her earlier words:
 

 
"Forget about me."
 

 
After speaking, Consort Chen gently cupped the boy’s stunned face with her delicate hands and kissed his forehead. She then turned away, casually checking her WeChat messages on her phone, her body language making it clear that she would not give this little boy any more hope.
 

 
Noah lifted his hand to cover his forehead.
 

 
There was a faint trace of a lingering red mark.
 

 
He stared at the Consort Chen in disbelief—
 

 
Bad! Woman!
 

 
Noah arrived full of excitement, only to leave with doubts about life.
 

 
Meanwhile, Consort Chen casually flipped through her WeChat messages.
 

 
As she saw it, there were only three men who might have a chance with "herself." Shi Qianqiu had some sparks with her, but it seemed he wasn’t interested in taking it further and preferred to keep the relationship as a good director-actor bond... Consort Chen could understand him—after all, for him, a girlfriend was easy to find, but a beloved lead actress was rare.
 

 
What if the relationship soured after getting involved?
 

 
Plus, it wasn’t like she couldn’t live without him.
 

 
This mature and effortless way of handling things greatly impressed Shi Qianqiu in Consort Chen's mind. The more difficult a man was to handle, the more interesting he seemed. However, Zhao Zhao might not agree with that.
 

 
As for Wei Zekai...
 

 
When she opened his chat, the corners of Consort Chen's lips twitched in a rather ungraceful manner.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You were so cute when you were little.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [That little brat is kind of annoying.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Damn, I can tell he's not sincere! Don’t get involved in early love!]
 

 
...
 

 
The kids knew more about fighting for what they wanted than he did.
 

 
After reading Wei Zekai’s usual ramblings, Consort Chen had an urge to call Noah back. If he was willing to start striving from now on, aiming to become a world leader or the President of the United States, she might be willing to consider it.
 

 
After a brief pause, Consort Chen typed: [What about you? Are you sincere with me?]
 

 
Not long after the message was sent, Zhao Zhao woke up.
 

 
Seeing her having fun, Zhao Zhao didn’t rush to reclaim her seat. She was still a little groggy from sleep, and since the memories of the other personalities hadn’t flooded back yet, she didn’t know what Consort Chen had been up to behind her back. So, she suspiciously asked: [What happened while I was gone…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [How could I tarnish someone's reputation without reason? Not only did I avoid causing any trouble, but I also helped you fend off the bad suitors!]
 

 
【Bad suitors?】
 

 
[Hmm…] Consort Chen thought for a moment. [Maybe I should say, the bad seeds.]
 

 
Zhao Zhao still believed her.
 

 
After all, while Consort Chen was popular with men, she was also very good at rejecting them.
 

 
After saying that, Consort Chen returned the main personality's position to her.
 

 
Before Zhao Zhao could recall her manipulative actions, Consort Chen swiftly ran off and closed the door.
 

 
Once the door was closed, Consort Chen no longer cared for anyone.
 

 
Zhao Zhao blinked, and in the mirror, she saw her makeup looking even more cold and glamorous than usual.
 

 
If not for the team’s request, she would have preferred a gentler, more elegant style.
 

 
Then, her phone vibrated.
 

 
Zhao Zhao looked down—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I... don’t know.]
 

 
What does he not know?
 

 
Zhao Zhao scrolled up and found the question Consort Chen had sent, and everything became clear.
 

 
As she was thinking about how to reply, Wei Zekai sent another message: [Can you give me some time to think?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [You still need to think?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I was going to say something simple, like 'brotherhood is stronger than gold, with unbreakable loyalty,' but before I sent it, I suddenly didn’t feel like saying that anymore. I don’t know why, let me think it over.]
 

 
He sent a meme of a little cat in a toilet, with the caption: [I can’t figure it out.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You’re awake? Once you’re rested, let’s have a team-building day. We miss you!]
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Zhao Zhao's lips curved slightly.
 

 
Xiao Kai had always been slow in matters of love, and Zhao Zhao felt she was also a person full of uncertainty. She had gone through so much, and it seemed like she was a bundle of contradictions... She simply didn’t have the time to figure others out, only wanting to understand herself first.
 

 
To her surprise, part of her memory from the variety show had already been restored.
 

 
Zhao Zhao felt that her mental strength had grown again, which is why she recovered faster than others.
 

 
In the variety show, Zhao Zhao remembered someone had praised her for having a strong sense of purpose, never giving others the chance to pity her. But she couldn’t remember who that person was.
 

 
Now, she remembered.
 

 
It was after she completed a quick-transmigration task, when the system gave her the task evaluation.
 

 
What was that task again?
 

 
As Zhao Zhao pondered deeper, a door deep within her memory palace slowly creaked open.
 

 
It was a door covered in yellow high-risk seals and iron chains.
# Chapter126
System: [Warning!] [Warning!]
 

 
[Host, please promptly unlock this personality in a space with high privacy and security!]
 

 
It had been years since Zhao Zhao last heard a system prompt, and she actually felt a bit nostalgic. Before, whenever her missions were almost completed, she would often receive warnings from the system. Zhao Zhao had a high level of trust in the system, so without questioning it, she politely declined the program's invitation to stay for a celebratory meal, using the excuse of not feeling well. She took the nanny van and quickly returned.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao locked herself in her room, the lock on the deepest door had already been knocked off.
 

 
The consciousness palace was eerily quiet.
 

 
In the grand hall, Lu Xianchang stayed with her, while everyone else returned to their rooms.
 

 
In Zhao Zhao's quick-transmigration journey, only Lu Xianchang was from a fantasy world, one with high magic and martial arts. Even though they had arrived in an era with thin spiritual energy, Lu Xianchang still managed to use effective methods to cultivate. It was unlikely that she could embark on the immortal path again, as the conditions of spiritual energy weren’t there, but she was definitely superior to ordinary people in many ways.
 

 
So, had she been to other high-magic worlds in her numerous instances?
 

 
Zhao Zhao couldn’t remember.
 

 
Perhaps within those various doors, there were also personalities with special abilities.
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [Do you not remember who is behind this door?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [I don't remember.] She gave a bitter smile. [Zhao Zai, because she is a part of my childhood self, I clearly remember her, which is why I was able to think of her before I opened the door. I can only feel that this personality is a bit dangerous.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [More dangerous than Duan Ge?]
 

 
Duan Ge, having lived through a blood-soaked apocalyptic world, often harbored a desire for violence and a tendency for bloodshed, even when she returned to a peaceful era. This could hardly be blamed on her; in those times, even a moment of mercy could mean death for herself and the young companions she led. For instance, when she participated in ‘One Life Survivor’, Duan Ge killed twenty people in a holographic world, which allowed her to release her violent and brutal rage. In the real world, those twenty people were unharmed, and the entire program, including her, gained both fame and fortune.
 

 
This was why Zhao Zhao felt she needed to keep performing, to help the various personalities find a balance between the illusory and the real.
 

 
Zhao Zhao considered for a moment: [...Probably.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang reassured her: [It’s fine. No matter how dangerous a person is, there's no reason to harm oneself.]
 

 
All the personalities loved Zhao Zhao.
 

 
Asking the other personalities to return to their rooms wasn’t out of fear of death. After all, they were all in the same boat, so why fear anything? It was just that they didn’t want to trigger the new friend. Zhao Zhao was very protective of them.
 

 
Zhao Zhao cupped her face: [So, I just found a quiet place to wait for her to come out.]
 

 
This feeling was a bit strange, like waiting for a monster egg to hatch.
 

 
Before the eggshell cracked, no one knew what kind of monster would emerge.
 

 
While the two were chatting in a casual manner, the door lock fell, and a pale white hand appeared.
 

 
It was as if this white hand had been nurtured in countless, lightless deep chambers.
 

 
The young girl was dressed in a pure white silk saree, adorned with intricate gold and silver threads, both bright and dark, shimmering as she moved. However, her saree was more revealing than the traditional version, exposing her slender waist and thighs, barely covered.
 

 
She wore a lot of accessories: large, vivid red rubies, gold ornaments, and water diamonds. Her platinum blonde hair was styled into a Greek goddess braid at the back of her head, with perfectly round, lustrous pearls strung together in a chain and woven into the braid.
 

 
With so many accessories, none of them could outshine the girl's natural beauty.
 

 
The pearls paled in comparison to her milk-like skin.
 

 
The rubies dimmed before her lips.
 

 
Even supreme authority was nothing more than a long stick she kicked around, slightly uncomfortable to the touch.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao saw that face she had seen countless times in the mirror, yet slightly different now, she remembered her name.
 

 
"Iya, you're awake."
 

 
She blurted it out.
 

 
"I'm awake..."
 

 
The girl, called Iya, gave her a sweet smile, and her voice was filled with a complex, crazy joy:
 

 
"Will there be my followers here?"
 

 
＊
 

 
Along with the name came the vast memories from that world.
 

 
Even the reason why she had forgotten this personality entirely was remembered at the same time...
 

 
System: "Because you stayed in that world for too long, your previous mental capacity wasn't enough to hold the full version of 'Iya,' so it was temporarily sealed."
 

 
To put it bluntly, the previous configuration wasn't sufficient.
 

 
Forcing the application to run would have burned out the graphics card or overloaded the memory.
 

 
That was the first time Zhao Zhao traveled to a Western fantasy world.
 

 
In that world, it was common to have both gods of light and demon gods.
 

 
The God of Light represents the order of the entire continent. Believing in it grants the power of faith, and with this power, warriors and mages can combat the dark creatures. What kind of order is this? It's like no matter what job you have, if you want to protect the value of your money, you ultimately have to get involved with the investment industry.
 

 
The power of faith is like that.
 

 
You can have any elemental attribute—metal, wood, water, fire, or earth—but if you want to use it in actual combat against enemies from the abyss, you must believe in the God of Light. At the time, Zhao Zhao thought, if Sasuke from ‘Naruto’ came and wanted to perform a Fire Style jutsu, he would first have to pray to the God of Light, to infuse his chakra with the power of light... Ah, no, the power of light.
 

 
The identity that the system assigned to Zhao Zhao in this world was that of a saintess from a rural temple.
 

 
Strictly speaking, she was a saintess in reserve.
 

 
In the rural temple, there were dozens of other saintesses in reserve, and across the entire continent, there were over a hundred temples. Ultimately, only one person could truly become the saintess after passing numerous trials.
 

 
The saintess trial was like the imperial exams of the Western fantasy world.
 

 
But it wasn’t so public, more like an unspoken secret.
 

 
Zhao Zhao had long been accustomed to starting in difficult situations, where one wrong move could cost her life. So, she accepted this setting without resistance, hiding her sharp edges, and decided to follow the rules of this world.
 

 
At that time, the system only issued one task: to complete the current trial.
 

 
Zhao Zhao completed task after task, gradually learning how sinful this land, blessed by the God of Light, truly was. The saintess trial in the rural temple was simple: it required beauty, a good figure, and virginity, along with a written exam. Cultural knowledge couldn’t be too low, and the affinity with the God of Light had to be high.
 

 
Affinity with the God of Light referred to how firm one’s belief was.
 

 
Because the difficulty of this world was unusually high, the system granted Zhao Zhao administrator-level permissions—just as the system could consider the host’s endurance limits and seal parts of her memories, she, upon gaining this permission, could rewrite her own beliefs, deeply hypnotizing herself until she even began to believe her own lies.
 

 
The first line of code Zhao Zhao rewrote was her deep, unwavering belief in the God of Light.
 

 
Even if she performed actions that violated the teachings, she could genuinely justify them as acts of piety, and this would not affect her ability to gain the power of faith.
 

 
At the time, she simply wanted to make the task more convenient.
 

 
Otherwise, as a young person raised in a family with strong political ideals, she would never have been able to obtain the power of faith.
 

 
The trials at the town-level temple required learning magic, something Zhao Zhao had no problem with—she learned it very quickly.
 

 
After learning magic, the next step was to assist the instructor in killing dark creatures, which wasn’t difficult either.
 

 
Her repeated excellent performances made Zhao Zhao a key candidate for further development, and her efficiency in completing tasks was top-notch.
 

 
After passing the basic tests, the saintess would be presented with a snow-white magical blindfold by the local temple’s priest, which had delicate lace edges. From then on, she could only perceive the outside world through the lens of her faith in the God of Light.
 

 
That was a very special experience.
 

 
Many young saintesses fell and got injured while walking, but Zhao Zhao adapted well. After all, one reason was that she "deeply trusted" the guidance of the God of Light, and the other reason was, wasn’t this basically an infrared thermal scanner?
 

 
The saintess tasks assigned to her were unexpectedly simple, resembling beginner quests in an online game. Accompanying the instructor to hunt dark creatures was thrilling, but most of the time, she just accompanied vehicles transporting goods. The containers were covered with cloth, and occasionally, eerie, rasping sounds could be heard from inside.
 

 
The instructor said they were dark creatures.
 

 
The appearance of dark creatures would be distorted when sensed, and the saintess would only feel how hideous they were.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao rode in a carriage to a larger temple, the trials she faced became even stranger.
 

 
Main Quest 3: Temple Trial – Cleanse the Bodies of Dark Creatures
 

 
Dark creatures also had magic cores, which, when refined, could be turned into magical potions, useful in many ways. However, before refinement, they needed to be purified, and having the saintess cleanse their corrupt bodies was one of the essential processes.
 

 
Main Quest 4: Temple Trial – Teach the New Saintesses
 

 
The saintess candidates all came from orphaned girls across the continent.
 

 
At the time, the identity Zhao Zhao took on, aside from her beauty and relatively high magical talent, was that of someone who could barely afford a meal. If not for the temple taking her in, the legal protections for orphans and widows were very limited, and surviving outside was a major issue.
 

 
Those young saintesses were in the same situation Zhao Zhao had been in before.
 

 
To eat well, sleep well, and be protected, they could only do their best to complete the trials.
 

 
With the blindfold on, Zhao Zhao only knew their height and weight, unable to see the contours of their faces. Among the first group of girls she was in charge of, there was a younger sister who loved to sing, and she liked to touch Zhao Zhao's blindfold, which made her eyelids itch. Guna enjoyed humming her own tunes, and perhaps because of her creativity and imagination, she was a bit difficult to manage.
 

 
Everyone firmly believed in the God of Light and the temple. To carry out her tasks, Zhao Zhao also followed suit and brainwashed herself, but part of her still thought like a modern person. She felt something was wrong, though her “doubt” was modified through code and beautified into—
 

 
She suspected that the temple was not truly faithful to the God of Light, nor was it fully practicing the teachings of the God of Light.
 

 
Zhao Zhao began to collect evidence.
 

 
One of the pieces of evidence that confirmed her suspicion was when the system issued a side mission the moment she began to have doubts.
 

 
Side Quest 1: Strange Sounds in the Priest's Room
 

 
Quest Description: The priest of the Jiadoluo Temple trusts you greatly and often assigns you trivial paperwork. You have the privilege and honor of moving freely around the temple. Today, due to your curiosity, you secretly pocketed some documents to carry with you so that, even if you were discovered while searching the temple at midnight, you would have a good excuse to explain—simply that you were trying to return the documents to the priest! With this in mind, you overheard strange sounds outside the priest's room, similar to the eerie noises heard from the cargo containers carrying dark creatures.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Quest Description: In the class you teach, there are five little girls. Four of them passed the trial, while one was eliminated for misbehaving. No one cares about what happened to the failed girl. You try asking Sister Cheng in the temple, and she tells you that the unqualified girls will return to their original places and will no longer be under the guidance of the God of Light. The other successful saintesses are afraid of returning to a life of hunger and cold, so they have become more eager to study.
 

 
Because of your favored status, your room is stocked with plenty of dry food and snacks. Even though the temple can't keep the singing girl, you want to give her some supplies before she is kicked out, to help her survive until she can find a job in the town.
 

 
You couldn’t find her.
 

 
No one talks about the eliminated saintess Guna anymore, and the system didn’t punish you for failing to complete the side quest. The quest is still marked as "In Progress." You guess that this means she’s still alive after being kicked out of the temple; otherwise, the quest would have been marked as "Failed" due to the girl’s death.
 

 
Perhaps this is the best news, you think optimistically.
 

 
---
 

 
The annual Festival of Light is approaching.
 

 
This year is especially different.
 

 
The previous saintess died as a martyr in battle against the dark creatures, so this year, during the Festival of Light, the Pope will select a true saintess, who will be worshipped by all the people. The chosen saintess will reside in the Holy Temple of Light in the imperial capital and will have the privilege of meeting the emperor without kneeling.
 

 
Since only the followers of the God of Light can fight the dark creatures, the empire's royal power is completely subordinated to the church’s authority.
 

 
If the king is not devout enough, or if something displeases the Pope, the defense of the empire will be in jeopardy.
 

 
During the Festival of Light, the Pope will symbolically kill a dark creature.
 

 
This dark creature, used for show, will have already been "prepared" before the event, weakened to the point of near death to ensure there are no casualties.
 

 
Zhao Zhao is the highly anticipated seed candidate.
 

 
And she also felt that once she took the saintess throne and got close to the core of the church’s power, all her doubts would be resolved.
 

 
Main Quest 5: The Eve of the Festival of Light
 

 
You are assigned to cleanse the sacrificial offering.
 

 
The dark creatures have their own unique language, which sounds like meaningless raspy growls to humans. Their physical composition is also very strange. By touch, you sense a body similar to that of a medium-sized dog, bird-like wings, and four legs covered in cold, wet scales.
 

 
There is also a flat face, with pits and depressions.
 

 
When cleaning the captured dark creatures in the past, they were always very noisy, but this one is unusually quiet. It had been roaring angrily, but when you entered the prison cell, it fell silent. You are somewhat surprised, but also relieved that today’s task will be simpler.
 

 
Until, while you are cleaning its body, you hear its hoarse, subdued cries form a familiar melody.
 

 
Its voice is broken, like a shattered wind instrument, and at first, it sounds like the desperate crying of a child.
 

 
Can dark creatures sing?
 

 
You are astonished.
 

 
Then, you stop scrubbing the dark creature’s body.
 

 
Because you suddenly remember something.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Completed
 

 
"You found Guna."
 

 
*
 

 
[Hiss...]
 

 
[The moment I see you, my head hurts.]
 

 
Tong Zhao pressed her head, as a flood of memories poured into her brain, causing a splitting headache.
 

 
When Iya sat down, a human-shaped chair suddenly appeared in the consciousness palace. It was made by four heretics who had harmed innocent girls for their own selfish desires. Even as she sat, she could still see faces filled with pain and regret beneath her: "Take your time to recall, I'm not in a hurry."
 

 
The Dark God, the dark creatures, and the Saintess trials were all a scam created by the church to consolidate its divine power.
 

 
The Dark God had long since left this continent, having been defeated by the Light God.
 

 
However, the reason the church could stand on equal footing with the king and even hold the upper hand was because they fought the Dark God every year... Without the Dark God, the temple would just be a place where people went to pray on Sundays. At that time, the Pope was unwilling to accept this outcome, so he used powerful magic to create the illusion that the Dark God had not left.
 

 
The temple did not need so many Saintesses.
 

 
But the temple needed many, many dark creatures.
 

 
The dark creatures were created using girls with magical talent through the church’s unique synthesis array, no different from when the Dark God was still around, except that they were now artificially made.
 

 
A carefully selected Saintess stands above countless bones. Even though some of the previous Saintesses, who enjoyed the benefits of power, learned the truth, they either collapsed because they had unknowingly aided the evil during their trials or rationalized their actions.
 

 
More than that, they believed in the church wholeheartedly.
 

 
There have been many generations of Saintess trials.
 

 
When Tong Zhao crossed over, it had clearly become something like ‘The Hunger Games’. Not only did it serve as a provider of raw materials for dark creatures, but it also became a grand gamble for some nobles and high-ranking clergy. They would place their bets on a particular Saintess, and if she passed all the trials and ultimately became the true Saintess, the person who placed the bet would gain her virginity.
 

 
Was all of this just for the virginity?
 

 
It was all about the pleasure of desecrating the Saintess.
 

 
The identity of Iya that Tong Zhao crossed into was one of those bets placed by powerful figures.
 

 
Because of Tong Zhao’s extraordinary faith, the church always considered her a deeply brainwashed fool. They trusted her completely and even gave her many opportunities to investigate the truth. As she unraveled the layers of deceit, she witnessed even darker, more brutal and inhumane truths…
 

 
As a female reporter, it takes a great deal of courage to face the darkness of human nature.
 

 
In her previous world, the reporter Shuyi had fallen into depression.
 

 
But in this Western fantasy world, Iya not only observed all of this, but she also discovered that those seemingly simple and ordinary tasks were actually unintentionally helping to perpetuate such atrocities. She was a cog in the entire system of sin. Every Saintess who passed the trials was a sinner.
 

 
The peace and warmth after crossing over were all an illusion.
 

 
The kinder the person, the less they could bear the darkness.
 

 
Iya was so angry that she almost lost control. Her nails dug deeply into her palm. When Guna, who noticed something was wrong, affectionately rubbed her eye mask against her as she usually did in class, the berserk magic shattered part of Iya’s eye structure. Blood poured from her eye sockets, like tears of blood.
 

 
It was her fault.
 

 
She was guilty.
 

 
Iya felt it was her responsibility to eradicate all this evil, even if this idea seemed as insignificant to the authorities as a mayfly shaking a great tree.
 

 
At the same time, the system unlocked the final mission for her in this world.
 

 
"Become the Last Saintess"
 

 
The system’s original intention was for Iya to gather evidence, expose the truth, and overthrow the church.
 

 
Iya felt that wasn’t enough.
 

 
Wasn’t the church in desperate need of dark creatures?
 

 
A fake wouldn’t do. It had to be real.
 

 
Inside her consciousness palace, Tong Zhao reminded her:
 
"We have children here, so let’s not bring out such a restricted chair."
 

 
"So troublesome."
 

 
Iya sighed softly.
 

 
The next moment, the human-shaped chair was covered in a layer of black leather, but the outlines of limbs occasionally pushing out from beneath the leather still caused one's sanity to drop.
 

 
"Not only has the Dark God left, but the Light God also gave up on its followers long ago."
 

 
"It’s all a deception the church wove together to maintain its power."
 

 
"Later, I found the legacy of the Dark God before it left."
 

 
Iya spoke as though it were a mere detail.
 

 
In reality, she had to race against time before the coming Light Festival, finding a way to break the deadlock. Half of her belief came from the fact that the system never provided a dead end, and the other half came from overwhelming anger and malice. She didn’t even consider herself to be delivering justice; she just wanted to kill all these sinful heretics, to return the atrocities they committed against the little Saintesses back to them tenfold.
 

 
"I really didn’t do much."
 

 
I just stirred up internal strife within the church, triggered two purges of the old church with the Truth Wars, and ultimately, by gathering the faith power from across the continent, became a new deity.
 

 
During the most crucial period, Iya used her delicate demeanor to deceive the church, and this habit became ingrained in her bones. After becoming the only and last Saintess, the continent was unified and brought peace.
 

 
To punish herself, Saintess Iya’s temple was not luxurious. It was said that there were no holy servants attending her; apart from the Saintess living there, the temple was just a dilapidated and crumbling building. Travelers who accidentally entered the temple said that the absence of holy servants was a lie. They met a weak and timid blind girl, who, despite her fragility, provided them with food to stave off hunger and a place to rest.
 

 
He wanted to meet the Saintess.
 

 
But just mentioning her name made the servant girl tremble with fear.
 

 
It seems the Saintess was indeed as brutal and powerful as the rumors suggested!
 

 
Iya had stayed in the western fantasy world for so long that she almost forgot she was only there for a mission. She didn’t like the system, and she didn’t really like herself either. To this day, she couldn’t forgive herself for noticing so late...
 

 
She knew that even if she had realized earlier, she might not have been able to make a change quickly.
 

 
With the legacy of the Dark God, her divine power grew stronger, but so did the impulse to commit evil. After maintaining a century of peace on the continent, she chose to end her life and left that plane.
 

 
Iya also inherited Tong Zhao's memories from that time.
 

 
She furrowed her brows in distress: "I’m afraid I can’t be of any help."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I suggest you be honest with yourself."
 

 
"Alright," she replied.
 

 
Iya propped up her long, slender, and beautiful legs, and with one foot, she stomped down on one of the restless chair components, silencing its movements. Her tone was lazy:
 

 
"Why should I help you? The world is better off destroyed. Just lock me up again."
 

 
"Once you're released, there's no locking you back in. Your destructive desires will affect me, including the mental imprint left on my soul from the Dark God's legacy. You must commit evil at certain times each year; you must harm living beings."
 

 
Iya said nothing.
 

 
At that time, her solution was to harm the worst of the evil-doers. When the old heretics had been mostly purged, there was no one left to kill in order to complete her mission.
 

 
So, what was she supposed to do?
 

 
Where should all that overwhelming malice go?
 

 
The powerful and violent Saintess chose to point the sword at herself, to torture herself in order to atone.
 

 
This was the only self-destructive aspect of Tong Zhao’s personality.
 

 
"I can take on some villain roles for you, so you don't have to hurt yourself anymore," Tong Zhao said. "It's not the same world anymore."
 

 
"I know."
 

 
The lace blindfold covered Iya’s eyes, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see her expression.
 

 
But their feelings were impossible to hide from each other.
 

 
They were silent for a long time.
 

 
Iya slightly curled her pale lips, bringing up everything that both personalities knew, but had never spoken aloud:
 

 
"Are you trying to convince me to forgive myself? Haven’t you always blamed yourself for not realizing that Xu Zhu and her mother were a pair of scum, always thinking it was your fault your mother died? That’s why, in every world you’ve traveled through, you’ve tried so hard not to make mistakes. The person who’s most cruel to you is yourself, the one who draws the line with others is you."
 

 
For those without boundaries, forgiving oneself is a simple matter.
 

 
Even if they commit murder, arson, or force others into prostitution, they have their own logic to absolve themselves.
 

 
But for pure, gentle people…
 

 
Overcoming oneself is, in fact, the hardest challenge.
 

 
The moment for self-reflection always comes without warning, and suddenly "yourself" exposes all your secrets. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.
 

 
Despite the embarrassment, there was also a sense of relief.
 

 
"You're right,"
 

 
Tong Zhao looked directly at her, recalling every version of herself in each world, the faces that were similar yet slightly different, the varying thoughts and personalities: "So, I'm slowly remembering every version of myself from each world, trying to forgive myself."
 

 
Iya turned her face away.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked over and wrapped her arms around her, and Iya didn’t push her away.
 

 
"I have to admit, one of the reasons I’m letting you out now is because I was previously afraid to face the mistakes I’ve made."
 

 
The Saintess didn’t hold back: "Little useless thing."
 

 
"Saintess, hug the little useless thing."
 

 
Iya snorted coldly and pressed her into her embrace:
 

 
"I need to occasionally commit evil in the holographic footage. Don’t try to cling to me for no reason."
# Chapter127
After the edited version of "Baby Chaos" aired, it sparked a wave on Weibo.
 

 
What kind of wave?
 

 
Fans imagined what their favorite idols would be like as a child on a variety show, and celebrities flooded the platform posting their childhood photos, blatantly riding on the coattails of the hype. However, the attention they brought ended up reflecting back on the "Baby Chaos" show itself, expanding the reach of the show. In the end, more people ended up benefiting from the increased attention.
 

 
Among those benefiting the most were Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang.
 

 
Although Jiang Dang telling ghost stories to kids sparked some controversy, many people were surprised by his attention to detail in caring for the tired little Zhao Zai. It turned out that he had some surprisingly humanistic qualities—there were even some netizens who took the opposite view, saying, "You guys are exaggerating and demonizing this male singer! He’s just a bit quirky, how is he a psychopath?"
 

 
Whether Jiang Dang was a normal person or mentally unstable was the subject of much debate.
 

 
The entertainment industry is a dream-making business, and questioning the authenticity of dreams is as futile as boiling a crane or burning a zither.
 

 
After the variety show filming ended, Jiang Dang threw himself into preparations for his national tour concert.
 

 
The first stop of the presale sold out in an unprecedented frenzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao wished him well through WeChat, but due to her work commitments, it was unlikely that she would attend his concert.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "You’re rejecting me, I know."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Can I sing one more song for you?"
 

 
Many people, including Jiang Dang’s assistants, thought he was acting a bit abnormal.
 

 
But in Tong Zhao’s eyes, Jiang Dang just retained the sharpness of a child towards the world—impulsive, spontaneous, with an artistic and epic kind of carefree attitude. Even his sadness was poetic. After a brief pause, he added: "Actually, I meant to ask: Can I sing one more song for you? I might sing for quite a while, so you can do other things while keeping the speaker on."
 

 
Jiang Dang's concert sold out like crazy, and tickets became hard to get.
 

 
It wasn't just his female fans; many people were drawn in because some of his songs were incredibly popular, so much so that no one could resist humming along to them. Many people who went to the concert filmed it and posted it on Douyin, and inviting someone along to watch was also a good choice.
 

 
A lot of people wanted to hear him sing, and often on his Weibo posts, there would be requests for him to cover certain songs.
 

 
Jiang Dang, depending on his mood, would sometimes fulfill his fans' wishes.
 

 
And at this moment, he hoped that someone would be willing to listen to him sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao directly called him.
 

 
As expected, Jiang Dang sang for a long time. She sat on the newly installed swing chair at home, gently rocking as she listened to him play and sing love songs, as if it were a private concert just for her. By the time she began to feel a little drowsy, he stopped: "It's getting late, you should go to bed."
 

 
"Mm."
 

 
"Goodnight."
 

 
Tong Zhao, a bit sleepy, took off her over-ear headphones and shifted from the swing chair to lie on the bed, her mind wandering off with all sorts of disconnected thoughts. She was wondering: What exactly is Jiang Dang's emotional intelligence like? At certain moments, he always seemed to intuitively understand what the other person truly needed, knowing which things didn't need to be asked or said, and when it was time to end things.
 

 
Jiang Dang never asked why she rejected him.
 

 
He didn’t even want to improve himself after knowing the reason, just like falling in love with a drifting cloud—trying to touch it was one thing, but missing it was regrettable, yet not something worth obsessing over.
 

 
Even if she said nothing, he knew exactly when she started to feel sleepy.
 

 
After getting under the covers, Tong Zhao reached up and touched her ear.
 

 
Every time Tong Zhao listened to Jiang Dang sing or speak, her ears always felt like they had just had a massage, becoming unusually sensitive.
 

 
Consort Chen: "You must have some feelings for him, right?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "To be honest, it's hard not to feel something."
 

 
There's a reason why he became a big star. Jiang Dang has a particularly strong personal charm, like a whirlpool. Being around him makes her forget all the worldly troubles, and he always manages to surprise her in strange ways.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "If I weren't a celebrity, or if I were a bit more carefree, having a relationship with him might have been an unforgettable, beautiful experience."
 

 
After all, they’re both in the same industry. Their schedules are packed, and neither of them can make time for the other. Falling into a sticky romance would only be a mutual torment.
 

 
Of course, the fact that she could come up with so many reasons to reject him simply meant she didn't like him enough.
 

 
All the personalities respect Tong Zhao's choices; what she likes is what they all love.
 

 
Iya: "This has nothing to do with me."
 

 
Senior Lu: "Hmm."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Then add one more upstairs."
 

 
Tong Zhao wiped her face and quickly pushed this little life incident out of her mind.
 

 
For many people, love is a very important matter. Tong Zhao had no intention of criticizing "love-brains" because, after all, everyone has something they love. As long as it's not evil or harmful, how could there be any distinction in the value of what people love?
 

 
Jiang Dang was like a brilliant, enchanting aurora that passed through her life.
 

 
And she had no intention of holding on to that light.
 

 
In Jiang Dang's heart, she was the same kind of existence.
 

 
---
 

 
(Note: The term "love-brain" refers to someone whose thoughts and actions are overly focused on love, often to the detriment of other aspects of life.)
 

 
After all, she herself had many things she couldn't figure out, and she had to take it slow.
 

 
Aside from her entanglement with love, Zeshan's team, led by Tong Zhao over the past six months, had already developed into a mature company. While its size still couldn't compare to the family businesses of their parents' generation, it had become a force not to be underestimated. The legend of the "golden touch" continued to grow.
 

 
Even with a venture capital company, making money isn’t just about picking the right projects and waiting for the returns.
 

 
Choosing projects, negotiating details, periodically overseeing them, reviewing reports, adjusting strategies...
 

 
These details were all things Tong Zhao couldn’t control individually, nor did she have the time to.
 

 
She could only teach her team, and then let them lead the company. Zeshan’s path to success, and its growing success, was closely tied to Wei Zekai’s involvement. His investment sense might still need work, but he had a talent for managing and handling details. As long as Tong Zhao gave him some direction, he could make several times the return.
 

 
Isn’t this life fulfilling?
 

 
Tong Zhao was very satisfied.
 

 
After resting for more than half a month, she finally announced her collaboration with Shi Qianqiu, to the eager anticipation of many directors and producers.
 

 
As for the industry's reaction, there were people who were annoyed by Shi Qianqiu and others who were annoyed by Tong Zhao. While cursing and grumbling, they also kept an ear out for their movements and updates, afraid of crossing paths. If the two were working on the same subject matter, forget it—either they’d have to release earlier or later.
 

 
Delaying was a good option.
 

 
While releasing a similar project at the same time wasn’t ideal, if there was a blockbuster of the same genre released earlier, the one that followed could still ride the wave of excitement when it ended.
 

 
The netizens’ opinions were more direct and simple—
 

 
[I'm crying. As a fan of the "Dang Zhao" CP, after the airing of ‘Baby Chaos’, there's no more sugar for me, but now Shi Zhao has an after-show??]
 

 
[They’re true love, I’m sold.]
 

 
[Wasn't Tong Zhao nearly invisible in the media recently? Did they secretly go on a date?]
 

 
The discussion became very heated.
 

 
During her break, the only people Tong Zhao hung out with were the second-generation heirs. Their outings were all private, membership-only, and paparazzi couldn’t catch her. Even if they managed to snap a picture of her chauffeur-driven car, that was as good as seeing her in person. However, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as a completely secret wall. Some netizens managed to release two photos of Tong Zhao shopping with another young woman. Someone commented, “What kind of family do you have to be from to be able to be a sister with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
It was later uncovered that the girl was the daughter of a coal magnate, and she was also a member of Zeshan.
 

 
These two photos proved that Tong Zhao was in China during her break.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He was easy to find. He didn’t treat himself like a celebrity, and even if he didn’t post on Weibo, anyone who was interested could still dig up information about his whereabouts. He had just surfed in Hawaii, then went to see glaciers, skied in Hokkaido, tried bungee jumping, cave diving, and wingsuit flying—he was living dangerously and carefree.
 

 
The two had completely different vacation styles. Netizens who were fans of the "Shi Zhao" CP were told to wake up.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t listening to reason.
 

 
As long as they were both on break at the same time, don’t ask, just assume they’ve gotten their marriage certificate.
 

 
This was a tabloid snippet, but what netizens were mainly discussing was what kind of movie Tong Zhao’s next project would be, and whether she would be collaborating with Shi Qianqiu. If the budget wasn’t a problem, would there be a male lead? Or would it be Han Zhi again?
 

 
Regarding the new movie, Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from his vacation, quickly clarified some rumors.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v:
 

 
The male lead for the new movie is not Han Zhi. It will most likely be a new actor.
 

 
It will be a brand-new version of Tong Zhao that you haven’t seen before.
 

 
No romance, just because a man and a woman are together doesn’t mean it’s love, right? That’s too cliché. When we’re collaborating on investments worth billions, gender doesn’t matter anymore in my heart. I just hope our next film turns out well.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s Weibo post was impressive, each line packed with a new revelation.
 

 
A brand-new version of Tong Zhao—netizens were puzzled, what kind of new version could she possibly have? Is she just going to change her image for every film? The third line clarifying there’s no romance wasn’t the key point anymore. After all, if they really were in a relationship, there’d be no need to hide it. If they kept insisting there’s nothing going on, it’s probably true. But Shi Qianqiu explicitly stated that the new movie was a commercial collaboration between him and Tong Zhao, involving investments of billions.
 

 
[Oh wow, this is heading for a big production!]
 

 
[Spending billions on a big movie and casting a newcomer as the male lead—that’s some serious boldness.]
 

 
[You’re dumb, does the male lead really matter when the movie has Tong Zhao? He’s not important, just a decoration. Wait and see, my Zhao will crush everything.]
 

 
Even those who weren’t Tong Zhao’s fans mostly held the stereotype that "Tong Zhao should always be at the center." With her shining like the brightest moon, other stars just seem to fade into the background.
 

 
So...
 

 
What kind of movie are Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao, this box-office-winning pair, preparing to make?
 

 
The industry couldn’t sit still.
 

 
If they couldn’t get to Tong Zhao, they’d try her agent. If they couldn’t find her agent, they’d start asking people who knew her—until even Jiang Dang relayed to Tong Zhao: [A lot of people are asking me if I can recommend them to you.]
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao was truly shocked.
 

 
After all, asking Jiang Dang for help was always risky.
 

 
Sometimes, he doesn’t listen to anyone or do what he’s supposed to.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed and asked him how those people had phrased it.
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment.
 

 
They had said a lot to him, speaking very humbly, putting on a very low profile. It seemed they were willing to take even a small, inconsequential role, though of course, a role with some screen time would be preferable.
 

 
[They said they... ]
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment again: [They want a small, supporting role.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [......]
 

 
So they put in a lot of effort just to ask for a small role?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t believe it, but it didn’t matter to her anymore. [Did you take any benefits from them? If you did, I can arrange a screen test for them.]
 

 
Jiang Dang sent a little cat shaking its head emoji.
 

 
Jiang Dang: [I told them... If such an opportunity comes up, I’ll just take it myself.]
 

 
He wasn't stupid.
# Chapter128
At Zeshan, it was Tong Zhao who led her team in business.
 

 
But when it came to investing in films, it was Shi Qianqiu who guided Tong Zhao. He meticulously taught her every intricate detail of the process involved in producing holographic films. This investment was different from the low-cost, high-return "Neverland Girl." It had a higher standard, requiring more attention to detail.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu discovered that even though Tong Zhao had already established herself as a box-office queen in the film industry, she was still very humble and eager to learn in unfamiliar areas. Her learning ability was exceptionally strong, making her a very pleasant student to teach.
 

 
However, having a strong learning ability was one thing.
 

 
What truly surprised Shi Qianqiu, though, was something else.
 

 
...
 

 
"I didn’t expect your imagination to be so rich."
 

 
Using the latest cutting-edge consciousness scanning technology, the professional team was able to transform the images from Tong Zhao's mind into holographic recordings. This effectively gave birth to the prototype of a new world: "I’ve seen plenty of fantasy films, but the world you imagine is quite... disturbing."
 

 
Tong Zhao silently stared at him.
 

 
It was as if she had just given a sarcastic teammate a question mark in a game.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu met her gaze calmly: "Isn’t it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't refute.
 

 
A month ago, it was... Iya, Sister Iya.
 

 
Iya: "It's Iya.”
 

 
Iya: "Don’t call me randomly, and no 'sister' either."
 

 
When Iya woke up, she had been searching for the right kind of antagonist. In the end, none of the scripts on the market suited her taste—she wanted a charming villain, one who could still captivate the audience even while committing evil deeds. After all, aren't movies and novels meant to provide enjoyment? In romance novels, the domineering CEO's forced love makes some readers swoon, and the obsessive, sickly types are all the rage. But if you meet such people in real life, the only thing you can say is "Run!"
 

 
The scripts that Tong Zhao flipped through generally had two types of villains:
 

 
1. The tool character.
 
2. The villain with a tragic backstory, inherently good at heart.
 

 
Iya wasn’t interested in the second type, claiming it went against the doctrine.
 

 
Iya: "Every person I kill when I’m in a frenzy, I hate them. This is the price I pay for accepting the Dark God's inheritance. The system has tried to remove it, but it only reduced the frequency of the episodes."
 

 
At first, she killed former cult members who had done many evil deeds, and Iya naturally hated them.
 

 
Later, however, she harmed herself.
 

 
She truly hated not noticing the truth of the Church sooner, and every moment when she failed to intervene in time.
 

 
So, the villain she would portray had to be someone who genuinely wanted to do evil—no tragic backstory, no redemption. Iya didn’t care whether the audience would hate the character. After all, it was just a performance; it wouldn't affect the actress personally. Tong Zhao had already played many likable, positive roles, but playing a major villain so early in her career needed more careful consideration.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a long time before finally going to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
She expressed all her requirements for the villain and then, slyly added, "I hope the audience will like her.”
 

 
This was a requirement that Iya hadn't mentioned.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao hoped the audience would like her.
 

 
The two of them hit it off right away. To discuss this matter, Shi Qianqiu had several video conferences with her. Each time, the background was different. Sometimes it was a sunny beach with his skin reddened by the sun, other times it was a freezing snow-covered landscape, and once, during a discussion about the character's details, the aurora lit up the sky behind him.
 

 
It was a sight that made people envious.
 

 
After several video meetings, Director Shi finally decided to focus and return home. He invited Tong Zhao to stay in one of his studios for about a week—along with his team. Their daily schedule consisted of brainstorming and refining the existing ideas.
 

 
What they ultimately settled on was a high-budget, special effects blockbuster.
 

 
A fantasy-themed film.
 

 
The worldview was provided by Tong Zhao, and Shi Qianqiu refined it.
 

 
They discussed whether to make it more complex or simpler.
 

 
Most big-budget films on the market are aimed at creating IP, so they naturally tend to be more complex. This way, it sets up potential sequels and the sale of merchandise. Additionally, the more complex the world-building, the more different it is from reality, making it easier for the audience to immerse themselves and believe that this is another world.
 

 
After seeing the world that Tong Zhao had "imagined," Shi Qianqiu chose the latter.
 

 
...
 

 
"The world you imagined has a fully developed system of evil."
 

 
"Under the banner of the God of Light, all the buildings appear luxurious and beautiful at first glance, even the poorest commoners value ritual. But as the story progresses, it unveils the dark and gloomy side of the world.”
 

 
"The world you've imagined has a unique and unified aesthetic, there’s no need to come up with a bunch of odd names to create a sense of mystery... I’ve always believed that those hard-to-remember names only serve to make it more difficult for the audience to write reviews, while creating a sense of superiority among the fanbase, making it a niche code of communication for this small circle."
 

 
"There’s really no need for that."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu set the tone for the new movie: "I want it to be a film where the audience can easily immerse themselves. When they think it's just a special effects action movie, the plot takes an unexpected turn and makes them question their life choices."
 

 
After hearing Shi Qianqiu’s grand theories, Tong Zhao gave him a blank stare.
 

 
Compared to Shi Qianqiu, even Jiang Dang could be described as cute.
 

 
There were so many people vying for a chance to audition that the team was overwhelmed. After much anticipation from the entire industry, the main cast was finally confirmed. When it came to casting, Tong Zhao didn’t give much input—after all, Shi Qianqiu was the one who had years of experience in selecting the right subconscious talents from auditions. One particularly strong statement from him was—
 

 
"I saw your potential before you even auditioned. Tell me, is it because my judgment is impeccable, or because you're just that impressive?"
 

 
Faced with the confident words of the great director Shi, Tong Zhao’s mood was a bit complicated. She felt a little like punching him.
 

 
What should she do if her own director was so punchable?
 

 
Waiting online, getting a bit urgent.
 

 
The production team’s WeChat group was one that Shi Qianqiu had added her to.
 

 
She usually kept quiet with strangers, so even though she was added, she wouldn’t have spoken unless necessary. However, once her name appeared, the group immediately exploded with messages welcoming her, especially from the male lead, Sun Sa.
 

 
Sun Sa: [Welcome, Sister Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
Sun Sa: [Sister Xiao Zhao, I'm your fan! Let's team up sometime! Please let me hug your thigh and rank up! I really love the role of the Imperial Concubine you played, and your little Zhao Zai, they're so cute. I’ve always dreamed of working with you. I can't believe my dream is finally coming true!]
 

 
Yu Zeqi: [Sister Xiao Zhao, don’t listen to him, he’s a dad fan, just wants to take advantage of you /dog head.]
 

 
Sun Sa, who wouldn’t turn 20 for another three months and was still attending film school, was over the moon after getting this huge opportunity. He was so excited, it almost felt like he was about to burst with happiness. His youthful enthusiasm was evident in his words, which made Shi Qianqiu a little annoyed and even more interested in tormenting him in the movie.
 

 
In the era of instinctual cinema, as long as the subconscious fit, it could even outweigh the drawbacks of inexperience.
 

 
After seeing Sun Sa, Tong Zhao understood why Shi Qianqiu had chosen him.
 

 
Other established actors just wouldn’t work.
 

 
They weren't as naive as him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Actually, if you’re looking for someone who’s both naive and handsome, I just thought of someone."
 

 
In the studio, Shi Qianqiu was fiddling with equipment. When he heard this, he glanced up at her: "Your little brat?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Yes, but I’m not recommending him, I just suddenly thought of him."
 

 
"I know, I’ve thought about him. He’s quite handsome, and his personality makes me want to bully him," only those particularly close to Shi Qianqiu knew that when he evaluated an actor’s potential, sometimes his criteria included whether he wanted to bully them in the film: "You two are too close, I’m worried it’ll affect his subconscious performance."
 

 
"Oh.”
 

 
Sun Sa had no idea that the director he admired so much, Shi Qianqiu, was secretly plotting ways to make him suffer in the holographic film. He was so excited that he couldn’t sleep well for three days. Everyone on his friend list knew by now that he had joined Shi Qianqiu’s new project and was even working with Tong Zhao. It was the opportunity of a lifetime!
 

 
This excitement lasted until he officially joined the crew and prepared to start filming.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t give the actors any scripts, claiming, "You’ll understand once you’re in."
 

 
Sun Sa didn’t suspect anything.
 

 
What bad intentions could Director Shi possibly have? After all, he was Sun Sa’s most respected idol!
 

 
And so, he happily climbed into the holographic filming pod.
 

 
---
 

 
Meanwhile, in her own holographic filming pod, Tong Zhao nervously ceded control to the alter personality, Iya. After weeks of preparation, Iya had been struggling to suppress her destructive urges. Her overwhelming desire for chaos had started to bleed into Tong Zhao's primary personality, to the point where even Tong Zhao herself found it hard to sleep.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Tong Zhao's sleek, graceful figure could often be seen sprawled over a couch, lightly gasping for breath like a fish out of water.
 

 
Iya: [I’m fine.]
 

 
Her tone carried the full weight of "I'm so done—let the world burn."
 

 
When the machinery began to operate, all the actors’ consciousnesses gradually blurred, as though being pulled into the depths of an endless ocean.
 

 
---
 

 
Cast List:
 

 
- Sun Sa as Dion
 

 
- Tong Zhao as Iya
 

 
- Yu Zeqi as Norlens
 

 
...followed by a long list of other actors.
 

 
---
 

 
The story is set in a fictional world on the continent of Garan.
 

 
Fantasy films often evoke images of Western elements like wizards and knights, so having Eastern actors portray such characters might feel somewhat out of place. But would Shi Qianqiu be the type of person to care about such things? He believed that fiction is fiction—it isn't Eastern nor Western. It's a story that unfolds in another dimension.
 

 
The protagonist, Dion, is an unremarkable young noble.
 

 
Though he is called a noble, it really just means he’s a bit wealthier than most people, with a relatively "noble" family name. Because of his distant relation to the main branch, he hasn't enjoyed much of the extravagant, decadent life of nobility. He’s never had to worry about basic needs, though. He only stands out because he has an exceptionally handsome face, which often makes him the target of jealousy from the main house's aristocrats.
 

 
Despite this, it has not affected his cheerful disposition and strong sense of justice.
 

 
Dion worships the God of Light.
 

 
His affinity with the God of Light is extremely high, and his faith is far stronger than his peers’.
 

 
Through Dion’s perspective, the world and background are lightly introduced.
 

 
Neither is particularly complex.
 

 
The more complicated a world is, the easier it is to find its flaws and contradictions. So, Shi Qianqiu chose the opposite approach: rather than complicating things, he used the visual spectacles created from Tong Zhao’s imagination to pull the audience into another world...
 

 
This December, the once-in-a-decade Red Moon will descend.
 

 
When the Red Moon appears, it marks the peak of the Dark God’s power. The sky will be covered with the blood-red moon, and dark creatures will wreak havoc across the entire continent of Garan. The followers of the God of Light will fight relentlessly to protect the capital.
 

 
This is a tradition in the capital, and Dion believes in it firmly.
 

 
He also hopes to join the ranks of the Holy Knights.
 

 
Moreover, the Pope has prophesied that this year’s Red Moon will be far more severe than previous ones...
 

 
Due to his excellent performance, Dion passes some smaller trials and earns the qualification to become a Holy Knight—
 

 
This part of the story progresses very quickly. The trials are challenging but not overly difficult. If the crew hadn’t already known what happens later in the script, they might’ve questioned whether these plot points were even written by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, Shi Qianqiu... would he really come up with problems that could be solved so easily?
 

 
He’s too much of a people pleaser!
 

 
This kind of plot is just not his style!
 

 
It feels off.
 

 
The beginning of the film's shoot felt like a fairy tale, with stunning architecture and an atmosphere as sacred as the sound of Brahman. Even though the name "God of Light" seemed a bit casually chosen, under the modelers' atmospheric design, the viewers could still feel the devotion of each character. The people of this continent deeply trusted the church and the God of Light...
 

 
This was, of course, intentional.
 

 
Because Shi Qianqiu had implanted faith commands into the subconscious minds of the extras. There was no need for any acting—the extras, in every moment of the holographic shoot, were devout followers, as if brainwashed. They never questioned the reality of the God of Light, and praying was as natural as eating, drinking, or using the restroom—it was an everyday task, something they did without thinking.
 

 
Through this method, the "brainwashed" effect that Tong Zhao wanted was achieved.
 

 
When the lighting and music were bright and cheerful, the atmosphere felt like a fairy tale.
 

 
The main plot of the film revolves around the upcoming arrival of the Red Moon. The entire nation is preparing for the onslaught of dark creatures. The Pope suggests that if they can travel deep into the Darkflower Forest and destroy one of the Dark God’s remaining temples, the strength of the dark creatures that are born will be reduced...
 

 
The Darkflower Forest is home to many dark creatures, making it extremely dangerous.
 

 
Due to the Dark God's barrier, anyone with weak faith who enters will be mentally deceived. Only those who pass certain trials can enter, and the number of people allowed is limited. If too many people go, the self-protecting mechanism of the Darkflower Forest will be triggered, and the army will be forcefully expelled—
 

 
So the question arises: If the barrier is so powerful, why not just stay in the capital?
 

 
Why go to the Darkflower Forest as a suicide soldier? Even if they were willing, their families wouldn’t permit it.
 

 
"During the auditions, many of the actors didn’t have the courage in their subconscious."
 

 
A modeler, watching the filming from backstage, complained, “Actually, all Director Shi needs to do is reduce the fear factor of the Darkflower Forest in their minds. It's all adjustable."
 

 
The assistant director shook his head in disagreement. "Someone like Sun Sa, who knows there's a tiger on the mountain but is so easily swayed by justice that he walks straight into the tiger's den, is exactly the type Director Shi likes!"
 

 
"You call Sun Sa a fool?"
 

 
"I mean he's a hero, a brave soul."
 

 
"I clearly heard you just say..."
 

 
"No, you didn't."
 

 
Though Sun Sa wasn’t a big celebrity with a powerful background, the assistant director felt a bit awkward for blurting that out and realized it was impolite.
 

 
However, as the director in charge of the entire production, Shi Qianqiu still sat in his director’s chair, biting into a red apple. He stared at the shooting screen, lost in thought, seemingly unaware of their casual conversation.
 

 
Meanwhile, the filming progressed to the part where Sun Sa’s character, Dion, took on the nearly suicidal mission.
 

 
“Hahahahaha!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu took a bite of half an apple and slapped his thigh, “Fool!”
 

 
Within that burst of laughter, there was a hint of affection.
 

 
“...”
 

 
The other staff members fell silent.
 

 
Now, back to the movie.
 

 
Another actor, Yu Zeqi, playing Norence, also passed the test. Though she wasn’t as brave as Sun Sa, under the background setup, she had her own reasons for going—if she succeeded in the mission, even if she didn’t survive, her family would receive a large amount of compensation. Moreover, her brother had died in the Darkflower Forest, and she was determined to find out what kind of place it really was.
 

 
With the knights and mages in place, the church finally assigned them a red-robed saintess.
 

 
The saintess specialized in healing and purification magic.
 

 
It was said that this saintess came from a faraway village, and after going through numerous trials, she had finally made it to the capital’s temple. However, due to some misdeed, she had been marginalized. Though she wasn’t outright eliminated, she was still assigned to a mission like this, to the Darkflower Forest...
 

 
It was almost as if they were sending her to her death.
 

 
...
 

 
“Hey, what do you think the saintess will be like?”
 

 
Norence was getting a bit irritated thinking about how her "death day" was approaching. She was skilled with water magic, and if it weren’t for the urgent need for money at home to treat an illness, she wouldn’t have come on this trip. She was hoping to see a powerful saintess who could increase their team’s chances of survival.
 

 
“I don’t know.”
 

 
Dion shook his head.
 

 
Saintesses rarely appeared outside the temple, and they would never casually converse with strange men. He had only seen the saintess from a distance during the Light Festival.
 

 
The one he saw back then was a true saintess.
 

 
The one assigned to them, at best, could only be considered a contender for the position of saintess.
 

 
“Don’t you fear death?” Norence asked irritably.
 

 
“Of course I fear it, but…”
 

 
Dion, the "fool," placed his hand on the knight’s sword at his waist and solemnly declared, “To defend the glory of the Light God, it is our duty!”
 

 
Norence was speechless.
 

 
Off-camera, Shi Qianqiu was laughing so hard that he couldn’t even eat his apple anymore.
 

 
Others were puzzled.
 

 
Sun Sa was handsome, the kind of handsome with sharp brows and bright eyes, the youthful, composed type. So when he said these words, it came from a deep sense of duty. Where’s the joke in that? After laughing, Shi Qianqiu instructed the stage crew, "Make a note of this. He needs a fitting background music; without it, this line sounds too cringey."
 

 
Norence was at a loss for words for a moment when the church’s clergy appeared with the saintess.
 

 
When it was time for Tong Zhao to make her entrance, Shi Qianqiu put down his apple and didn’t miss a single frame. He was clearly excited, like an artisan who had just gotten the perfect materials…
 

 
Iya was a very special character.
 

 
Even Shi Qianqiu had reservations about whether Tong Zhao’s subconscious could deliver the performance he wanted.
 

 
The assistant director even directly said he didn’t think Tong Zhao was suitable.
 

 
With such a high investment, they should have chosen a safer option. However, taking a step back, even if Tong Zhao didn’t portray Iya the way they originally intended, it would be entirely possible to adjust the script for her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s box office draw was undeniable—changing the script would be nothing.
 

 
When the clergy brought the saintess onto the set, Norence’s eyes filled with disappointment.
 

 
The young girl seemed very young, frail as if a gust of wind could knock her over. Her eyes were covered. Even without seeing her expression, one could sense her timid, fearful nature from her body language. She kept her head down, as if she feared the presence of the two others.
 

 
“…My name is Iya.”
 

 
…
 

 
This was also the reason the assistant director didn’t think Tong Zhao could pull off Iya.
 

 
He was actually a fan of hers, a big fan.
 

 
He had recorded ‘One Life Survivor’ and watched it over and over again. A fierce woman who could single-handedly kill twenty enemies—could her subconscious be weak?
 

 
If she wasn’t weak enough, the audience wouldn’t be able to let their guard down.
 

 
And the girl who appeared on screen now was clearly a textbook example of weakness—beautiful but otherwise useless.
# Chapter129
When the filming ended, Sun Sa woke up with a start.
 

 

 

 
He pressed his hand to his chest, and the motion caused a tangle of wires and equipment attached to his body.
 

 

 

 
“Ah... damn…”
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa raised his hand and rubbed his forehead.
 

 

 

 
The stagehand handed him a warm towel to wipe his face.
 

 

 

 
After wiping his face, he did indeed feel better, but a huge sense of emptiness still filled his chest. He had some experience with instinctive films during his school days. Although the length and intensity couldn’t compare to a full-fledged shoot, he at least knew what the feeling was like after filming an instinctive movie.
 

 

 

 
Although his memory hadn’t fully recovered, the experiences from the "dream" remained, about one-tenth of it, with those more susceptible to dream influence feeling it more deeply. From Sun Sa’s past experience, he wasn’t particularly sensitive. Even after going through the trauma of losing his family during filming, he would only feel slightly down afterward. A quick face wash and he could head out to play a murder mystery game with friends, go clubbing, or enjoy a hotpot.
 

 

 

 
But now…
 

 

 

 
The stagehand watched the young, handsome guy, who was now dejected and gloomy, and couldn’t help but ask, “Do you need to apply for psychological counseling?”
 

 

 

 
For large productions like ‘The Iya Myth’, a team doctor was essential.
 

 

 

 
To prevent any psychological issues from arising in the instinctive actors.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, then shook his head. “No, it’s not necessary…”
 

 

 

 
In fact, needing psychological counseling was a very normal demand. But this was Sun Sa’s first time acting in an instinctive film, and he didn’t want others to think he was being too difficult. So after wiping his face, he went back to the dorm room arranged for him by the production team and silently lay down on the bed for a while.
 

 

 

 
He couldn’t sleep.
 

 

 

 
His chest felt tight and heavy.
 

 

 

 
After tossing and turning in bed for a while, Sun Sa went to the automatic vending machine in the hallway to buy cigarettes and a lighter. He had quit smoking for a long time, but today, he felt so frustrated that he couldn’t get through it without a cigarette. He returned to his room, lit up, and smoked one cigarette after another until the entire pack was gone. His throat felt tight and sore.
 

 

 

 
At his worst, Sun Sa’s smoking addiction wasn’t even this bad.
 

 

 

 
Finishing a whole pack in one go made him feel like he was going to throw up. He grabbed some candy provided by the dormitory, chewed it, but it had no taste.
 

 

 

 
He thought for a moment and finally decided to reach out to his manager for help.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [Brother Chen, I’ve finished filming.]
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [I feel worse than eating shit right now.]
 

 

 

 
The manager was shocked but also a little amused. How could anyone describe themselves like that? Still, he patiently comforted him for a while, reassuring him that it would get better once the film was released. Sun Sa had a vague sense that once his memories returned, he would feel even worse than he did now.
 

 

 

 
Brother Chen: [Look on the bright side, once the movie comes out and you become famous, none of this will matter.]
 

 

 

 
Indeed, who doesn’t love fame and fortune?
 

 

 

 
Thinking about the fame and more acting opportunities coming his way, Sun Sa felt a little uplifted.
 

 

 

 
Like many people who ignore their emotional problems, he thought the public would be happy for his wealth and recognition, so he had no reason to be unhappy. He chose to suppress his “sensitive” thoughts and tried to stay on track...
 

 

 

 
---
 

 

 

 
‘The Iya Myth’ has wrapped up filming and editing begins!
 

 

 

 
A large-scale fantasy production, extravagant special effects, an independent worldview, and a powerful collaboration between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu...
 

 

 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu boldly lowered the rental rate of the material code to below 30%, meaning 70% of the code for ‘The Iya Myth’ was custom-built by the production team. This required not only manpower and resources, but also Shi Qianqiu’s confidence in his team’s abilities. If this film becomes a hit, even if he never directs again, just taking on outsourcing projects could earn him sky-high fees!
 

 

 

 
He was taking a huge gamble.
 

 

 

 
Making an instinctive film was always a gamble, and Shi Qianqiu, in particular, was a gambler who loved to bet everything on a single throw.
 

 

 

 
Someone dug up Shi Qianqiu's personal signature:
 

 

 

 
"Gambling is about restraint, low cost is the real indulgence."
 

 

 

 
What does that mean? The logic and phrasing are complete nonsense.
 

 

 

 
A netizen pointed out that he must still be thinking about ‘The Neverland Girl’, which was his lowest-cost film, and this time, with ‘The Iya Myth’, he’s finally getting the chance to shine.
 

 

 

 
[Wow, he truly deserves the title of the man who burns the most money in the film industry.]
 

 

 

 
[Zhao Zhao is probably the woman who makes the most money in the film industry, right?]
 

 

 

 
[If ‘The Iya Myth’ becomes a hit, she’ll probably be the box office queen this year.]
 

 

 

 
[The person above clearly hasn’t been keeping up with the numbers. If ‘The Iya Myth’ doesn’t blow up, she’ll still be the box office queen. If it does blow up, she’s already reserved the spot for the annual champion, ignoring gender. No man can beat her.]
 

 

 

 
Movies with a male lead are more common than those with a female lead — that’s the ceiling for actresses.
 

 

 

 
How many big female-lead films are there in a year? It’s impossible for all of them to be taken by Tong Zhao. But since she’s so good at making money and has connections, she started producing her own films, making them for herself without needing to cater to anyone’s preferences.
 

 

 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was Tong Zhao’s first film as a producer. Entertainment forums had hot posts calculating its cost and profits, and the return on investment was so high that netizens were amazed, lamenting how easy it is to make money in the entertainment industry.
 

 

 

 
Immediately, industry insiders rolled their eyes and replied.
 

 

 

 
They didn’t say much, just posted about this year’s instinctive films that bombed, showing how much they lost.
 

 

 

 
For every flop, it usually takes one and a half successful films to make up for the loss.
 

 

 

 
There will always be winners, but no one wins forever.
 

 

 

 
[But isn’t it true that Tong Zhao has never lost?]
 

 

 

 
[……]
 

 

 

 
[Aren’t we supposed to be discussing Shi Qianqiu here?]
 

 

 

 
[Has he never lost?]
 

 

 

 
The conversation couldn't continue after this, and the post discussing the data ended up turning into a lemon orchard, where people had to admit that some individuals are just born to conquer audiences.
 

 

 

 
There’s no doubt that the core of the discussion about ‘The Iya Myth’ is Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
However, a recent piece of negative news has caused even more heated discussions —
 

 

 

 
“‘The Iya Myth’ male lead Sun Sa suffers from a mental disorder!”
 

 

 

 
The news was exposed by a malicious media outlet known for using various borderline legal tactics to obtain sensational stories. This time, they revealed a wiretapping scandal and traced it back to Sun Sa's secondary Weibo account.
 

 

 

 
When a scandal breaks out, a typical male celebrity's secondary Weibo account might contain sweet messages with a mistress.
 

 

 

 
But what about Sun Sa?
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe (LittleWindNotHappy):
 

 

 

 
I can't let go, I think about her every night. I can’t move on, I can’t get out.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
Why do I have to suffer like this? She really is my ideal type.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
I want to write your name on a cigarette and inhale it into my lungs.
 

 

 

 
Before filming ‘The Iya Myth’, Sun Sa was a typical film school student with no messy girlfriend fanbase. So, this secondary account leak didn’t cause a mass unfollow — after all, he had no fans to begin with. But this heavy-hearted post on Weibo intrigued netizens, sparking curiosity.
 

 

 

 
[Who is this “she”?]
 

 

 

 
[I'm so curious about who made this guy care so much.]
 

 

 

 
[Why call yourself Xiao Feng? Is it because you can't stand up anymore?] 
 

 

 

 
[The person above is just like the car that goes to kindergarten/(dog emoji)] 
 

 

 

 
[Though, that line about inhaling it into the lungs really felt so corny, patting the little brother’s head.] 
 

 

 

 
The ambiguous posts on his secondary Weibo account were unclear, but the leaked wiretap audio cleared up the confusion— 
 

 

 

 
— “I’ve been thinking about Sister Xiao Zhao all day.” 
 

 
— “I really want to go on variety shows to promote, I can’t wait to be in the same frame as her, but I’m also afraid to meet her in person.” 
 

 
— “Because maybe what I like is the character she plays... I wish it wouldn’t end... but if it doesn’t end, it doesn’t really make a difference.” 
 

 
— “I have to take melatonin to fall asleep.” 
 

 

 

 
The audio was very clear. Fortunately, even though he was dealing with emotional issues, Sun Sa still remembered his confidentiality agreement and didn’t reveal the source of his distress. So even though the conversation was wiretapped and leaked, it didn’t spoil the plot of the new film, but it did provide an additional topic for discussion.
 

 

 

 
After the news broke, the ‘The Iya Myth’ team immediately arranged psychological counseling for Sun Sa. 
 

 

 

 
It was then discovered that, despite his agent saying that it would pass, Sun Sa had not only tasted the bitterness of fame, but was still troubled. Because of the deep suppression and his constant denial of his emotional problems, the emotional strain had accumulated to the point of almost festering. Afterward, Sun Sa felt very guilty and apologized profusely to Tong Zhao, who told him to focus on recovering: “This shows how desperately the media wanted news about ‘The Iya Myth’… they’d go to such lengths... It’s not your fault; who could’ve predicted this? But next time you’re filming a holographic movie, make sure to consult with a doctor if needed—emotions are never trivial.”
 

 

 

 
Of course, it wasn’t his fault. 
 

 

 

 
The blame lay with the intrusive paparazzi. 
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao even felt a little sorry. This wasn’t something a newcomer should have to face... he had only just turned twenty, and all of this was because this was her movie. People were willing to go to any lengths to get news related to her. However, considering the rewards he could gain from ‘The Iya Myth’, this small suffering was nothing in comparison. 
 

 

 

 
So, during the meeting, Tong Zhao’s words, which were about to be spoken, reverted to a cold tone:
 

 

 

 
"With ‘The Iya Myth’, both my and Sun Sa's Baidu indexes have been rising rapidly. On the bright side, we’re not without benefits; even if rumors about us circulate, it won’t affect me." From an objective perspective, this was even a win-win type of publicity; the only thing that was harmed was Sun Sa’s mental health—the feeling of his personal privacy being violated made him more uneasy, as he was already struggling with emotional issues: "Now, there are two options: either not clarify the rumors and continue the gossip about me and him..."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao had a mature PR and marketing team, who earned a generous fee each year to handle such public relations crises.
 

 

 

 
As her status rose, her team also began to take her feelings more into consideration.
 

 

 

 
Everyone quietly listened to her decision.
 

 

 

 
"My answer is no. The film's quality is excellent, and there's no need to use this type of news to promote it. That would just play into the paparazzi’s hands. Let’s redirect the focus back to the film itself. We can clarify that Sun Sa is obsessed with the character I play in the movie—he even mentioned it in the audio recording. Outside of the movie, it's not the same thing."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t try to exaggerate her tone.
 

 

 

 
She remained calm and composed, delivering her words decisively, and no one in the room challenged her stance.
 

 

 

 
At the right moment, Shi Qianqiu interjected to ease the atmosphere: "We can create a smoke screen, let the netizens believe that ‘The Iya Myth’ is a particularly sweet romance between the male and female leads."
 

 

 

 
Those who had seen the original film gave him a look of approval. 
 

 

 

 
Such a sharp move, Director Shi!
 

 

 

 
The head of the PR team nodded: "We can arrange that. The data shows that the netizens' attitude is still relatively calm, and the mainstream voice is condemning the media for using wiretapping to get news about a new actor who's only twenty years old. Some fans also don’t want you to choose..."
 

 

 

 
He paused for a moment: "A boyfriend weaker than Xiao Zhao."
 

 

 

 
In Eastern cultures, people tend to subconsciously disapprove of relationships where the woman is stronger than the man.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao gestured to indicate that she no longer wanted to discuss the matter.
 

 

 

 
The team quickly picked up on the hint and steered the conversation back to how to manage the public relations.
 

 

 

 
*
 

 

 

 
The clarification of the rumors about Tong Zhao and Sun Sa happened quickly.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao herself did not speak out, which in itself was a statement— 
 

 

 

 
The matter was trivial, laughably false. Did they really think they could get her to respond by using cheap tactics? Go back and think about whether they even deserved her attention. The PR team then issued a statement through the film’s channels that afternoon. First, they condemned the wiretapping as an invasion of privacy, then mentioned that Sun Sa was actively seeking psychological treatment after the filming, asking everyone to focus on the new movie instead.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa did not appear, but a reporter released a video of him being interviewed outside his building. In the video, the young man looked dejected and visibly worn out, which immediately sparked netizens' sympathy.
 

 

 

 
Soon after, a version of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was released.
 

 

 

 
How touching must the movie be for a handsome young man like him to be so affected by it?
 

 

 

 
The quality of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was top-notch, merely revealing a glimpse of the scenery in the film, but it quickly shifted the focus of the viewers.
 

 

 

 
In the trailer, Sun Sa’s character, Dion, is dressed in a platinum-colored knight's armor, holding Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
The official stills for ‘The Iya Myth’ hadn't been released yet.
 

 

 

 
This was the first time netizens had seen Tong Zhao's look in the new film.
 

 

 

 
In this shot, she slightly lowers her long, elegant neck, her delicate, fair shoulder trembling slightly in the wind, exuding a sense of fragility. When she lifts her head, she reveals her eyes hidden behind a lace eye mask, covering her usual electrifying gaze and making her appear even more vulnerable.
 

 

 

 
["Their mission is to destroy the temple of the Dark God, but Dion secretly vows in his heart as a knight—"]
 

 

 

 
["He must protect the Holy Lady."]
 

 

 

 
Next, the female antagonist Norence's loud shout:
 

 

 

 
["She's just a useless burden who only holds us back! Don’t you understand? We should leave her here—"]
 

 

 

 
Just as the words end, Iya softly pulls on the male lead's sleeve: "Don’t leave me..."
 

 

 

 
This should have seemed very cliché.
 

 

 

 
However, Tong Zhao was simply too beautiful. Watching this scene, netizens, both male and female, couldn’t help but sympathize with the male lead, feeling protective of the delicate beauty. After all, it’s a movie, and the protagonist will always overcome adversity, right? What’s wrong with taking care of the little beauty? Of course, to make it seem like Tong Zhao wasn’t just a burden, the trailer also cleverly included scenes where her character points the way for the team, suggesting that she is actually quite useful.
 

 

 

 
The trailer was packed with information. Netizens only knew that the main team was undertaking a dangerous mission, with Tong Zhao playing the Holy Lady, who possesses healing magic. She is frail, kind, and gentle, earning the approval of the initially hostile female antagonist by protecting her teammates.
 

 

 

 
The trailer ends with Tong Zhao getting injured while protecting the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Blood slowly trickles down from her head, staining her platinum hair and fair face. The male lead, filled with pity and heartache, gently caresses her cheek and kisses her forehead.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
[Isn't this just as intense as ‘Boruto: Naruto Next Generations’?]
 

 

 

 
[What just happened? I feel like I’ve been sweetened. The plot seems a bit simple, but with her looks alone, it’s worth it.]
 

 

 

 
[I thought I was already immune to Tong Zhao’s beauty, but I didn’t expect her to reach new heights in her new movie. Is that platinum-colored hair real? I can totally understand why Sun Sa couldn’t move on after filming, and also, Xiao Sa’s looks are amazing, he really could be in an idol drama.]
 

 

 

 
[You guys only noticed the looks of the leads? Did you forget about the 70% exclusive set codes promoted for ‘The Iya Myth’? These are scenes you can only see in this movie! Several wide shots are so beautiful and luxurious, no wonder they match Shi Qianqiu’s taste; it's absolutely perfect.]
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
The comments are all praises.
 

 

 

 
For a big-budget commercial film like ‘The Iya Myth’, most of the audience comes to enjoy the spectacle. The holographic immersive experience and a bit of fresh innovation in the storyline, as long as they don’t feed us nonsense, it’s already good enough. The trailer only gave the main storyline, revealing very little of the plot, but the visuals were clearly meticulously crafted, the budget is ample, and it made viewers want to buy the holographic movie rights and continue following its release...
 

 

 

 
This is the mainstream opinion.
 

 

 

 
And Tong Zhao’s fans, especially the beauty-focused ones, are absolutely satisfied!
 

 

 

 
It’s as if overnight, the entire Weibo and some entertainment forums were filled with discussions about the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer. Sun Sa, as expected, reaped the benefits of being tied to Tong Zhao. Plus, he’s really handsome, and under Shi Qianqiu’s direction, he particularly gives off that "knight in shining armor" vibe. His smile is full of sunshine, and he’s straightforward and clear-headed.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa has undeniably become the best on-screen partner for Tong Zhao since her debut.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang played the villain, and in the film, Tong Zhao had another boyfriend.
 

 

 

 
As for Han Zhi, well, that’s actually Tong Zhao herself.
 

 

 

 
When you count them all up, Sun Sa takes the top spot.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans are not too happy about it—
 

 

 

 
After all, when CPs are hyped, the lesser-known side is usually thrilled, while the popular side doesn't really want to be dragged along. But since the new film is coming out, and Sun Sa’s private social media posts were found to be quite fan-oriented, some of Tong Zhao’s fans could relate to him. So, the atmosphere among fans is somewhat harmonious, and there hasn't been much fighting.
 

 

 

 
However, the trailer and the official stills from ‘The Iya Myth’, with the two of them in the same frame, are just too perfect!
 

 

 

 
The pure and noble saintess, and the knight who only wants to protect the gods with an untainted heart—if this isn’t the perfect pairing, then what is? The official couple has the sky as their limit, with so much sweetness that you can't get enough of it!
 

 

 

 
[Isn’t a saintess paired with a little puppy dog charming?]
 

 

 

 
[If I want a little puppy dog, I’d rather go for the rich young master…]
 

 

 

 
[I just hope the newcomer doesn’t drag Tong Zhao down.]
 

 

 

 
At some point, whenever Tong Zhao makes a move, it feels like a national celebration. The internet is buzzing with discussions about her, and in real life, mentioning her name often sparks a conversation.
 

 

 

 
Just this level of popularity is priceless.
 

 

 

 
There’s no helping it—every time she has a new project, not only does she never disappoint, but she also constantly delivers surprises.
 

 

 

 
She’s the most watchable actor among the performers in the "Instinct" film series.
 

 

 

 
With overwhelming promotion, many audience members who pre-booked tickets are eager to witness the sweet romance and the magnificent otherworldly scenery. Even before the movie has been released, many already love Tong Zhao’s saintess look, which gives off a high-and-mighty vibe.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
On the first day of the ‘The Iya Myth’ premiere, what was the audience's reaction after the first screening?
 

 

 

 
Their response was the same as Sun Sa’s that day.
 

 

 

 
Thousands of words turned into a single exclamation: "Wow!"
 

 

 

 
This "wow" made those who hadn’t managed to catch the first screening panic.
 

 

 

 
[Stop just saying "wow", give us some real content! I’m not afraid of spoilers!]
 

 

 

 
——[Don’t say you’re not afraid of spoilers, this movie really isn’t something you should watch after being spoiled. I suggest you go watch the first public screening ASAP, or you’ll be hit by spoilers everywhere. Seriously, it’s so damn… I’ll never believe in love again!]
 

 

 

 
Hearing this, some viewers thought the person was throwing a metaphorical knife.
 

 

 

 
What exactly was the situation?
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, who was resting at home, saw the first batch of movie reviews online and couldn't help but feel a sense of sympathy.
 

 

 

 
It was no use—every time he closed his eyes, he kept thinking about his saintess sister…
# Chapter130
Spoilers are inevitable.
 

 

 

 
Spoilers with a warning are a harmonious form of sharing, while spoilers without any warning may be due to a lack of awareness, or in some cases, from those who deliberately seek to upset others. And then there are those who, even as the movie is about to leave theaters, still criticize spoiler warnings. In short, human nature is such that it cannot be completely avoided.
 

 

 

 
However, with the rise of immersive films today, copyright awareness and viewing etiquette have both improved. The vast majority of people are now mindful of not spoiling movies or, at the very least, they give proper warnings when they do. The remaining few are those who deliberately seek to upset others, rushing to spoil the movie for fans who have been eagerly anticipating it but couldn't attend the premiere due to their work schedules.
 

 

 

 
So what is the true purpose of these malicious individuals?
 

 

 

 
Is it about spoiling the movie?
 

 

 

 
No, it's the thrill they get from successfully annoying others with the spoilers!
 

 

 

 
After watching 'The Iya Myth', these mischief-makers didn't escape the fate of being ironically punished by the ultimate behind-the-scenes boss, Shi Qianqiu, who left them utterly confused and humiliated. The more logical and justified his methods were, the harder it was for them to accept.
 

 

 

 
What were they thinking when they decided to spoil the movie?
 

 

 

 
If they spoiled it...
 

 

 

 
The viewers who later watched it would already be mentally prepared, carrying a protective shield with them, so they wouldn’t be as upset.
 

 

 

 
Is this good?
 

 

 

 
No, it’s not!!!
 

 

 

 
These little troublemakers, who thought they could annoy others through spoilers, all unknowingly closed their mouths.
 

 

 

 
If “throwing shade” were an art form, then Shi Qianqiu would be the master. His traditional skill was to coat the blade with the sweetest sugar, and Tong Zhao was the sharpest blade in his hands. Some fans were amused to find that 'The Iya Myth' didn’t have spoilers flying all over the place on its opening day. They were able to catch it after work, curious to see what it was all about.
 

 

 

 
Smiling when they entered the theater, and leaving with tears in their eyes.
 

 

 

 
A lively scene appeared in the review section—
 

 

 

 
"Can Shi Qianqiu just die?????"
 

 

 

 
"I’m so stupid, really, how could I believe in that old crook Shi's movie!"
 

 

 

 
"Summary of Shi Qianqiu's movie: A dazzling, jewel-encrusted knife."
 

 

 

 
"Isn’t this even more tear-jerking than ‘The Day of Becoming a God’???"
 

 

 

 
Even viewers who aren’t interested in fantasy genres were intrigued by the flood of angry comments, and started replying with questions: 
 

 
"Is the movie really bad? Did Tong Zhao’s reputation explode? Is the movie boring?"
 

 

 

 
Once the question about the movie's quality was raised, the viewers who had been furiously criticizing Shi Qianqiu suddenly fell silent, their attitudes shifting:
 

 

 

 
"The movie? It’s not bad, it’s really good..."
 

 

 

 
"But until you reach the end, you’ll never believe what kind of movie this is."
 

 

 

 
"You dare call this a love story?/dog head"
 

 

 

 
"There is love, and there’s definitely a lot of fantasy too. If you go just for the special effects, it’s worth it. Sister Zhao’s reputation didn’t explode, but her beauty and aura certainly did. Sigh, once you watch it, you’ll get it. I’m going for a second viewing, all for the saintess sister."
 

 

 

 
You can’t bully Shi Qianqiu for not having fans; he does have fans. On forums and Weibo, people started analyzing the movie: 
 

 

 

 
"Shi’s films, the first time you watch them, you watch the people, the second time, you watch the scenery, and the third time, you can actually understand the plot."
 

 

 

 
Not entirely clear, but it feels impressive.
 

 

 

 
Of course, it's not just word of mouth; the film’s marketing team didn’t spare any effort either. As soon as Sun Sa’s emotional state slightly stabilized, he and Tong Zhao appeared together on two variety shows. With an expensive promotional push, many fans who were already looking forward to Tong Zhao’s new work, along with curious netizens, bought the holographic movie tickets...
 

 

 

 
So what kind of movie 'The Iya Myth' actually is?
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
Due to its high investment, 'The Iya Myth' introduced the latest immersive viewing method.
 

 

 

 
This technology allows you to immerse yourself in a specific character, although you cannot speak or influence the plot. It’s like a solitary soul attaching itself to the character, experiencing the film from their first-person perspective, while also feeling their psychological changes. Due to the complexity of the technology, it can currently only be "possessed" by the main characters, as there isn’t enough data collected for supporting this technology with secondary characters.
 

 

 

 
Of course, this comes at an additional cost.
 

 

 

 
It’s a special service that traditional films cannot offer.
 

 

 

 
Because it’s very expensive, with high costs, only a few big-budget movies each year can afford to implement this.
 

 

 

 
So when 'The Iya Myth' only offered the option to experience the perspective of the male lead, Dion, there were some complaints, but most moviegoers agreed with the decision. After all, with the first-person perspective, you can't see "yourself," so whether they’re watching Tong Zhao or Sun Sa, most would still choose the former.
 

 

 

 
After all, the ticket price was a bit high, and those willing to pay for it were mostly doing so out of trust in Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, or they were truly passionate about the immersive viewing experience.
 

 

 

 
So this group of core movie fans immersed themselves in the character of Dion.
 

 

 

 
Among them was also Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
This technology was so advanced that you couldn’t experience it at home with just a helmet; you had to go to the cinema. He thought it would be a bit sad to go alone, so he bought an extra ticket to invite his manager to come along. But his manager said it was inconvenient.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [What’s inconvenient about it?]
 

 

 

 
Manager: [I need to go with my wife, you can go to the cinema by yourself. It’s better if you don’t bring any girls.]
 

 

 

 
Subtext: You’ve got no one to go with, but I’ve got someone.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo immediately felt a little defeated.
 

 

 

 
Actually, going alone would be fine, but since he had already bought the ticket, he gave up and posted a moment on his social media, thinking, "What if fate steps in?" He had a lot of pretty girls on WeChat who chatted with him from time to time, but he wasn't interested. He always felt it was pointless.
 

 

 

 
Like many well-off single guys.
 

 

 

 
A psychological "sea king" but an action "lonely king."
 

 

 

 
Then, someone Song Wanzhuo never expected left a comment.
 

 

 

 
Not only that, but they also sent him a private message, with a voice note.
 

 

 

 
——[I’m free that day, we can watch it together.]
 

 

 

 
Such a gentle, sexy voice.
 

 

 

 
Too bad it was a guy.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Wait, Jiang Dang, are you sure you want to watch it with me????]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [What's wrong with that?]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [A little kitten peeking out of the trash can.jpg]
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Fine, fine, let’s go watch it. But don’t act cute, I’m not into that.]
 

 

 

 
It was just a meme saved casually, and Jiang Dang didn’t think he was acting cute. He was already planning to see Tong Zhao’s movie, and since he saw it on social media, he decided to invite Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
As for Song Wanzhuo, he was being more practical.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang was getting really popular lately, even more than him, so there was no harm in getting more familiar with him.
 

 

 

 
The two of them, fully armed, arrived at the cinema on the third day of 'The Iya Myth'’s release.
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's eyes, they began their adventure in the land of Garan.
 

 

 

 
The first fifteen minutes didn’t feature Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
"I can’t wait to see Tong Zhao, but the movie itself isn’t boring. While Dion is passing the test to earn his knight status, it also introduces the world-building. Such mature narrative shots, no wonder it’s directed by Shi Qianqiu," Song Wanzhuo rambled, commenting. The first fifteen minutes were very traditional for an action movie, with some flashy, expensive scenery: “Damn it, the male lead isn’t just a decoration in the movie, this newcomer is making a killing. I’m so jealous. How come this luck didn’t fall on me? I feel like my subconscious is quite similar to his.”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s subconscious image was quite mature.
 

 

 

 
He was a calm, composed, authoritative leader-type personality, with a touch of "bro culture."
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang nodded seriously: “Yeah, how come this kind of luck didn’t fall on me? My subconscious is also quite suitable for it.”
 

 

 

 
“...”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo turned to look at him: “Are you serious?”
 

 

 

 
“Seriously.”
 

 

 

 
You might have a misunderstanding about what "subconscious" means…
 

 

 

 
After looking at that handsome face, which seemed oblivious to how problematic it was, Song Wanzhuo decided it was better to put on his helmet and focus on the movie.
 

 

 

 
The movie progressed to the point where the female lead, Iya, made her appearance.
 

 

 

 
In the immersive experience, the audience could fully feel the shock in the heart of the male lead, Dion, when he first saw the Saintess Iya.
 

 

 

 
Even without the immersive experience, just from the holographic viewing, they could still empathize with him.
 

 

 

 
How could it be more beautiful than the scenes in the trailer that had been enhanced?
 

 

 

 
The young girl stepped forward and bowed. The light from the temple illuminated her face, and for a moment, all the audience held their breath, unable to take their eyes off her. She was so fragile and delicate, every strand of her hair glowing as if bathed in light. The pity for the weak was not just a man's privilege; even the female audience members who came to the cinema with their boyfriends at this moment couldn’t help but feel the desire to engage in a yuri romance with her.
 

 

 

 
Being a beauty addict knows no gender.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo was the typical example of a straight man audience member who was struck by an aesthetic blow.
 

 

 

 
“My god… just watching her face alone makes it worth it. Wuwu, she should take more beautiful, beautiful movies like this, and fewer fighting action films. A woman’s gentleness and fragility are so alluring. I am just Dion, I want to protect the Saintess for the rest of my life!”
 

 

 

 
He whispered as he watched the movie.
 

 

 

 
Anyway, it was a private box, so it wouldn't disturb anyone else.
 

 

 

 
“She is indeed beautiful.”
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang paused: “But I think she’s also very charming when she’s fighting.”
 

 

 

 
Especially when she’s fighting against him.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s obsession with her looks was interrupted again.
 

 

 

 
Thankfully, the immersive experience, where he could enjoy Tong Zhao’s gentle words from the male lead’s perspective, was an absolute treat for a fanboy like him, making his desire to protect her grow to unprecedented levels.
 

 

 

 
The main plot of 'The Iya Myth' revolves around the crisis brought by the red moon and the Light Festival.
 

 

 

 
The Pope promises that if Iya completes her mission and returns alive, he will choose her to be the true Saintess of the Royal Church in the capital.
 

 

 

 
The main storyline and pacing of a commercial blockbuster are typically very clear, and this was a shared understanding among the audience. So when this "carrot" was dangled in front of them, they instinctively remembered it and confidently thought—yeah, this is probably the reward the protagonist will get in the grand finale, not bad at all.
 

 

 

 
The plotline follows the protagonist's team as they venture into the Dark Flower Forest to destroy the Dark Temple, with dangers in the forest serving as a secondary element of the story.
 

 

 

 
Mediocre movies often stretch the runtime, but excellent movies don’t have dull moments. 'The Iya Myth' has a fast-paced storyline. The main group quickly enters the Dark Flower Forest, introducing a new visual spectacle— 
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's perspective, a dense fog surrounds them, and Norence cautiously sets up a barrier. This young magician is soon horrified to find that his barrier is useless; they are pulled into an illusion.
 

 

 

 
In this illusion, it seems like they are flying, overlooking the entire Garan continent from above.
 

 

 

 
The continent starts with only animals and birds, but soon, human civilization emerges.
 

 

 

 
This is the perspective of the gods.
 

 

 

 
The viewing experience is so thrilling that Song Wanzhuo forgets he came to see his "wife." He is so excited that he can’t stop praising Shi Qianqiu, calling him the god of money-burning aesthetics.
 

 

 

 
So entering the Dark Flower Forest is like playing a simulation game from a god's perspective?
 

 

 

 
The main group witnesses the divine battle between two gods, and Song Wanzhuo, who bought the Dion perspective, feels emotionally charged. He wants to fight with the dark faction for 300 rounds. Dion feels the same way. He is a devout believer and has already made a vow in his heart that as long as he is alive, he will protect the Temple of Light with his life and never let the Dark God invade the capital again.
 

 

 

 
Iya says nothing but looks at him gently, her eyes filled with pity and affection.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang’s heart stirs.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, however, is too caught up in the moment, floating on pink bubbles as he’s gazed at by the goddess: "I can’t handle this, I’m so smitten by the goddess, Jiang Dang, react to this!"
 

 

 

 
"What kind of reaction...?"
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang looks a little dazed. After hesitating, he says, "It feels a bit like ‘Alice in Wonderland’."
 

 

 

 
Facing the conflict in the history of divine wars, the male protagonist unhesitatingly stands on the side of the God of Light.
 

 

 

 
In the "illusion," they arrive at the center of the Sea of Time and witness the scene of two gods negotiating. Though it is just a lingering illusion, the immense presence of these gods still carries an overwhelming pressure. The sun slowly rises from the east, and a golden line stretches along the horizon. Iya, seemingly unaffected by the divine pressure, walks lightly on the water’s surface as though she were an ant.
 

 

 

 
From the public perspective, the scene appears expansive, with Iya positioned between the two gods.
 

 

 

 
From Dion’s perspective…
 

 

 

 
He only saw the girl’s ethereal, elf-like beauty, and his heart felt as sweet as honey. Amidst the stunning visual spectacle, he could see only her, and his gaze was entirely captivated by her.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya turned around and flashed him a brilliant smile.
 

 

 

 
"Dion,"
 

 

 

 
"Is this what a god looks like?"
 

 

 

 
If falling in love had a sound, it must be the saint’s call of his name.
 

 

 

 
Up to this point, the movie was all sweetness.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, a fan of the boyfriend character, was completely swept up in the sweetness. He imagined that his relationship with Tong Zhao should be like this—she is certainly capable, but he could also be her great hero in her world, saving the Galan continent. Though it seemed a bit cliché, what young person hasn’t dreamed of that? Becoming a great hero and embracing a beautiful woman.
 

 

 

 
The illusion’s mystery was solved, and they found the way to the Dark God’s temple.
 

 

 

 
They had to offer the heart of a believer of light to enter.
 

 

 

 
At this point, the audience finally let out a relieved breath.
 

 

 

 
In a Shi Qianqiu movie, if things aren’t stirring up some trouble, it’s just not right.
 

 

 

 
Wasn’t ‘Heartless Tribulation’ like that? It set up a trap for the protagonist.
 

 

 

 
"Hehe, the knife from Shi the Old Thief is finally here," Song Wanzhuo said with confidence, having seen ‘Heartless Tribulation’ before. "With little Sister Xiao Zhao here, what trap can’t she break? Can her subconscious be stopped?"
 

 

 

 
After attempting and failing to force his way through the door, before Iya could speak, Dion boldly volunteered to dig out his own heart. This greatly increased his appeal to many audience members who loved the innocent, big-hearted boy type.
 

 

 

 
— "No, I won’t let you sacrifice yourself."
 

 

 

 
Iya shook her head, still looking as fragile and beautiful as ever.
 

 

 

 
Her voice was clear and melodious, and anyone watching at this point would think she was about to sacrifice herself. The supporting character, Norence, who had initially held some prejudice against her, now felt deeply moved and ashamed, realizing how high the saint's level of self-awareness was.
 

 

 

 
Accompanied by solemn and heavy music, the audience remained calm, confident that Tong Zhao’s subconscious would find a way.
 

 

 

 
No director can ever outdo her!
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu surely values her ability to break through obstacles, right?
 

 

 

 
Haha, they think they can hurt us? No way.
 

 

 

 
We’re just waiting for Tong Zhao’s comeback. Ah, but the atmosphere is so touching; Dion and Iya make such a sweet couple…
 

 

 

 
The next moment, the music abruptly stopped.
 

 

 

 
— "Isn't there a ready one here?"
 

 

 

 
Iya asked in confusion, her voice as pure and innocent as always.
 

 

 

 
After being assigned to the role of the saint-in-training, these orphaned girls were well-protected and rarely seen by outsiders. As a result, Iya always appeared naive and innocent, unaware of the ways of the world. Norence had always found this trait annoying, thinking that Iya didn't understand the hardships of the world, which made her seem pretentious and annoying, almost like an out-of-touch princess.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya reached out with an empty hand—
 

 

 

 
‘Puff’.
 

 

 

 
A small, still-beating red heart appeared in her snow-white, delicate hand.
 

 

 

 
Before Norence could ask why, she stared at Iya in shock.
 

 

 

 
Just like the countless audience members, she was bewildered and unable to comprehend what was happening, her breath halting in fear and despair as she collapsed in the mud.
 

 

 

 
The audience wondered, ‘Is Tong Zhao breaking character?’ From her subconscious performance in ‘One Life Survivor', it’s possible she could make a move like this—sacrificing her teammates with the knife. With her somewhat indifferent sense of good and evil, she didn’t seem to be a good fit for the character of Iya…
 

 

 

 
As these thoughts raced through their minds, Iya placed the still-dripping heart in the center of the door.
 

 

 

 
"Do you know why only those who maintain a devout faith in the God of Light can enter the Flowering Fog Forest? Because the key to open the temple is the heart of the faithful," Iya continued softly, without any background music. Her enchanting voice was more captivating than any melody: "I didn’t want you to be the sacrifice..."
 

 

 

 
Dion finally understood.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, he still didn’t believe Iya was a bad person. He thought she had killed to protect him. He lifted his teammate’s body and moved it aside, so it wouldn’t be swallowed by the mud. Then he hurriedly chased after Iya to question her.
 

 

 

 
The interior of the Dark God’s temple was complex, but the Saintess seemed as though she had returned home.
 

 

 

 
"Protect you? No," 
 

 

 

 
Iya glanced at him in surprise, almost finding it amusing. "For someone like you, it must hurt more for your teammates to sacrifice themselves for you than for you to sacrifice yourself, right? For Norence, she values her life above all. Even if she considers you a friend, she would rather be the one who survives when it comes to choosing between the two of you."
 

 

 

 
Under Dion’s frantic gaze, he saw the bloodstained hem of her white dress.
 

 

 

 
She was still beautiful, breathtakingly so.
 

 

 

 
But now, he couldn’t understand her anymore.
 

 

 

 
Iya’s tone was light and ethereal, and even her voice seemed to echo in the vast temple. "Seeing her desire to live like this, I just want her to die.”
 

 

 

 
At this moment, even the audience who had the most faith in Tong Zhao knew something was off.
 

 

 

 
However, the pacing of this scene was very fast, not giving the audience any time to pause and think. Iya entered the temple, activated the magic circle, and accepted the Dark God’s inheritance. At this point, both the male lead and the audience were reminded of what seemed like a dull world-building exposition at the beginning of the film…
 

 

 

 
So, the trap was buried here?
 

 

 

 
Turns out, this handsome guy betrayed the revolution?
 

 

 

 
Iya showed him the perspective of the Dark God’s war.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, the audience thought:
 

 

 

 
Hmm, there’s a twist. The Dark God is actually a good guy, with his own reasons.
 

 

 

 
Did Shi Qianqiu really think he could fool the audience?
 

 

 

 
The Dark God is indeed the embodiment of evil, with no redeeming qualities.
 

 

 

 
However, a hundred years ago, the Dark God no longer existed on the continent of Galan.
 

 

 

 
The God of Light had long since abandoned its followers.
 

 

 

 
The Red Moon's arrival was a scheme orchestrated by the Church to summon dark creatures, causing widespread devastation, all to intimidate the king and make him obedient to the Pope and the Church.
 

 

 

 
— "Since both the guards and the ones worshiping are false gods who love to cause disasters, why not just worship me?"
 

 

 

 
— "I am the new god of the Galan continent."
 

 

 

 
— "And I will be your only faith."
 

 

 

 
The Saintess, now with the Dark God's inheritance, wore a white gown that instantly turned black, like ink wrapping around her delicate, snow-white figure. Her logic was easy to understand: the Church had always been creating "natural disasters" to secure their position, right? Well, she would give them exactly what they wanted. The real Dark God arrived with the Red Moon, and now it’s time to kneel and worship her!
 

 

 

 
Dion was confused.
 

 

 

 
Of course, at this point, the movie was only halfway through.
 

 

 

 
The audience could tell from the runtime that there was still time left for a comeback and reversal.
 

 

 

 
Iya let him go, allowing him to safely return to the capital with Norence’s body.
 

 

 

 
Along with him came the news of the Dark God’s arrival on the Galan continent. Inside the Church, everything seemed calm. They thought their "false appearance" had succeeded, until dark creatures attacked on a scale far beyond their expectations, and they realized they had overplayed their hand.
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu truly had a great eye for talent.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, the little friend, is a righteous companion with an unprecedented sense of duty. He believes that since he has learned the truth, he has an obligation to correct the wrongs. With such a strong sense of justice, it's a waste of talent if he doesn't do some quick transmigration. After a series of struggles, the truth of the Church's deceitful actions was revealed by the male lead, but even though the former Dark God was fake, the current Dark Saintess is real!
 

 

 

 
The birth of the Dark God means endless war and suffering.
 

 

 

 
The responsibility to slay the gods once again falls on the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Iya, who has just received the inheritance, is not yet at the strength of a god. She only has the ability to summon dark creatures. All they need to do is find her and figure out a way to kill her. The male lead shoulders the hope of the entire capital, but all the audience who bought the immersive experience knows that he is still in love with her.
 

 

 

 
He doesn't even want to win; he'd rather die at her hands.
 

 

 

 
But his sense of justice drives him to give everything he has, without holding back.
 

 

 

 
The movie is a commercial film, and Shi Qianqiu is always good at delivering on the "satisfaction" aspect.
 

 

 

 
After overcoming many hardships, the male lead arrived at the site of the ultimate battle—according to the literature he had found and deciphered, it was best to rest at the place where the old gods' aura was the strongest after receiving the divine inheritance. Thus, he found the center of the Sea of Time, the place where the two gods had departed…
 

 

 

 
This is the first time he had truly reached the core of the Sea of Time.
 

 

 

 
The last time was only in an illusion.
 

 

 

 
Countless audience members, along with Dion, saw his beloved.
 

 

 

 
Iya took the red crescent moon from the sky and used it as a seat, resting her long legs on the tail of the red moon. It glowed with a cold light, casting her pale white skin like snow. Her platinum blonde curls fell across her small, rounded shoulders, and when she heard the sound, she turned around and smiled:
 

 

 

 
“You really came.”
 

 

 

 
This scene was not designed by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 

 

 
He has good taste, but he never expected her to be so bold as to take the moon and use it as a mount.
 

 

 

 
This was a habit Iya had developed over the long years.
 

 

 

 
The heavens, earth, sun, and moon were all at her disposal.
 

 

 

 
This is bad.
 

 

 

 
Both the male lead and Jiang Dang thought to themselves.
 

 

 

 
It seems like he's fallen in love with her again.
# Chapter131
The final battle was the most intense scene for the entire crew to film.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had arranged the counterattack mechanism for the male lead.
 

 
The problem was, his opponent was Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was ‘Tong Zhao’, after all!
 

 
In a system that was well-developed and logically complete, her subconscious, even in the face of adversity, often found a way to survive. How could she be turned over in a situation where her side had such a strong advantage? Even someone as harsh as Shi Qianqiu had to arrange some powerful artifacts for the male lead, such as the divine sword ‘Twilight of the Gods’, and added one more setting...
 

 
The reason why the dark creatures increased in number and became so powerful when the red moon rose was because the Dark God had bestowed part of his divine power on his followers, creating a situation where they appeared strong on the outside but were weak on the inside.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu did everything he could to weaken Iya and strengthen the male lead.
 

 
Despite all the hidden operations, Shi Qianqiu still couldn't rest easy.
 

 
It would be easy to let Tong Zhao win.
 

 
But making her lose? That would be almost impossible.
 

 
The male lead's weapon was a sword that could fulfill every boy's fantasy, glowing with a faint light. The holy knight walked forward, his armor still shining white. And Iya? She jumped down from the red moon, her toes barely touching the water's surface. Was she going to summon a divine artifact out of thin air?
 

 
While the audience was pondering, Iya bent down, and her slender waist caught everyone's attention.
 

 
Including the male lead's.
 

 
With graceful movements, she reached into the water, grasping the reflection of the "Red Moon" on the surface. She pulled out the shadow of the moon from the sea, and a scarlet sickle, dripping with cold seawater, appeared in her hand. It looked like a death god harvesting the lives of everything.
 

 
"Shit! So that wasn't just a reflection?"
 

 
"No way! I need to buy the video and watch this closely. It was clearly a shadow!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was mesmerized.
 

 
He was a typical member of the movie audience—someone whose primary expectation was that the plot made sense. He came to watch the special effects, and he was easily captivated by imaginative and breathtaking visuals. It's easy to please him. As he excitedly watched the screen burning through the budget with impressive scenes, he wondered how the male lead would manage to turn the tables, given the huge gap in strength between the two sides.
 

 
Earlier in the story, it had been established that the male lead wasn't fighting alone. He had teammates from the capital, and they were splitting up to find a way to break the deadlock at the Dark God Temple in the Flowering Forest, while he sought out the core of the conflict on his own.
 

 
This was a very traditional commercial movie trope.
 

 
Unlike the antagonist, the protagonist is distinguished by their strong sense of teamwork. But when it comes to the critical moment, it’s the protagonist who must defeat the opponent personally, with teammates playing a supporting role. Shi Qianqiu was well-versed in this, and he never made a mistake with the pacing.
 

 
Before the "betrayal," Iya was quiet and always appeared serene and beautiful.
 

 
But after her "dark turn"...
 

 
"Since you have to have faith, why not believe in me?"
 

 
"True arrogance lies in making others repent. Why is the path you choose the right one, and mine wrong? The Dark God is the ultimate faith of the entire continent. The church created the dark creatures and sparked wars to seize power. Doesn’t that align perfectly with our teachings?"
 

 
The lavish special effects produced by Shi Qianqiu dazzled on the screen. The female lead, Iya, with her graceful yet imposing presence, managed to hold her own even in a scene dominated by explosive battle effects. In fact, it left the audience feeling overwhelmed, and those who purchased the immersive experience felt they definitely got their money's worth. They could strongly empathize with the male lead's intense admiration and internal struggle for her—this was an experience unique to holographic films! It was like the 3D experience of ‘Avatar’ back in the day. No bootleg could shake its box office dominance. Why? Because it was a movie you couldn’t experience at home; you had to go to the best Lam IMAX theater to fully appreciate the visual effects...
 

 
This gave the audience a compelling reason to go to the cinema.
 

 
With this kind of special experience, who would have trouble convincing the audience to open their wallets?
 

 
If you wanted to see such an explosive scene and the goddess portrayed by Tong Zhao, you had to go to the cinema!
 

 
Every critic who went to see this movie had to admit that Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu were the true power duo.
 

 
Imagine if another actress had been cast instead; she would have been overshadowed by Shi Qianqiu’s aesthetic dominance and relegated to a secondary role. Such dazzling special effects would steal the audience’s attention. Just like the actor who played the male lead, Sun Sa, despite his impressive performance and effort, he couldn’t help but fall into the background during this climactic moment, becoming a mere tool for the plot.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was different.
 

 
It is hard to explain in words, but in the holographic world, Tong Zhao was so naturally perfect for her role, it felt as if she was always meant to be a deity. She perfectly integrated into the character's setting, with the skills and effects of the heavens, earth, sun, and moon only serving as accessories to enhance her. The audience continued to focus on her, placing their attention on her no matter what.
 

 
As the audience and Dion were immersed in the grand scene, Iya spread her arms and cheerfully said:
 

 
"Try your best to please me."
 

 
...
 

 
The male lead didn't start out with the intention to kill. He tried to persuade Iya, telling her that the church's atrocities had been exposed and the king would not let them go. In fact, the capital was in chaos, the pope would not end up well, and as long as she stopped commanding the dark creatures to torment the people...
 

 
"From the moment I accepted the Dark God's inheritance, I was destined to commit evil. Asking me to stop is like asking a fish to leave the water, asking for no breath, or asking the sun to no longer rise in the east."
 

 
Iya smiled, her delicate face glowing with a divine golden halo as she stood against the light:
 

 
"The capital is in chaos, but what about those suffering saintesses? They were once stakes in a gamble, cannon fodder, playthings—did anyone care about them? The church has no innocent members, not even me. I couldn't save anyone from the hell the church built, but now I am the ruler of this hell, and it's my turn to set the rules."
 

 
The two of them fought for a long time.
 

 
But from the audience's perspective, everything happened very quickly.
 

 
The entire Garan continent followed Diya's wishes. When the Red Moon descended, the dark creatures fiercely invaded the capital, causing countless casualties. The once-protective temples became primary targets for attacks. Everyone knew that the church had been intentionally summoning dark creatures all along, even transforming discarded saintesses into dark creatures using secret rituals. Now, however, things had backfired—this creation had turned on them.
 

 
The God of Light did not respond to the prayers of its followers.
 

 
From the perspective of ordinary people, it seemed that the Dark God wasn’t as “greedy” as they thought. After all, wasn't it the church that liked to keep summoning? The artificial Red Moon descending? If you enjoy playing so much, fine, I’m here now—let’s see if you can handle it.
 

 
No one could handle it.
 

 
The people's complaints boiled over as the once-sacred capital temple was shattered into pieces, and there was hope that someone would come forward to clean up the mess.
 

 
At this point, Shi Qianqiu used the camera to its fullest effect. Even the audience who chose the immersive viewing experience could still feel the world that the heroine, Iya, summoned, and from the perspective of a god, things appeared distant and detached. Human life seemed so small, almost negligible.
 

 
There is a difference between humans and gods. Dion could not be so high and mighty. He still felt pity and guilt for the loss of life.
 

 
The sound effects of the holographic filming were explosive, with the dialogue at the climax of the final battle resonating in every viewer’s ears.
 

 
—Iya said, "This is your weakness."
 

 
—Dion replied, "But it also makes me strong."
 

 
Without suspense, the protagonist emerged victorious.
 

 
The victor did not feel triumphant. He was momentarily confused, then showed a look of puzzlement. Everything had happened so quickly. His god-slaying deeds were somehow synchronized and displayed in the sky above the continent of Galan, and everyone witnessed his greatness. They believed he had resolved the incident. Although he did not attain godhood, he was elevated to the same level.
 

 
The two gods had departed, and the people still needed faith.
 

 
Thus, Dion, who had defeated the great villain, was revered as the new Pope.
 

 
The Red Moon ended early.
 

 
Everyone celebrated the Dark God’s defeat by the new Pope, and the old sins were cleansed. The king was deeply grateful to Dion.
 

 
No one noticed that the once bright, shining sword of the new Pope had become entwined with a streak of red, and the cheerful, smiling Dion had not shown a smile ever since.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s cinematic portrayal was always rich in detail, providing the audience with the pleasure of solving puzzles, yet never so obscure that only after the movie ended would they need to read reviews to understand it fully. If that happened, it would mean the director failed—while it’s good for the audience to find deeper meaning in reviews, if they can’t understand the movie without them, it means the director needs to improve in storytelling and cinematography.
 

 
The audience’s perspective revealed something.
 

 
Iya had intentionally let him off the hook, even creating a situation that pushed him to a high position.
 

 
The sins of the old church had to be erased, and she also had a grudge against the continent of Galan. She exposed all the truths that needed to be revealed, and dying by his hands was the best ending.
 

 
Dion had passed her test.
 

 
As Iya had observed, he embodied the most traditional knightly spirit—he was a person of noble character, both wise and brave.
 

 
...
 

 
"After watching the movie, all I want to say is, did you see the Time Sea in the final battle? That’s where Iya let the protagonist off the hook."
 

 
"No, those are just the tears that flowed from my eyes."
 

 
"Old thief Shi, die!!"
 

 
"The goddess I loved was fake, but let’s discuss rationally—did Iya really love Dion?"
 

 
...
 

 
Many who hadn’t bought the immersive experience due to its high price struggled for a while after removing their helmets, only to end up purchasing the expensive tickets.
 

 
And many core fans, who weren’t short on money and were still left wanting more, decided to watch it again.
 

 
When buying tickets for a second viewing, they suddenly realized...
 

 
They could actually choose to view the film from Iya’s perspective in the immersive experience?
 

 
Wait, they could even unlock hidden perspectives in the second round??
 

 
As the audience thought about it, they immediately understood everything.
 

 
If the first viewing was from Iya's perspective, there would be no "surprise" twist. Watching from Dion's perspective would provide the best experience, just like the first viewing.
 

 
Originally, the audience was already satisfied after watching it once, but now, with the new perspective from the female protagonist...
 

 
Four big words appeared in their minds:
 

 
"Tears for the second viewing."
 

 
Tong Zhao also went to watch it.
 

 
She went with her friends from Zeshan, and the rich young man from the group, Wei, booked the whole theater. The friends chatted freely without worrying about disturbing others.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao didn't join in the conversation.
 

 
She was busy interacting with her sister, the Saintess.
 

 
When the movie reached the part where the female protagonist was about to let Dion off the hook...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Ah, so this is the Iya sister who is pure evil and wants the world to end?]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Consort Chen: [No way, no way, no one would do good deeds under the flag of a villain, right? I could do better—I'd immediately gather three thousand male concubines to serve this goddess, and the continent of Galan would instantly become a female-dominant world.]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [How should I put this?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [The female bodhisattva is actually me?]
 

 
The Saintess sister was so angry that she crushed the eyeball embedded in the scepter's head with one hand.
 

 
Instinctive cinema reflects the truest subconscious.
 

 
Iya said she was absolutely evil.
 

 
Zhao Zai peeked out: [Is this being tsundere?]
 

 
...
 

 
The damage wasn’t great, but the insult was extremely strong.
# Chapter132
Inside the Palace of Consciousness:
 

 
Iya: "How much is the box office?"
 

 
Each persona has their own individual room, and Iya, who would normally shut herself in and ignore everyone, has been spending more time in the living room after ‘The Iya Myth’ was released, rarely returning to her room. Consort Chen, who loves to watch the drama, asked her: "Didn’t the Saintess say she doesn't care?"
 

 
Iya: "......"
 

 
Duan Ge: "She wants to know how many people saw her journey."
 

 
For the audience who purchased the immersive viewing experience and chose Iya's perspective, they can feel Iya’s every action, and the motivations behind them… Some anime fans can write thousands of words about a character's actions, just to analyze the character’s motivation. However, unless officially recognized, these analyses usually remain unconfirmed.
 

 
Person A thinks the protagonist eats because they’re hungry. Person B thinks the protagonist eats to start a conversation with another character.
 

 
Don't ask, just know they've shipped it.
 

 
Anyway, the official side usually doesn't comment.
 

 
In the case of ‘The Iya Myth’, the question is whether the villain intentionally let Dion win or if she truly couldn’t be beaten.
 

 
With immersive viewing, there’s no ambiguity. Every audience member can clearly feel that Iya knew the truth behind the Saintess selection and the two gods. From the very beginning of the film, she was determined to martyr herself—only by gaining the power to challenge the vast force of the Light Church could she walk a dangerous path, fully aware that the deeper her connection with the Dark God, the more her mind would be influenced.
 

 
By the latter half of the film, Iya was struggling against her own survival instincts, only thinking about how to die with meaning. Death was not something to fear.
 

 
Immersive viewing was incredibly engaging, but even with regular holographic viewing, the audience could still feel Iya's allure, moved to tears.
 

 
It was truly hard to come to terms with.
 

 
After watching the movie, fans couldn't help but wonder if there was a possibility of a happy ending—since Iya is so good and Dion loves her so much, why couldn't there be a "prince and princess live happily ever after" conclusion?
 

 
Good people deserve a good ending, which is what most of the audience feels.
 

 
Iya is a good person, with no flaws.
 

 
Dion is also a good kid.
 

 
So where's the problem?
 

 
After much thought, the audience finally reached a unified conclusion—
 

 
"The source of all evil, Shi Qianqiu—who supports and who opposes?"
 

 
[I declare that Shi Qianqiu is the real villain!]
 

 
[I declare your declaration is valid.]
 

 
[The Saintess Sister is not only kind-hearted, but also super kind, but Shi Qianqiu really has no heart!!!]
 

 
Recently, Tong Zhao has developed an unexpected love for browsing the internet and reading movie reviews.
 

 
Her agent was quite surprised, saying that she didn't realize she enjoyed reading praise about herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled: "Of course!"
 

 
Iya held her head: "Stop reading it..."
 

 
Consort Chen, with an opera-like tone, sweetly read out the reviews: "How could the Saintess Sister be absolutely evil? She's clearly too kind! Just thinking about how she was heading for martyrdom from the start makes me feel sorry for her. Iya is a little angel!"
 

 
The cute ending of the word ‘ba’ (a cute tone) was drawn out in an adorable loli voice.
 

 
Duan Ge had a hard time holding back his laughter.
 

 
Consort Chen really knows how to make people uncomfortable.
 

 
Elder Lu patted Iya on the shoulder, and everything was silently understood.
 

 
After Tong Zhao made slight adaptations to Iya's experiences and turned them into a script, almost all the critics felt that she wasn't a bad person. She was inherently kind, and her actions had never been wrong. The only bad thing was Shi Qianqiu, the director. When Consort Chen read the third review aloud, Iya couldn't take it anymore and retreated to her room.
 

 
Elder Lu: "Stop always bullying her."
 

 
Consort Chen: "When the disease is severe, you have to use strong medicine. The child spends all day fantasizing that she's the irredeemable villain—she's probably just craving compliments."
 

 
Tong Zhao could only laugh and say "hahaha."
 

 
The movie was titled ‘Iya Myth’, but for ordinary people and those in the entertainment industry who didn't understand the full story, this was just another box office success created by Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu. Wherever they went, they were living, breathing box office machines.
 

 
Thanks to ‘Iya Myth’'s excellent box office performance, its screenings in real-world theaters also increased significantly. In the era of immersive cinema, audiences with helmets or capsules could enjoy watching movies at home, but what they came to the theaters for was the interactive experience, especially those who purchased the "immersive viewing" experience.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ breaks another box office record on opening day, with a single-day peak reaching..."
 

 
"Box office slump reversed? Reviews exploded? Tong Zhao continues her undefeated legend."
 

 
"What's the secret to ‘Iya Myth’'s success? Could immersive viewing be the new wealth code?"
 

 
From the script's perspective, ‘Iya Myth’ wasn't a particularly complicated story.
 

 
If you're asking how deep it is, not really.
 

 
At least Shi Qianqiu never thought about winning the Best Script Award; he only submitted for Best Special Effects and Best Actress.
 

 
When he gave an interview, he straightforwardly said: "The script was written by Tong Zhao. She was interested in the story, so okay, I accompanied her to film it and helped her come up with ways to make the movie interesting and profitable. We didn’t aim to explore profound human nature; we just wanted to give the audience a unique fantasy journey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu's logic was always this simple and blunt.
 

 
He made movies boldly, but his ideas were very practical. His goal was to serve the audience, to create blockbuster films that everyone would love to watch and that could make money. This director, who was the least short on funds in the industry, was often the one who earned the most. One could only sigh and think, "The rich get richer."
 

 
As the audience's positive impression of him increased due to this approach, Shi Qianqiu added a piece of behind-the-scenes information: "The red smoke on the holy sword of Dion is actually the shattered soul of Iya. Why is it shattered? Haha, because the male lead killed her with his own hands."
 

 
The host paused for a moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "Hey, fans, don’t cry. Let me give you some candy. They loved each other, they liked each other."
 

 
He looked into the camera, his tone sincere.
 

 
Immediately, the screen was filled with a barrage of question marks.
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Just when I started to like him a little…]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu, are you even human?! I feel like he's stuffing a knife into my mouth while asking, "Isn't this candy sweet? How sweet is it?" But all I taste is rust...]
 

 
All the hatred was redirected to the director.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, the audience's affection for Iya's character was transferred to her.
 

 
To the audience, Tong Zhao was the Saintess herself.
 

 
If she didn’t have such a gentle and kind subconscious, could she have portrayed such a great character? No, she couldn’t have. Netizens believed this too, thinking she was especially good.
 

 
This made Tong Zhao feel a little embarrassed.
 

 
Thanks to its strong box office performance, the movie stayed in theaters for a long time before it finally ended its run.
 

 
Fans counted on their fingers, knowing that the awards season was coming. Even if they didn’t win an award, getting a nomination would be great.
# Chapter133
Upon arriving at the neighboring city, it was 2 p.m.
 

 
Tong Zhao always tried to keep her travels as low-key as possible. She didn’t need to show off her popularity by having fans brave the cold wind to pick her up. In fact, she would be bothered by it. Out of consideration for not making things harder for security, she would try her best not to acknowledge the fans on-site, walking quickly and expressionlessly under the escort of security.
 

 
After all, if the fans got too excited and were pushed around, it would be the security personnel who would be in discomfort.
 

 
But thinking about how the fans had come all the way there only to be ignored also made Tong Zhao feel bad.
 

 
The best outcome would be if no one came to pick her up.
 

 
With Tong Zhao’s insistence, the team was strict about security, and occasionally, paparazzi would snap pictures of her not being picked up by any fans at the airport. Fans felt deeply sorry for her, thinking she was being neglected in her own city. But in reality, she was quite happy about it. However, even when explained, some younger fans refused to believe it.
 

 
They insisted it was the company’s fault, that she couldn’t speak out about the truth.
 

 
When their sister said not to let them, would they really just comply?
 

 
Do they still love their sister?
 

 
Faced with such devotion, Tong Zhao could only try her best to do her job well.
 

 
“I wonder if any fans are here to pick me up…”
 

 
“You don’t need to think about it. Of course there are,” her round-faced assistant shattered her little illusion. “Xiao Zhao, the news about your nomination for the Huaying Awards is everywhere. This is such a clear schedule, it’s so easy for fans to catch you. Don’t underestimate them!”
 

 
Tong Zhao would never underestimate her fans.
 

 
Since her popularity had skyrocketed, in addition to the fans who simply admired her, there were also paparazzi and related people who came looking for profit.
 

 
Her schedule, her privacy, her photos—all of it could be sold for a high price…
 

 
As the team chatted easily, they disembarked, and sure enough, Tong Zhao could already see a sea of people waiting from afar.
 

 
She was suddenly moved: "Iya, your turn."
 

 
Iya: "Why? I'm not interested..."
 

 
Before she could finish, she was pushed into action.
 

 
After all, the main personality still had more authority.
 

 
Although when asked, Iya would usually respond with a question: "Why should I help?" However, when the responsibility was put on her, she would still stiffen her face and get it done.
 

 
Some keen-eyed people, upon seeing the target through the VIP channel, quickly turned their faces toward her. Every one of their eyes sparkled with excitement and expectation, looking at Iya with longing and admiration. Due to the airport's order, the fans didn’t dare to make too much noise; they could only express their love by holding up banners and signs—
 

 
“Zhao Zai, Mommy loves you!”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Showstopper!”
 

 
“Protect the world’s best little angel Iya!”
 

 
...
 

 
When Iya saw the third banner, her face darkened, and she averted her gaze.
 

 
The countless flashes from cameras formed a shimmering fog of light around her, making her already beautiful face look almost distorted in the halo of attention.
 

 
Her assistant had once joked that she had a divine aura.
 

 
Wasn't that true? She already had the aura of a goddess on her way out.
 

 
Finally, they spotted Tong Zhao! The fans were trying to contain their excitement, their faces flushed with joy. They whispered to their companions, sharing their impressions of seeing the star in person—“She looks a bit thinner than in the photos. Her long hair is like a cloud. She walks through the airport’s VIP channel like she’s stepping onto a red carpet, distant and natural.”
 

 
If she were an ordinary small celebrity, some fans might feel disappointed and think she was being too pretentious.
 

 
But this is Tong Zhao!
 

 
Just think about the news reports and the well-known box office achievements, Tong Zhao has the capital to be proud.
 

 
In fact, many fans actually love this superstar vibe she gives off.
 

 
Some enthusiastic, wealthy, and idle fans who have seen her in person many times lamented, “Zhao Zhao looks a little different today. She’s usually quite friendly with fans, and smiles at us. But today, she’s not smiling. However, she looks like...”
 

 
“Looks like what?”
 

 
“Is she a bit shy?”
 

 
Iya, with her keen hearing, couldn't help but cast a warning glance when she overheard this.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes, with a light hue, were misty with a subtle, entrancing look.
 

 
It was enough to steal one's soul at a glance.
 

 
The fan, who had been speaking casually, let out a short, sharp scream, electrified and speechless, overwhelmed with affection for "Sister," bending like a mosquito coil. Iya's moment of hesitation quickly disappeared, and she returned her gaze, adopting the attitude of ignoring these foolish mortals with cool detachment.
 

 
Iya heard very clearly.
 

 
Many people were saying they liked her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Hey, look, doesn't Tong Zhao's ears look a bit red?"
 

 
"Even though she didn’t say anything, I know she's still happy to see us!"
 

 
"The shy sister is just too cute!!!”
 

 
Once the fans noticed this, they got even more excited. Many airport photos were leaked, and even though the retouched ones hadn't been released yet, raw photos were already circulating with each person having their own copy. Her face was too stunning—there were no flaws. No matter how bad their photography skills were, they couldn’t go wrong—every random shot turned out beautiful. What's more, since Tong Zhao debuted, there has never been a truly unflattering photo of her. Even when people who dislike her try to spread hate, they can only post photos of her with a cold, aloof expression, accusing her of being pretentious and arrogant.
 

 
Despite the fans’ enthusiasm, "Tong Zhao" quickly jumped into the chauffeur-driven car and disappeared from view…
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao fasten her seatbelt, the assistant closed their eyes, assuming she hadn’t rested well on the plane and didn’t want to disturb her. Iya took her place, retreating to her room to be alone.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, regaining control of her body.
 

 
Ever since she exposed Iya’s "tsundere" persona, Iya had grown more self-destructive about maintaining that image.
 

 
...
 

 
The Huaying Awards were live-streamed across the internet.
 

 
Tong Zhao came with the crew of ‘Iya Myth’. Sun Sa had already emerged from his gloomy period—he was lucky, having joined the fast track with Shi and Tong early on, and throughout filming, he received shock therapy from the seasoned director, Shi Laoze. He had shed his college boy innocence and had grown into a mature man who could stand beside Tong Zhao, not necessarily a perfect match, but at least a man worthy of being her partner for a day.
 

 
The moment they stepped out of the car, they were engulfed by a sea of flashing cameras.
 

 
Sun Sa, who had been warned in advance, maintained his composure, though his stiff expression looked slightly forced.
 

 
Beside him, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of the Empress, outshining the entire scene. Despite the blinding lights, she maintained a composed smile. Her beauty was flawless, standing up to any angle. To meet the expectations of the fans, she wore a platinum-colored gown today, echoing the look of her nominated character, Iya.
 

 
Under the influence of her aura, Tong Zhao walked in real life with the effect of a movie scene. All the viewers watching the live broadcast and the fans on-site couldn’t help but hold their breath. Some fans couldn’t control themselves and shouted her name, hoping to catch her attention.
 

 
[Wow, she’s so beautiful, it’s like she’s glowing.]
 

 
[Maybe it's her accumulated box office that's glowing /manual dog head.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, I really want to see the scene live! Does she have a good chance of winning?]
 

 
The comments were buzzing with excitement.
 

 
The plot of ‘Iya Myth’ wasn’t particularly profound or complex, and it didn’t delve into social issues. The film had a high chance of winning a visual effects award, and Shi Qianqiu was almost certain to win. However, Best Actress was less certain.
 

 
Since the era of immersive cinema has nothing to do with acting skills, the standard for evaluating actors had become the degree of their standout moments.
 

 
Among this year’s nominees, there wasn’t a clear standout champion; the contenders were evenly matched, and many felt that the Huaying Awards judges should take box office performance into account. ‘Iya Myth’ had phenomenal box office results, and its support for immersive cinema was also a big plus.
 

 
Of course, this was a discussion for those particularly interested in the awards.
 

 
The remaining netizens were discussing more intuitive topics—
 

 
On various discussion forums, countless threads featuring "Tong Zhao" surged. [She and Sun Sa are really a perfect match], [Actually, I think Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu walking the red carpet together would be even better. Sun Sa is a bit weak], [What do you know? A wolfdog with a queen will always be a legend], and [Her dress is so beautiful! It suits her so well, she’s basically a modern-day Iya. I want to buy one just like it…]
 

 
Then the price of the dress posted online made everyone fall silent.
 

 
This gown was a high-end custom piece from a blue-blood brand. Sister Chu didn’t have the connections to get it, but Zeshan and the others knew that Tong Zhao had a great chance of winning and possibly earning her first Best Actress title. They all chipped in to help, with Wei Zekai coordinating everything. Actually, he could afford it alone; compared to the cost of a yacht, it was nothing, but the true value lay in the heartfelt gesture from her good friends.
 

 
The platinum-colored gown was adorned with diamonds, truly luxurious and sparkling, like a goddess draped in stars.
 

 
After a brief interview, the Huaying Awards ceremony officially began. The cameras were fairly distributed, and even Tong Zhao, who was the most popular on-site, couldn’t stay in the spotlight the entire time. However, sharp-eyed viewers quickly noticed that she was sitting between Shi Qianqiu and Sun Sa, which pleased fans supporting both pairings.
 

 
Sitting together, it was almost like they were already "officially registered."
 

 
The ceremony was lengthy, and being a guest at the event was no easy task. Wearing haute couture, one couldn’t afford to relax; you never knew when the camera might be on you. You had to remain focused on watching, and playing on your phone was out of the question...
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had her own way to pass the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "You're really playing your cards well."
 

 
Consoy Chen: "I see two kings, I call it the landlord. That’s called dominance."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Is that why you asked the system to block the synchronization of memory between different personalities?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "A little gambling is just for fun."
 

 
Zhao Zai had been bouncing around at the card table for a while.
 

 
She originally wanted to play too, but then she was scooped up by Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t bored, but the people around her were.
 

 
This was Sun Sa’s first time attending such a grand event, and he was nervous, his mind full of thoughts about how he didn’t deserve to be there. How did he go from his dilapidated dormitory at school to the Huaying Awards ceremony? His film had a good chance of winning, though not Best Picture, but it was still stirring.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he was already tired of this kind of event.
 

 
If it weren’t for the nomination, he wouldn’t have wanted to sit through hours of it.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu glanced at Tong Zhao, who was smiling and lost in thought, and spoke to her, “Are you nervous? You’re about to win your first Best Actress award.”
 

 
“I can only be considered a strong contender,” Tong Zhao replied, both candid and restrained.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stared at the stage and softly said, “Best Picture is impossible because the script is too limited, so the team is mainly focusing on Best Actress. In a few hours, you’ll be the Best Actress. Are you surprised? Excited?”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao also asked softly, “Are you the type who, when someone gets a mystery novel, immediately leans over and says, ‘The murderer is so-and-so’?”
 

 
“Otherwise, you think my brother stopped reading mystery novels for what reason?”
 

 
Life of being spoiled by spoilers.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of sympathy for this brother she had never met.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “So, are you excited or not?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Not excited.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a glance, and indeed, her small face remained calm.
 

 
Tong Zhao reflected for a moment. The first time she quick-travelled, when she became a noble concubine, ascended to immortality, when Han Zhi kept winning awards, and when she inherited the legacy of the Dark God... it seemed like she had gotten used to being excited, and over time, it became more and more mundane. What truly made her smile joyfully were the little details in daily life.
 

 
A camera captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu speaking softly to each other, and the audience thought they were probably discussing the award ceremony. Although Shi Qianqiu's words could be harsh, his analysis of films was often sharp and insightful. He also had a prophetic understanding of the film market. Many viewers who found the award ceremony boring were eager to hear what he and Tong Zhao were talking about, believing it was probably more interesting than the ceremony itself.
 

 
In reality...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "As if nothing happened."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It’s all about effort."
 

 
"Haha," Shi Qianqiu paused. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao tried hard to resist the urge to roll her eyes at him. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
---
 

 
Three minutes later, the two were still caught in a never-ending loop of wordplay over the idiom "do whatever you want.”
# Chapter134: The End of the Main Text
"First Defeat for Tong Zhao!"
 

 
A huge snow-white banner appeared out of nowhere in the consciousness palace, hanging in the middle of the living room.
 

 
What was the "first defeat"?
 

 
It was in the idiom game with Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Rewind the time by one minute—
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly sighed, "Isn’t that enough? I can’t take it anymore!"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Shi Qianqiu turned his head, a faint smile appearing on his clean, scholar-like face. "Can’t take it anymore?"
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow.
 

 
If this were a game, her question mark would already be on the screen.
 

 
The smile in Shi Qianqiu’s eyes deepened. "Do as you wish, can’t take it anymore."
 

 
...
 

 
Another cycle. How many more times?
 

 
Tong Zhao sneered, holding back the urge to curse at him—what if the camera caught her lip movements, and she couldn’t explain it? She decided to stay silent and let him embarrass himself. However, for Shi Qianqiu, embarrassment? Not possible. His skin was as thick as layers of cement. When the camera swept to their side, he still calmly smiled at it, causing a stir in the bullet screen.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is considered one of the better-looking directors.]
 

 
[Actually, he’s pretty good-looking even among male stars…]
 

 
[Don’t talk about it, just thinking about dating him makes me lose interest immediately.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had been in relationships before; his ex-girlfriend was a well-known international model.
 

 
However, his sharp remarks left such a strong impression on netizens that it’s hard to imagine him being involved in a sweet romance—his ex-girlfriend also had a world-weary, high-class look that seemed to scorn everything. When they stood together, they didn’t even need to speak to give off an air of mockery. Despite his handsome appearance, he surprisingly had very few female fans.
 

 
Soon, it was time for the highlight of tonight’s Instinct Film Awards—
 

 
The Best Actress award.
 

 
"In the film, they are the absolute main characters, and tonight, they are also the shining stars of the Huaying Awards. These five ladies are..." The presenter paused, smiling as they announced the first nominee: "Yan Yanghan, ‘The Pisces Incident’."
 

 
As the presenter called out the names, the big screen showed the nominees’ live appearances and stills from their films.
 

 
Tong Zhao was placed last on the list.
 

 
When Tong Zhao appeared on the screen, the audience only saw her nodding slightly at the camera, her cold and elegant expression betraying no hint of nervousness or expectation—true to her usual demeanor at major events. Even her most devoted fans would struggle to recall a time when she seemed nervous, even when she was just starting out. Every time she appeared, her outfit was impeccable, and her attitude graceful and composed.
 

 
"And the Best Actress award goes to—"
 

 
Amidst the heated discussions in the bullet screen, the presenter beamed an excited, sincere smile and called out towards Tong Zhao: "Tong Zhao, ‘Iya Myth!"
 

 
The scene erupted in cheers and applause, giving her a grand reception.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s popularity in the industry wasn’t particularly good or bad. Although she didn’t focus much on networking, her outstanding professional skills had earned her much goodwill. In a high-pressure work environment, a colleague who does their job well and doesn’t cause trouble is naturally treated with kindness. As for her competitors? While other actresses of the same generation may have harbored some resentment towards her, they had to admit that there was no real competition between them anymore.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao's box office success, even though they had to lower their status and invest their own money, the investors would naturally favor this money-making machine.
 

 
What does it feel like for Tong Zhao to be surrounded by applause as she steps onto the stage?
 

 
Consort Chen: "Keep the spotlight on me!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Got it, got it."
 

 
Winning her first Best Actress award felt like a coronation.
 

 
Consort Chen was highly sensitive to such occasions, and she could not afford to make any mistakes. She had to shine brighter than anyone else.
 

 
With the spotlight on her, Tong Zhao walked briskly to the award stage. The lights fell on her, and she was, as expected, the center of attention—though, even without this "golden finger" of a spotlight, she was already stunning under the glow. But with the added radiance, her mortal beauty transformed into something otherworldly, dazzling and captivating, evoking admiration from all.
 

 
[Wow, she's just so beautiful!]
 

 
[She’s been in the industry for so long, and I've probably seen her face a thousand times, but how does she still manage to look even more beautiful each time?]
 

 
[Her dress is glowing—oh my god, it’s diamond-studded—so beautiful, truly well-deserved!]
 

 
[Not going up to accept the award would be an insult to her look.]
 

 
After briefly shaking hands with the presenter, they exchanged a few words of congratulations and pleasantries before handing her the stage to deliver her acceptance speech. Tong Zhao took the Huaying Award trophy from the presenter. It was heavier than she had imagined. Turning to face the concerned faces in the crowd—
 

 
The stage below was full of stars.
 

 
But at this moment, she was the true star of the show.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath.
 

 
In reality, she wasn’t particularly interested in winning the award; she was more focused on the PR capital it brought. She even thought about letting another personality take over and handle it. But even Consort Chen, who loved being in the spotlight, insisted that Tong Zhao take the stage herself. Consort Chen had said at the time: "You might not care now, or you might never care, but this is an important moment in your life, and it can only be claimed by the most complete version of you."
 

 
So, it would be her who took it.
 

 
“I remember not too long ago, I was just a girl who was kicked out of her home and cut off from financial support. ‘Ming Emperor’ was my first—and possibly my last—chance.”
 

 
The PR team had already written her acceptance speech, but when the words reached her lips, she spoke another version.
 

 
The fans on the barrage stopped complimenting her looks, turned off their comments, and chose to silently enjoy this special moment with their idol.
 

 
Tong Zhao had once missed this opportunity.
 

 
To be exact, she had cheated. She had come back from many worlds, honing her skills by conquering them.
 

 
A wave of emotion surged within her, unrelated to the honor of being named Best Actress.
 

 
Maybe it wasn’t about conquering.
 

 
She had come back to save herself.
 

 
“Critics often say I’m difficult to figure out, that they don’t know how to define me. And I often wonder, why should I be defined? I have a diverse subconscious; I don’t want to be fixed in one place. Even if Consort Chen brings me the first Best Actress award, I won’t always use her image in the future.”
 

 
Others didn’t know that she had many personalities; they thought it was just a narrative style.
 

 
Some loved the fierce and cool Duan Ge.
 

 
Some loved the aloof and solitary Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Some love the enchanting Consort Chen...
 

 
At this important moment, Tong Zhao only wanted to confess to herself.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ was a bold challenge for both me and Shi Qianqiu. I asked him: Iya isn’t a traditionally positive character. She has twisted and obsessive traits, both toward others and herself. The box office might not be so optimistic."
 

 
"Director Shi told me: 'It’s okay, you focus on making the audience like her, and I’ll make the audience like the movie.'"
 

 
"I want to thank Director Shi, thank Sun Sa, thank all the staff behind and in front of ‘Iya Myth’, my agent, and every friend from Zeshan. They gave ‘Iya’ a lot of financial support..."
 

 
The consciousness palace was very quiet.
 

 
There were many difficulties walking this path in the human world. Tong Zhao was always strict with herself, always wanting to do better, always striving for perfection. The admiration from her fans and the recognition of the box office made her very satisfied and happy, but at this moment, all she wanted was her own recognition.
 

 
She didn’t need to ask; she already knew her answer.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised the trophy, showing the reporters an impeccable winning smile, and softly said in her heart:
 

 
*Thank you all.*
 

 
The applause was thunderous.

TN: The main text is over, there are still 8 extra chapters.
# Chapter135: Extras on Love (1) – Shi Qianqiu I Married Tong Zhao...
The night had fallen.
 

 
At the after-party for the Huaying Awards, Tong Zhao was still surrounded by a crowd. Though she maintained a polite social distance, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the circle of people around her was made up of several layers, given the typically reserved and dignified nature of these celebrities. Photographers moved through the crowd, and the flashes of cameras occasionally landed on her expensive dress, making it sparkle and shine.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stood beside her, gallantly blocking drinks for her.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s status, she was never the type of person to be toyed with by the powerful and wealthy. Therefore, the toasts were mostly short and polite, not meant to make her uncomfortable or embarrass her. However, after a while, she remained curious: "I didn’t expect you to have such a good tolerance for alcohol."
 

 
"Drinking is part of the fun," Shi Qianqiu turned his face toward her, flashing a smile. "Anything that’s fun, I’m good at."
 

 
Beneath his refined and cultured appearance was a deep, unfathomable darkness, which made Tong Zhao feel a little uneasy. She turned to Sun Sa and said, "You asked me how I’ve managed to stay true to myself in the entertainment industry before? Just don’t follow his example."
 

 
"Don’t falsely accuse me. I’ve been like this since elementary school—this is what staying true to oneself really looks like."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s words were soft, but it seemed like he sensed something. The smile on his lips deepened, and he gestured to a photographer in the distance. "Come take a photo, maybe give the ‘Shi-Zhao CP’ fans some perks?"
 

 
Tong Zhao found this a little strange.
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu didn’t care much about how others tried to pair him with people for the sake of fanfiction, apart from the last promotional event, he generally didn’t use this kind of thing to hype up his popularity—he found it beneath him.
 

 
What kind of wind was this?
 

 
However, when the photographer smiled and walked over, Tong Zhao still allowed the gesture, as she felt she should give her friend face. Shi Qianqiu casually wrapped his arm around her waist—not actually holding her, just making a show of their close relationship.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled as she flashed a smile at the photographer.
 

 
With a flash of light, the photographer complimented her:
 

 
"Xiao Zhao, you look really beautiful tonight!"
 

 
"The stylist put a lot of effort into it," Tong Zhao said modestly, her expression calm.
 

 
"Your hair is messy."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised his hand and tucked the stray hairs at her temples behind her ear.
 

 
To the onlookers, the two of them seemed incredibly close, their interaction so subtle that it was almost imperceptible.
 

 
As for the feelings of the parties involved… it was rather unsettling.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was pondering why Shi Qianqiu was being so considerate for no apparent reason, the "truth" walked over with a cold face:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, congratulations."
 

 
Wei Zekai had arrived midway through.
 

 
As the main person in charge of Zeshan, his job was just as demanding as Tong Zhao's. He often had to fly around for business trips, and with his father expecting him to inherit the family business, he was always under pressure. He had been delayed by a major business deal and had hurried to the Huaying party…
 

 
But he didn’t really have to rush.
 

 
He could meet Tong Zhao anytime.
 

 
Even if they couldn’t meet in person, he could always get her to answer a video call.
 

 
But after hearing that Tong Zhao had a good chance of winning, Wei Zekai decided to come in person. He was still in the car when the award ceremony was taking place, anxious to get there, and when he finally arrived, he saw the intimate scene between the two from a distance.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mood completely broke down at that moment.
 

 
For the past few days, Wei Zekai had been thinking about his feelings for Tong Zhao.
 

 
He hadn’t figured it out.
 

 
Or maybe he didn’t want to figure it out, fearing that if he did, they might not even be friends anymore.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her head toward Wei Zekai when she heard him speak, and Shi Qianqiu also lifted his gaze to look at him, flashing a provocative smile. Just as Tong Zhao happened to glance back at Shi Qianqiu, Director Shi immediately concealed his challenging expression and put on a refined, gentlemanly demeanor once again.
 

 
All of this was seen clearly by Wei Zekai—he understood it completely—
 

 
This guy really is no good!
 

 
"You’re here," Tong Zhao said, now understanding what Shi Qianqiu’s earlier actions had been about. She couldn’t help but laugh a little. She knew how busy Xiao Kai was, and he had actually managed to make it to the venue. She immediately gave him the second most sincere smile of the night: "You rushed here right after getting off the plane?"
 

 
"I changed clothes."
 

 
It was too rushed. Wei Zekai hadn’t had time to style himself carefully, but his looks were still good enough to carry him through. He wasn’t any less handsome than Sun Sa. Plus, his experience in the business world had given him a more mature aura. He had the vigor of youth, but also the depth of a mature man. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, slightly furrowing his brow. The photographer, who had been about to leave, was delighted to see Wei Zekai and immediately turned back to take another picture.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I’ll be in it too."
 

 
The photographer, of course, didn’t mind.
 

 
With a flash of the camera, the three of them had a group photo.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious but kept his temper in check. Shi Qianqiu noticed that he was jealous and said to the photographer, "Make sure to send me a copy of the photo. It’s so meaningful."
 

 
After the photographer agreed and walked away, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but feel annoyed.
 

 
Meaningful? What a load of nonsense!
 

 
It should have been just him and Tong Zhao in the photo, not him being dragged into it.
 

 
The three of them walked to a quieter corner to talk. Tong Zhao asked him, "Meaningful?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gestured and said, "That group photo—doesn’t it look like the Chinese character 'niao’ (meaning annoyed or angry)? The meaning fits perfectly!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was from Guangdong, and Tong Zhao knew a little Cantonese. In Cantonese, "niao" means "angry," so he was making a pun at Wei Zekai's expense. Wei Zekai didn’t understand, but from the way Shi Qianqiu was talking, it was clear he wasn’t saying anything nice.
 

 
But then, to Tong Zhao’s surprise…
 

 
She seemed to enjoy it!
 

 
Wei Zekai had used Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) before and didn’t understand why some people complained that their partners didn’t notice the "green tea". He couldn’t understand what was so infuriating about it. Now, he completely got it. Shi Qianqiu knew how to use every chance to make Tong Zhao laugh or give him provocative looks whenever she wasn’t looking directly at him. And whenever she noticed, he would immediately switch to looking perfectly composed and self-assured, making Wei Zekai angry but unable to expose it.
 

 
So manipulative!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, the master of "green tea"!
 

 
Just then, someone came up to Tong Zhao to invite her for a group photo. She said, "I’ll be back in a moment."
 

 
That left the two men staring at each other.
 

 
This should have been an awkward scene, but Shi Qianqiu wasn’t bothered. He casually took a sip of champagne, completely at ease.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "The movie we worked on together won her her first Best Actress award."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re childhood sweethearts."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re business partners in Zeshan."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress..." He dragged out the "s" at the end.
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t get it. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, who explained, "Best Actress ‘s’, the plural form. Don’t you know English? I can bring her many Best Actress awards in the future."
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought to himself, no wonder Tong Zhao was so tolerant of him—teasing him was just too fun. He was a lot like his younger brother, though his brother was a bit more obedient and serious. Watching Wei Zekai getting so worked up, unable to come up with a response, was quite amusing. He was curious to see what kind of big move Wei Zekai would come up with.
 

 
After a while, he heard Wei Zekai say:
 

 
"If you're not good to her, I won't let you off the hook."
 

 
...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised an eyebrow, genuinely surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew the two had a close relationship. Given their intimate interaction just now and the subtle aura of a "main wife" Shi Qianqiu was giving off, he had completely misunderstood. Although he didn't think Shi Qianqiu was a good person, as long as Tong Zhao liked him, he trusted her judgment and choices. Even though it felt like his heart was being squeezed, he didn’t try to deny their relationship.
 

 
The light fell on his proud brows and eyes, looking both dejected and defiant—his youthful energy practically radiating from him.
 

 
What is youthful energy, if not loving someone you can't have?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found himself momentarily lost in thought, watching him.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought Shi Qianqiu was silent because he didn’t believe him, so he continued, “Tong Zhao might seem strong, but she hasn’t gone through much hardship. She's actually very delicate. You can’t just assume that because she’s independent, you don’t need to pamper her.” He went on to talk about her picky eating habits, her gaming preferences, and what gifts she liked to receive…
 

 
Forced to listen to his partner’s unsolicited advice, Shi Qianqiu snapped back to reality and said, “Alright, when Tong Zhao and I get married, remember to come be my best man.”
 

 
A huge question mark appeared over Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
“You’re going too far!”
 

 
“Aren’t you good friends? Is it too much to ask you to be my best man?” Shi Qianqiu asked knowingly.
 

 
This left Wei Zekai speechless.
 

 
Yes, what’s the big deal?
 

 
Wei Zekai lowered his gaze slightly, his thoughts slowly becoming clearer.
 

 
But it was too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found his expression so amusing. He had heard that Wei Zekai and his younger brother were good friends, so why didn’t his younger brother invite him over earlier? Ah, it was a case of "better late than never."
 

 
He swirled his wine glass and, with a tone full of feigned sentimentality, said, "Don’t worry, I’ll treat her well."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s acting skills were truly impressive.
 

 
Wei Zekai believed him, feeling both relieved and heartbroken.
 

 
What reassured him was that Shi Qianqiu didn’t seem to be playing with Tong Zhao, that he wasn’t toying with her emotions. What saddened him was that he always felt he could treat Tong Zhao better, but he had arrived too late…
 

 
No, it wasn’t that he was late.
 

 
It was that he realized it a bit too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked, “Aren’t you unwilling to accept this?”
 

 
“A bit,” Wei Zekai muttered. “It’s not your fault. I always thought I had more time with her. I didn’t want to change the status quo. I was afraid that if I changed anything, I might lose her.”
 

 
Familiarity, in love, isn’t always a good thing.
 

 
Although he didn’t fully understand their story, someone as perceptive as Shi Qianqiu had probably figured out most of it from his few words…
 

 
A warm smile curved on the corner of his lips.
 

 
“It’s okay, I’ll treat her well on your behalf.”
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she saw Wei Zekai looking all gloomy and Shi Qianqiu looking particularly pleased.
 

 
She wasn’t sure what had happened, but it was probably something to do with being bullied.
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed, “Don’t bully him.”
 

 
This sweet interaction…
 

 
Wei Zekai felt even more heartbroken hearing that.
 

 
“I didn’t bully him,” Shi Qianqiu replied. “I just think he has a rare youthful energy. I want to invite him to act in my next movie.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was speaking the truth. In the entertainment industry, it was rare to find someone as handsome, with such a noble and youthful aura: “I’m going to take another walk. You two talk. Oh, and by the way, remember to come to my wedding.”
 

 
Wei Zekai almost wanted to curse.
 

 
He glanced at Tong Zhao and held back.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. “He’s getting married?”
 

 
She hadn’t heard that he had a girlfriend.
 

 
Since they’d met, Shi Qianqiu had always been single, and she wasn’t that familiar with Wei Zekai either. So, she couldn’t help but be curious. “Are you going to his wedding? Who is he marrying?”
 

 
As soon as she asked, she saw the look of disbelief on Wei Zekai’s face as he stared at her.
 

 
That look in his eyes was like a little dog that had just been kicked by its owner, utterly stunned.
# Chapter136: Emotional Extra (2) You Need to Wake Up Before I Can Have My Say...
Wei Zekai didn’t want to talk to her and started sulking.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other, like in a game—one signal, and Tong Zhao would know exactly what he meant. It was the same this time. As the party was nearing its end, they had long passed the stage where minor conflicts needed to be addressed on the spot. Tong Zhao decided to wait until they were heading home before discussing it.
 

 
After the party ended, Wei Zekai took a detour and had his driver take a cab back. He shamelessly parked next to Tong Zhao’s chauffeur-driven car, standing there silently.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing. "Let’s send them back. I’ll ride with Xiao Kai."
 

 
Her team members, tight-lipped and not ones to ask many questions, had their curiosity piqued, their eyes lighting up with gossip. Tong Zhao didn’t explain much and climbed into Wei Zekai’s car. Most likely, knowing she’d need a ride home, he didn’t have the driver bring out his flashy sports car today. Instead, he chose a low-key, comfortable business car—sports cars, with their focus on speed and appearance, often sacrificed passenger comfort.
 

 
The car was very quiet.
 

 
The car’s air freshener gave off a faint lemon scent, fresh but not overpowering.
 

 
Tong Zhao changed out of her off-shoulder dress, removed her heavy makeup, and applied just a light touch of powder. She looked even younger than when she dazzled on stage. Wei Zekai glanced at her. At first glance, she seemed no different from when they were in school.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was a pampered little princess who had never experienced the harsh realities of the world, but she was well-mannered…
 

 
She was the best girl Wei Zekai had ever known.
 

 
The car stopped at a red light. It began to rain lightly outside, and the raindrops blurred the streetlights that fell on her face, casting a shadow of freckles across her nose.
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke softly, "Zekai..."
 

 
Wei Zekai spoke first, "Are you really going to marry Shi Qianqiu?"
 

 
...
 

 
The bride is me!?
 

 
Tong Zhao had thought of many ridiculous answers, but she never imagined it would land on her. Her face showed a look of confusion.
 

 
Seeing that she didn't respond, Wei Zekai felt a bitterness in his heart—he had just thought Shí Qiānqiū was a master of tea arts, but the true "green tea" was actually him. Shi Qianqiu was Tong Zhao’s real boyfriend. The words hit his heart like a hammer, bitter like lotus seed paste. If this were happening to Shi Qianqiu or Jiang Dang, they would have acted the moment they realized their feelings, not caring whether the other party was about to get married or not...
 

 
But Wei Zekai cared.
 

 
Even if there was a one in a thousand chance that Tong Zhao would choose him, he didn’t want her to become someone who betrayed her partner.
 

 
He was willing to be the shameless person who pined for a married woman.
 

 
But he didn’t want her character to be tarnished in the slightest.
 

 
The comfortable business car had become a cage. At that moment, Wei Zekai wished he could be in his sports car, ignoring everything, pressing the accelerator to the floor, going at a speed of eight hundred miles per hour, with his mood as bright as the sun... But unfortunately, he couldn’t. This car could also go fast, but with Tong Zhao sitting in the passenger seat, he didn’t want to scare her.
 

 
Just as the poor puppy was about to burst into tears, Tong Zhao cleared her throat and said, "I’m not marrying him. We’re not even dating. We’re just friends. He was just teasing you, and you fell for it."
 

 
She then took out her phone to strengthen her argument and sent a message to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [When are we having the wedding?]
 

 
Shí Qianqiu: [Hahahahaha!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Shall we go get the marriage license tomorrow?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’m afraid Wei Zekai will kill me. I’ve already booked the fastest flight to Hawaii tonight.]
 

 
Wow, he’s off to play again. Truly carefree.
 

 
"… Huh?"
 

 
Hearing that voice full of confusion, Tong Zhao finally remembered that there was a silly boy beside her who had been completely fooled: "How long have I been gone? And you already believe that I’m getting married? I don’t know if I should say he’s too good at lying or you’re just too easy to fool."
 

 
"… Oh.”
 

 
Amidst great sorrow and joy, Wei Zekai was stunned into a fool who could only respond with single words.
 

 
After arriving at Yu Long Xuan, Wei Zekai parked the car in his own small garage—because the homeowners here usually own more than one car, many of them buy the garage together with the property.
 

 
Wei Zekai also owned property here and would occasionally be neighbors with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was only "occasionally" because they didn’t get much time off at the same time, so they didn’t often have the chance to rest at home together.
 

 
"So..."
 

 
The garage was brightly lit, the lights spilling into the car, warming half of his face. His eyes were bright and gleaming, like a stray dog that had just realized it wasn’t abandoned: "You’re still single?"
 

 
"Always have been."
 

 
Seeing that he still had something to say, Tong Zhao didn’t rush to get out of the car.
 

 
Even though it was comfortable, the car was still an enclosed space. In such a quiet environment, the sensitivity to emotions was magnified, and Tong Zhao could feel the tension in the air, making her throat feel dry.
 

 
To Tong Zhao, Wei Zekai had always been the image of a harmless, soft big dog.
 

 
Of course, if she said that aloud, no one would believe it. Wei Zekai without aggression? He was the most proud and unruly second-generation heir in this circle, the hardest to deal with. Ever since he started a serious business and began making money, he frequently snatched projects from older industry veterans. It wasn’t until he became more enlightened that he realized the Wèi family hadn’t invested in him for nothing; he truly had the skills.
 

 
But in front of Tong Zhao, he was just a big goofy dog wagging his tail.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai was staring straight ahead at nothing, his lips tightly pressed together, his eyes shining.
 

 
Suddenly, he turned his head to her: "So you don’t like him?"
 

 
After their eyes met, she smiled first:
 

 
"I do like him in a friendship way, but I never thought about dating him. As for the future, I wouldn’t deny that it’s possible. After all, he’s a very charming man."
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled that her highest admiration for Shi Qianqiu came when they worked together on a film project. A versatile, multi-talented partner, someone who had both aesthetic sense and talent—who wouldn’t like that? It even created the illusion of mutual respect, wanting to spend a lifetime together. But after the work was finished, that feeling gradually faded.
 

 
"I don't want that possibility," Wei Zekai quickly interrupted her.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Wei Zekai stared at her intently.
 

 
He could feel his heartbeat racing, so fast it seemed to merge into one, his chest muscles nearly burning with the intensity, making his emotions surge. He wasn’t the kind of person who got muddled or unclear; he just hadn’t realized before, hadn’t experienced it, and didn’t know that every time he saw Tong Zhao, it was because he liked her.
 

 
That feeling was something more than brotherly affection.
 

 
When had it changed?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s light-colored eyes reflected his tense, almost stiff face. It didn’t seem particularly graceful, but he oddly liked the feeling of filling her field of vision and wanted to keep it that way, as if he had finally figured out the right approach to a problem. The difficult puzzle that once made no sense to him suddenly became clear. His feelings for Tong Zhao hadn’t changed; perhaps, perhaps it had been that way from the very beginning…
 

 
"We first met at school. I was playing basketball, and the ball accidentally got hit out of bounds."
 

 
"You were wearing a school skirt, looking so gentle and graceful, I was really afraid the ball would hit you, but then you..."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed to be recounting the story of how they met in a disjointed manner.
 

 
For him, it was something that had happened a few years ago.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, however, it felt like a memory from a past life, something she could only slowly recall from his narration.
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been athletic, and when she heard his loud warning, she easily caught the basketball, giving him an amused glance. "Xu Zhu was surprised you apologized and thanked me. She said you looked down on everyone and didn’t hang out with girls. She thought your attitude toward me would be really bad.”
 

 
"Right, you two were still good friends back then."
 

 
Wei Zekai said, "I remembered you from that moment."
 

 
Their families weren’t in the same class financially—Wei family’s wealth was far above everyone else's—while the school they attended was a well-known private institution with sky-high tuition fees. Despite the difference in their backgrounds, the two of them surprisingly became familiar with each other. In terms of family background, Wei Zekai was naturally stronger, but in the eyes of their classmates, Tong Zhao was the unattainable, high mountain flower. She had inherited the beauty of her actress mother and had a natural leadership charisma that cared for others in her conversations.
 

 
At that time, these were just potentials.
 

 
She was impressive in school, but once she entered the real world, it wasn’t enough. And back then, Tong Zhao hadn’t had the chance to slowly nurture that potential. She was knocked down by a series of misfortunes... until a fortunate encounter gave her the opportunity to cultivate those small seeds into towering trees across many worlds, which led to the Tong Zhao we know now.
 

 
Tong Zhao was lost in the memories he described.
 

 
Ever since she returned from the quick-travel worlds, she hadn’t allowed Xu Zhu to appear in her line of sight, but before her travels, Xu Zhu was indeed a good friend who had grown up with her.
 

 
If she were to hide "Xu Zhu" in her memories, the person who would take up the most space would be Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had tried countless times to pull himself out of the mire, but back then, they were both so stubborn and loved to argue. The words they spoke to each other were hurtful...
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "It seems like I was really lucky the day I met you."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was just about to muster the courage to confess, was hit with a blow.
 

 
The feeling was like being fed sugar by a master.
 

 
"Is... is that so? You're really polite, good buddy."
 

 
He got too shy and couldn’t express himself clearly.
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Wei Zekai realized he couldn’t keep calling her "buddy." He gripped the steering wheel, swallowed hard, and his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
"I’ve figured it out."
 

 
"I've liked you from the very beginning.”
 

 
"It's not the kind of liking that friends have, and I don't want to be just a brother."
 

 
"I want to be your boyfriend."
 

 
It was too shy.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew that when he thought too much, things tended to go wrong. So, he simply shut off the connection between his brain and his heart, and everything he had been hiding inside, he laid bare for Tong Zhao to see.
 

 
Each word was unthought-out but carried the feelings that had settled in his heart for a long, long time.
 

 
Long enough that in the previous life, he never had the chance to say it.
 

 
After he said everything he needed to say, the sensor light turned off, as there had been no movement for a while. The only light left in the car was the interior car light, casting shadows that deepened the handsome contours of Wei Zekai's face, making them hard to discern.
 

 
"...Hmm, I guessed it."
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
If she had really been surprised, her emotional intelligence would be on the same level as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
Her thoughts drifted far away, remembering how in her past life, she too had been an innocent fool without any experience in relationships. She and Wei Zekai had a huge argument, though she couldn’t remember the reason. She told him to get lost, that she didn’t need him to care. Could a friend care for a lifetime? He got angry and said, "So what if I want to care for a lifetime? I’m Wei Zekai. I can care for you all my life." The words sounded very childish, but looking back, it was probably mixed with love, even if she didn’t understand it at the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, her lips curling. "Being stupid is really a sin."
 

 
"...?"
 

 
Wei Zekai, the confused little puppy, didn’t understand if he was being scolded.
 

 
Being stupid means not understanding. Not understanding means missing out.
 

 
And once something is missed, it’s gone forever.
 

 
This wasn’t funny.
 

 
Wei Zekai grew anxious. "No, don't think I’m stupid. Actually, I’m quite smart." He brought up some of the recent projects he had successfully completed, afraid that Tong Zhao would misunderstand and reject his confession because she thought he was foolish.
 

 
"I didn’t say you’re stupid, I just remembered one thing I didn’t finish," Tong Zhao said, raising her hand. Her cool fingertips touched his cheek, then she grabbed his wrist and leaned in to kiss him.
 

 
"You made me a little unhappy because you took so long to figure it out, little puppy.”
# Chapter137: Emotional Extra (3) Pampering Zhao Zhao
A long, lingering kiss.
 

 
Wei Zekai remembered the time when they were filming ‘Sea King Killer’. They had shared a kiss like this before, one that he spent many nights thinking about before he could finally push it from his mind. Back then, he had felt that his brotherly feelings for Tong Zhao were beginning to change, which he thought was wrong. It was something from a long time ago, something he had thought he had completely forgotten. But when their lips met, that familiar sensation rushed back vividly.
 

 
This time, it wasn't for a movie, it was real life.
 

 
One of his wrists was held by her, and he could only use his other hand to gently pull her by the back of the head, deepening the kiss.
 

 
So this is what kissing feels like?
 

 
It wasn't the sweetness described in novels. Wei Zekai tasted the flavor of lipstick on her lips. More than the warmth of her skin, it was the temperature of their mucous membranes, the tension in their lips and tongues entwining. He forgot to close his eyes and even saw her long, curled eyelashes, delicate like a doll. He felt a thrill as if he were doing something bad—he had always wanted to do this with his good friend, to kiss her, to know the taste of her tongue.
 

 
When they pulled apart, Tong Zhao's pupils were slightly darker. She asked him, "What are you thinking?"
 

 
"I..." Wei Zekai, his mind blank, curved his lips, now smeared with lipstick. "What should we name our kids?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao reminded him, "Let me educate you—kissing doesn't make you pregnant."
 

 
"...I know! I was just nervous!"
 

 
Wei Zekai shot her a reproachful look, then furrowed his brows, feeling that the situation was more complicated than he thought. "Do you just want to play with me, or don't you want to marry me?"
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Tong Zhao also couldn't understand why, in this day and age, someone would think about marriage just after a single kiss. The car had the heater on, the air was a bit stuffy, and after their passionate kiss, Wei Zekai's face was flushed, making his usual bold, unruly expression soften with an inexplicable shyness.
 

 
The more she looked at him, the cuter he seemed, and her lips involuntarily curved into a smile.
 

 
This smile, however, drove Wei Zekai crazy.
 

 
"What's so funny?! I'm really good at this!"
 

 
Confident in his skills, Wei Zekai kissed her again with lightning speed. She had previously grabbed his wrist, so he now grabbed her waist and the back of her neck, kissing her fiercely. The description of it is not appropriate...
 

 
But actually, it wasn’t that bad.
 

 
The car was cramped, and she could feel the almost scorching warmth of his lips and tongue, along with his sharp canine brushing against her tongue, making her feel like she'd been nibbled on by a dog.
 

 
When Wei Zekai had had enough, she gently pushed him away. He only loosened the kiss but still awkwardly held onto her in an uncomfortable position.
 

 
Tong Zhao honestly expressed her feelings.
 

 
Wei Zekai, embarrassed and angry, retorted:
 

 
"Fine, I'm a dog! I used to be wild, but now I'm domesticated. You better keep me on a leash."
 

 
Tong Zhao was amused by his clumsy attitude, and with a deep smile, she responded, "Okay," while hooking her hand around the back of his neck and gently pulling him closer:
 

 
"Good boy."
 

 
＊
 

 
Tong Zhao’s relationship wasn’t something to be taken lightly, and she wasn’t just playing around with Wei Zekai; she was serious about their relationship. So, how to make it public became a priority on their agenda. Her team held a meeting for an entire day to come up with a public relations strategy, which felt absurd and unreal.
 

 
But it was necessary.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had been involved in a few scandals in the past, all of which had been cleared up, and since she and Wei Zekai were childhood friends and business partners, the public was already sensitive to them being seen together. Only some fans who supported their relationship would say they’d just gotten another dose of "new sugar."
 

 
Considering his girlfriend’s public relations needs, Wei Zekai behaved quite well. After confirming their relationship, he acted no differently than before.
 

 
Work was still work, and play was still play.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a little surprised.
 

 
Her team began to drop subtle hints, bringing their gossip back into the public eye.
 

 
A marketing account commented on the compatibility between Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, and netizens began to realize just how much this handsome second-generation rich young man had improved since his role in ‘Sea King Killer’. People tend to be more lenient when it comes to characters they've watched grow over the years, and as they spoke of him, their impressions became more positive. Additionally, the Wei family had always been generous with charity under the name of their only son, creating an image of a socially conscious genius entrepreneur.
 

 
Wei Zekai rummaged through old boxes and handed some photos from their middle and high school days to the public relations team.
 

 
With the hype being deliberately stirred up, public opinion became increasingly loud.
 

 
Industry professionals with a sharp sense had already guessed that she was likely to go public with her relationship.
 

 
Every media outlet was eager to get exclusive information about Tong Zhao’s love life.
 

 
However, ever since she won the award for ‘Iya Myth’, the usually low-key actress had only taken on a few high-profile commercial events. The latest variety show she had filmed wouldn’t air for another two months, so there was no way to catch her.
 

 
A few days later, the couple at the center of the gossip finally made a statement.
 

 
They didn't give any media outlet an exclusive, instead, they both posted on Weibo.
 

 
Wei Zekai wrote a long post, recalling sweet memories from their time together, from their middle school photos to game screenshots, to their in-game relationships in ‘King of Glory’ and ‘League of Legends’, photos with their in-game characters, screenshots of their duos in ‘PUBG’, their signatures on one of the Zeshan project contracts, and proof of his investment in Tong Zhao’s film project.
 

 
Their lives had been intertwined with traces of each other, and they had finally come together.
 

 
This official announcement, with its smooth, inevitable tone, was sweet enough to melt many people.
 

 
What moved netizens the most was the final paragraph of Wei Zekai’s post:
 

 
[I’ve known since the day I was born that I’d never have to worry about food or drink. I didn’t know what was good or what was bad.]
 

 
[Being proactive? If where I stand is the finish line, what direction should I take to move forward? It wasn’t until I met that girl who almost got hit by my basketball. She caught my mistake, smiled at me, and generously forgave me. Since then, I started paying attention to everything about Tong Zhao. From that moment on, my life had a source of light, and I no longer felt lost. As long as I stay close to her and move in her direction, I’m moving forward.]
 

 
[My life’s motivation is to become more worthy of her.]
 

 
Wei Zekai also shared a puzzle piece.
 

 
One side of the puzzle was a photo of Tong Zhao smiling with her Huaying Award trophy, while the other side was a photo that netizens had never seen before—a candid shot from her high school days, holding a certificate on stage. From the angle, it seemed like Wei Zekai had secretly taken the picture from below the stage with his phone.
 

 
In his eyes, she was always the most dazzling presence.
 

 
With the groundwork already laid, the comments were unsurprisingly supportive. Fans’ basic comments included reminders for him to treat Tong Zhao well, while the rest of the popular comments were more typical:
 

 
[Childhood sweethearts with a fairy tale romance!!!!!!]
 

 
[Men who can write little essays are so rare, ‘sob sob sob’, I feel like I’m in the civil affairs bureau!]
 

 
[I saw the date they linked their couple relationship, so you really weren’t together before? Oh my gosh, you guys are truly best friends.]
 

 
Compared to the male side’s announcement, the female side’s official post was as simple as a steel straight guy’s tweet—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 
This time, I didn’t miss it. @Wei Zekai
 

 
There wasn’t even a picture attached.
 

 
The caption was written by Tong Zhao herself, and the team respected her decision. As for the lack of pictures, they couldn’t decide on what to use during the meeting—couple photos were too mushy, items like matching game controllers, limited edition sneakers, luxury cars, or clothes were all rejected. At one point, Wei Zekai even suggested a matching private jet, but that was also turned down.
 

 
So, they chose no pictures over pictures, letting netizens slowly figure it out, which suited her style.
 

 
That is, personal matters were not to be displayed to the public.
 

 
What does “didn’t miss it” mean?
 

 
It sounds a bit painful.
 

 
Some netizens went to ask Wei Zekai on his Weibo, but he didn’t respond, because he honestly didn’t know either.
 

 
The real answer could only be known by Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Netizens were dying of curiosity, eager to know how a fairy-tale couple like them dated—however, the reality was harsh. The obscure, indifferent, 18th-tier celebrities tried to ride the trending search by showing off their love, while the internationally renowned actress and her billionaire boyfriend remained so low-key that even their couple photos were rarely leaked.
 

 
This was supposed to be the sweet, honeymoon phase after confirming their relationship!
 

 
No couple photos?
 

 
No cute daily love moments?
 

 
Not appearing together on variety shows?
 

 
So how exactly does this fairy-tale couple date?
 

 
Tong Zhao was wrong.
 

 
She was really wrong.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously thought that Wei Zekai was very calm about dating, since they were already familiar with each other. What hadn't they done besides kissing, hugging, and holding hands? At the time, she admired him and thought that Zekai had a broad perspective. However, since officially announcing their relationship and receiving the recognition and status from Tong Zhao’s PR team—“Now that you've publicly announced, you can freely enjoy your sweet romance”—Wei Zekai had lifted the seal.
 

 
After getting Tong Zhao’s consent, Wei Zekai secretly moved into her house—after all, she had plenty of guest rooms, and the security and privacy at Yu Long Xuan (the name of the estate) were more than sufficient to guarantee his safety. Even when he was single, many people knew that they were neighbors living in the same community.
 

 
Next came the couple avatars and couple signatures on all their gaming and social media accounts.
 

 
All the games.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind about game IDs—just a random string of characters. Some of her accounts even had randomly typed gibberish as IDs. So, she allowed him to do it: "I’m too lazy to go change them one by one. You know the passwords, you do it."
 

 
A few days later, when she logged into the game during the break, she saw the group named: (Spoiling Zhao Zhao).
 

 
The personal signature read: [Playing King of Glory for Zhao Zhao].
 

 
Tong Zhao: "..."
 

 
Thank you, that’s a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Her gibberish ID was also changed to "Zhao Zhao."
 

 
Short IDs like this were quite expensive, but things that had a price tag weren’t a problem for Wei Zekai. If it could be bought, he’d just get it.
 

 
And this was just the beginning.
 

 
Tong Zhao's entire gaming profile seemed to have become a collection of online couple IDs, with all sorts of styles. There were also dedicated groups, and from them, it was clear that Wei Zekai had labeled himself as [Husband], [Boyfriend], [Baby], [Sweetheart], [Bodyguard]... The list went on.
 

 
In the past, when they played together, Wei Zekai would want to team up with her as their duo.
 

 
Now, when they played together, Wei Zekai would say: "Baby, put Yao Yao on my head."
 

 
Tong Zhao, the gold medal mage, responded with a question mark.
 

 
The wild king from before quickly backed down: "Then I'll play Yao Yao and put her on your head."
 

 
That was much better.
 

 
The family dynamics were simple, clear, and straightforward.
 

 
And then later…
 

 
When the Zeshan team played together, they were shocked to discover that the former wild area mad dog not only had a fully leveled support character but was also calling out in voice chat: "Baby, come meet me at the fountain." "I don’t want to go home alone, come pick me up." And, "That marksman just hit me, go and kill him!"
 

 
He even sent heart gestures to Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was terrifying! How had they never noticed that Wei Zekai had this tough yet tender side?
 

 
The key was, he was having so much fun with it.
 

 
Whenever their opponents called him a "green tea Yao," he would proudly hang Yao on the mid-lane, showing off.
 

 
[All] Zhao Zhao: I spoiled him.
# Chapter138: Variety Show Extra (1)
What’s it like to have your idol explode in popularity?
 

 
Endless schedules, being able to see your idol's heavenly beauty every day, no longer needing to explain who your favorite star is in the vast sea of celebrities, not having to worry about your idol lacking resources, just having to worry about whether you can keep up with it all...
 

 
It’s so blissful.
 

 
Basically, every fan of a reality show contestant dreams of the day when they can make it alongside their idol.
 

 
But what’s it like when your idol becomes a film queen?
 

 
You can get a glimpse from the comments under Tong Zhao’s Weibo.
 

 
[Sis, can you appear on some variety shows? Even a livestream for sales would be fine, or a gaming stream? I miss you, sis.]
 

 
[Skip the sales, just go on more variety shows.]
 

 
[When was the last time we saw you in public? Oh, it was when you were hosting the charity auction gala, Little Zhāo.]
 

 
[Only shows at that level can afford to invite Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[6 tears, want to see a couple’s variety show, want to see you dominate the trending searches!]
 

 
Looking back, it feels like Tong Zhao’s debut was just yesterday.
 

 
Fans miss those days so much. Every movie would have variety shows in between, and she’d frequently make appearances.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao never really followed the idol path; it was just that her superstar aura was too strong. Not only did she have great works, but she also attracted fans, who worshiped her like a goddess. Since Tong Zhao won the Best Actress award at the Huaying Awards for ‘Iya Myth’, her crown became even more solid. She quickly became known as a top actress… which also meant that, unless absolutely necessary, her public exposure was reduced.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had already passed the stage where she needed excessive exposure.
 

 
Fans could only wait endlessly.
 

 
Fans from other fandoms, hearing their own idols complain, couldn’t help but feel a bit of the ‘Versailles’ effect — their own idol would be overjoyed just to get a supporting role in a big production, fighting tooth and nail over that minor role, and debating for days and nights over secondary billing, but Tong Zhao? She had a top-tier team serving her, and as long as she nodded, hundreds of millions in investments would fall into place. No matter which set she joined, she would be guaranteed the lead role, and no one could take it from her.
 

 
Isn’t that unfair?
 

 
It ‘is’ unfair, but fans also just really want to see more of Tong Zhao…
 

 
With nothing to do, fans would comment under Wei Zekai's Weibo, asking him not to hide his girlfriend and urging him to let Zhao take on more variety shows and appear more often.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied to this lucky fan’s comment: [Do you think I have a say in her acting career?]
 

 
[...That makes sense.]
 

 
[The family hierarchy is pretty clear.]
 

 
[How about some couple photos to show off?]
 

 
Not long after, the fan received a game screenshot.
 

 
The fans collectively sighed in frustration.
 

 
They wanted to see ‘actual’ photos of her!
 

 
And even if it was a screenshot, it was of Wei Zekai playing the cute support character, Yao, while Tong Zhao was playing Shanguan Wan'er, coldly poking her way through the mid-lane, as if saying, “Do you think you’re worthy of lining up against me?” It was incredibly cool.
 

 
@Wei Zekai: [You all ask for so much [couple photos]]
 

 
The photo was newly taken, showing Tong Zhao in black loungewear sitting on the couch, flipping through documents. Half of her long, fair legs were visible, and her side profile was delicate and cold, exuding a strong, professional woman aura. Meanwhile, Wei Zekai wore a coral fleece pajama with a monster design, making a peace sign next to her, his handsome smile carrying a hint of pride.
 

 
...
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai was reading the comments under his Weibo post with the couple photo.
 

 
"Can't say they're a match made in heaven, just that they're completely mismatched."
 

 
"Where are they mismatched? You have no taste!"
 

 
"Hey, that's not bad, the little monster and its tamer! Sounds a bit suggestive."
 

 
Wei Zekai scrolled down and saw a comment with a lot of likes and replies that kept increasing. Curious, he clicked on it, and...
 

 
A fan had used a Q-version watermelon sticker to cover Wei Zekai's head in the couple photo, turning the couple's picture into a solo shot of Tong Zhao. Other fans were delighted, and the "objectified" Wei Zekai, with an ellipsis on his forehead, was dramatically depicted as the little monster pouting on the sofa, looking up at the owner of the house—Tong Zhao, who was flipping through documents. The caption read, "Baby, your fans are bullying me, aren't you going to do something about it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had been nudged slightly into the sofa, grabbed his neck with one hand and said, "Not enough fun, do you want me to join in and bully you too?"
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Well, it's not like it's impossible."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "Watch the limits."
 

 
The little monster huffed and pouted.
 

 
"Forget it, let's stop looking," Tong Zhao tossed the documents onto the coffee table and snuggled into his fluffy pajama-clad chest. "I'm a bit tired of looking."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had been acting like a little puppy, immediately switched back to his usual tone, dropping the boyish voice. He held her in his arms and gently patted her back, as if soothing a child. "You can wait for me, I'll go over the important points with you once I finish. Don't waste your energy; didn't you read a bunch of scripts the past few days?"
 

 
Tong Zhao softly hummed, her low voice betraying a kind of exhaustion she usually kept hidden from the outside world: "You help me look at it."
 

 
"Okay, baby."
 

 
Helping his girlfriend look over the documents!
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a sense of accomplishment, as though all his hard work in studying was meant for this moment.
 

 
Thanks to her cultivation, Tong Zhao usually had great stamina and mental energy. She rarely felt tired and was even known as a "iron woman" in the industry. But ever since she started dating Wei Zekai, during these private moments of being alone together, these psychological fatigue feelings popped up like mushrooms after a rain, making her want to whine and complain to her boyfriend... Something she never would have imagined doing before.
 

 
Was it because love made her weaker?
 

 
Later, Tong Zhao reflected on her own feelings and realized that after a little whining and complaining during their dates, she felt more energized and focused on her work.
 

 
Consort Chen joked: "As long as you're not a true immortal, everyone needs a place for their emotions to rest."
 

 
It was okay to be a little more forgiving with herself. There was nothing wrong with that.
 

 
Compared to a truly clingy and sweet wife, Tong Zhao was rather cold-natured. Every time she took the initiative for a kiss or a hug, Wei Zekai was as delighted as if he'd won the lottery... Actually, he was probably even happier than winning the lottery. After all, winning a couple of hundred thousand was just a small bonus for his wealth, while a warm hug from his girlfriend meant so much more.
 

 
"Enough hugging."
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head from his chest and gave a small smile: "I noticed you really like showing off your love."
 

 
Wei Zekai sighed:
 

 
"If it weren't for your team stopping me, I would have paid for a yearly membership on Weibo hot search, just so our sweet little love story could stay in the top ten forever."
 

 
He really wanted the whole world to know how happy he was to be in a relationship with Tong Zhao.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao could only say, good thing they stopped him.
 

 
However, what she actually wanted to say was something else:
 

 
"By the way, Sister Chu also wants me to take on a customized variety show… Let’s go on a variety show together."
 

 
"A couple's variety show?"
 

 
Wei Zekai was excited.
 

 
He didn't usually watch variety shows, but he couldn't resist when Tong Zhao's fans were constantly encouraging him on Weibo to appear on one with his girlfriend.
 

 
Whether it was a couple's show or not didn’t matter; he just wanted to see his girlfriend on screen.
 

 
Wei Zekai was, at most, a somewhat good-looking accessory, or a large decoration.
 

 
He’d wanted to do this for a long time.
 

 
But Wei Zekai had always been reluctant to pressure his girlfriend.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao had brought it up herself, it was a different story.
 

 
"…Okay."
 

 
What Wei Zekai didn’t notice was that Tong Zhao's "okay" came with a slight pause, carrying some hidden meaning. He was so excited about the idea of being on a variety show with Tong Zhao that his little monster tail almost seemed to be wagging in the air.
 

 
*
 

 
Wei Zekai's good mood lasted until he arrived at the filming set and saw his old rival.
 

 
"Why is it you again???"
 

 
"Hey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from Sanya, was wearing flashy beach shorts and a T-shirt, with frog-shaped glasses on his head. He was lounging with his legs crossed in an office chair, raising his hand to greet Wei Zekai. Wei Zekai immediately wanted to grab his girlfriend and leave, but then he heard Shi Qianqiu leisurely explain: "Tong Zhao wants to try a brand-new variety show format, and she asked me to direct it. She thinks I'm the one who understands the most about her most charming side."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow, looking like an irritated little leopard. "She has many sides that only I’ve seen."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu smiled. "Like what?"
 

 
"Like—"
 

 
Before he could finish the third word, Tong Zhao covered his mouth from behind.
 

 
Watching the couple was too amusing, Shi Qianqiu laughed out loud.
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly said, "Don't try to get him to talk."
 

 
There was a reason for bringing Shi Qianqiu in to direct.
 

 
Ever since confirming her relationship with Wei Zekai, the other personalities in Tong Zhao's inner world had frequently wanted to interact with him, which was essentially like meeting the parents. At that time, Tong Zhao had an idea—since in instinctive filming, her personalities could be modeled in different ways, maybe it would be possible to have all the personalities appear at once during the filming? She mentioned this idea to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
The answer was yes, but it would put a heavy burden on the actor’s brain. A doctor would need to evaluate her in advance to ensure safety before filming could begin.
 

 
Thus, she asked Shi Qianqiu to lower his status and take on the role of variety show director...
 

 
The first reason was that other directors wouldn’t dare take on the responsibility.
 

 
Secondly, it was because Shi Qianqiu truly understood the charm points of her different personalities.
 

 
Even though it was a very self-interested customized variety show, Tong Zhao still hoped the audience would like her other sides.
 

 
Consort Chen, Duan Ge, Shuyi, Zhao Zai, Lu Xianchang, Hanzhi, Iya, and Tong Zhao herself—these eight personalities together could be described as a group of talents. They could even form two full tables for mahjong, not at all lacking in numbers. A large portion of the variety show budget was spent on modeling, and it was only after confirming that Tong Zhao could support eight similar-looking but distinctly different subconscious personalities that they proceeded with the modeling.
 

 
The explanation for the public had already been planned out.
 

 
They would say that due to family changes, Tong Zhao had long been inclined to imagine herself experiencing various lives in different worlds. There are many people in the entertainment industry with mental health issues, and while Tong Zhao's case wasn't particularly new, creating such specific and varied subconscious personalities was indeed unique.
 

 
After getting rid of the disgruntled Wei Zekai and sending him off to prepare for the shooting capsule, Shi Qianqiu finally asked, "Did you tell him about the shooting content?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
"I guessed as much," Shi Qianqiu smiled and said, seeing through the situation immediately. "Looks like he thought it was a couples' variety show. No wonder he pulled that long face when he saw me. Well, you go ahead and get ready in the shooting room."
 

 
After Tong Zhao left, Shi Qianqiu reminisced about Wei Zekai's expression and couldn't help but smile more as he thought about it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was still young, after all.
 

 
He didn’t know that when shooting a variety show, the one person you must never offend is the director.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu considered himself magnanimous and wouldn’t purposely make things difficult for him, much less resort to malicious editing.
 

 
"Hey, the modeling team, come over here. Add a little tail and dog ears to the male lead."
 

 
After giving this thoughtful instruction, Shi Qianqiu bit into a refreshing, sweet, and crunchy red apple.
 

 
He couldn’t wait for the variety show to begin shooting.
# Chapter139: Variety Show Extras (2) — As Long As It's You, Tong Zhao, I Like It...
"Tong Zhao Confidential File - REAL" is a variety show in a live broadcast format.
 

 
Of course, it will also release a polished, edited version later through post-production.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the length of live broadcasts, the live version’s bullet screen comments (live viewer chat) tend to be sparse, and its topic popularity relatively low.
 

 
But that’s under normal circumstances.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, it is an unspoken rule: anything involving "Tong Zhao" must be approached with high expectations and premium standards. Yet, no matter how creative or bold their imaginations are, the actual outcomes often exceed them.
 

 
Just like "REAL"—
 

 
Before the live broadcast even started, the promotional teaser alone had already caused a sensation, breaking records by completely filling hundreds of viewing rooms. Another polished version of a variety show that aired on the same day was tragically ignored, relegated to obscurity, hoping viewers would someday remember to check out its replay. Not only did "REAL" secure the top spot in viewership rankings, but the gap between it and the second place was astronomically large.
 

 
This might just be the difference between legends and ordinary people!
 

 
---
 

 
The Promotional Teaser
 

 
- [I heard they’re modeling all of Tong Zhao’s subconscious types? This idea is crazy!]
 
- [It’s possible in theory, but barely achievable in practice.]
 
- [My idol count just multiplied by eight! My happiness multiplied by eight too!]
 
- [These fans are too wild! I suspect by the time I finish this show, I’ll have face blindness for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
Fans and netizens were already familiar with Tong Zhao’s different subconscious personas through her association’s official reports and Director Shi’s microfilms. So when this topic came up, they could vaguely imagine what it might look like.
 

 
Of course, there were also those simply enjoying this heavenly couple’s romantic variety show.
 

 
- [I want to see Tong Zhao get jealous of herself!!!]
 

 
- [Ah, is this a “Kai’s Harem Experience Card”?]
 
- [Finally, we can see them in the same frame. ‘crying in joy’]
 

 
Under the public’s eager anticipation, the pre-recorded promotional trailer began to play.
 

 
---
 

 
The first scene was an aerial shot—
 

 
Gentle sea breezes, towering mountain peaks stretching endlessly, and a luxurious castle nestled deep within a forest. At first glance, one might mistake it for a tourism documentary. With Shi Qianqiu's mastery of the camera, the sequence was stunningly picturesque.
 

 
However, the castle didn’t exude much warmth.
 

 
It was shrouded in dark clouds occasionally illuminated by flashes of lightning, appearing grayish and somewhat eerie.
 

 
---
 

 
[This instinctive variety show is a reality show of the heart.]
 
[Revealing the truest side of public figures.]
 

 
[So, what is the true nature of the famous actress Tong Zhao, known for her diverse subconscious personas? The production team has gone to great lengths to uncover her different sides—]
 

 
At this moment, the promotional video cut to a behind-the-scenes interview.
 

 
At the center of the screen was Shi Qianqiu, wearing sunglasses.
 

 
The comment section erupted with playful criticism:
 

 
- [Why is he wearing sunglasses indoors?]
 
- [And of course, it's the classic aviators.]
 
- [Let me hear the nonsense he's about to say.]
 

 
"It's honestly a hassle," Shi Qianqiu said with a tone that was both exasperated and full of admiration. "Tong Zhao, just how many surprises are you hiding from us?"
 

 
Once this statement was played, the footage quickly transitioned back to the castle interior.
 

 
As the comments speculated that Shi Qianqiu had only appeared to show off, the screen revealed a woman descending a spiral staircase lined with red carpet.
 

 
The castle’s interior was designed in a Western style, but the woman wore a traditional Eastern ceremonial dress. The fusion of East and West created an unexpectedly striking aesthetic. She appeared to be a youthful version of Tong Zhao, her delicate smile and the charm in her eyes effortlessly captivating the viewers.
 

 
It was Tong Zhao—anyone could tell at a glance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao rarely displayed such a charming and alluring expression. Only her most devoted fans could recall this signature demeanor from her cameo as the imperial concubine in ‘Emperor Ming’.
 

 
She exuded a seductive elegance, but it was clear to viewers that this wasn’t a woman to be casually disrespected or teased. As she faced the audience and curved her lips into a slight smile, a name and a brief introduction flashed onto the freeze-frame with dramatic "bang bang bang" sound effects:
 

 
[Consort Chen.
 
Tong Zhao once fantasized about traveling to a distant time and place, rising from obscurity to become the most favored Consort in the palace.]
 

 
To justify why each persona had such detailed backstories, Tong Zhao had to embrace a youthful, "cringe-worthy" phase of her imagination where her teenage self had an overactive imagination. After a moment of surprise, the audience burst into laughter:
 

 
- [Wait, this is a thing? I didn’t see that coming!]
 
- [Carrying Consort Chen, and I’m sprinting 100 meters already!]
 
- [So even Sister Zhao daydreamed about legendary lives like the rest of us? Feels so relatable!]
 

 
Among all the personas, Han Zhi and Iya had the thickest barrage of comments.
 

 
The former naturally attracted a wave of "girlfriend fans," while the latter was an internationally renowned character. After ‘Iya’s Myth' won an award, Director Shi Qianqiu, seeing the film’s potential, managed to have it released in international holographic cinemas, where it surprisingly achieved impressive box office results. This introduced the goddess's charm to foreign audiences.
 

 
When fans learned that the character Iya was inspired by Tong Zhao's youthful imagination, they admired her even more.
 

 
"She’s too imaginative!"
 

 
Some fans even suggested that since all of her personas were so charming, each could be turned into a movie, which would undoubtedly result in multiple blockbuster hits. This idea became a popular comment, with fans treating it as a fun fantasy—unknowingly hitting close to the truth.
 

 
After all the personas made their entrances, the narrator’s voice, clear and expressive, concluded with a teasing remark:
 

 
[When they all gather together to face Tong Zhao’s official boyfriend, Wei Zekai, what kind of sparks will fly?]
 
[Let’s stay tuned to find out!]
 

 
The final shot froze on Han Zhi’s stunned expression as she turned her head.
 

 
- [Hahahaha, this is too much!]
 
- [The first girlfriend fan to have their idol’s “house collapse”—but instead of a sister-in-law, it’s…]
 
- [How do I even describe this appropriately?]
 
- [Ahhh, I can’t wait to watch the full episode!]
 

 
With the buildup provided by this setting, the audience came to accept the idea that these personas represented different stages of Tong Zhao’s worldview. Some experts speculated that Tong Zhao’s brain might be more developed than average, allowing her to store more detailed memories. However, since Tong Zhao declined to undergo further testing, mainstream opinion settled on the idea that she was simply a unique case, leaving the truth a mystery.
 

 
Because Tong Zhao was so famous, some companies tried to cultivate new talents by encouraging them to develop diverse personas. However, this led to a few awkward and mismatched cases, and the idea was eventually abandoned. They had to accept the reality that her success was one of a kind.

The live broadcast began!
 

 
---
 

 
Wei Zekai slowly opened his eyes.
 

 
He found himself in a semi-lucid state, processing the background information provided by the scenario designer.
 

 
Although he wasn’t given a new identity, he was aware that he was still Wei Zekai, retaining all his real-life memories. The only additional context was a logical acceptance of the following:
 

 
- The eight women he would meet soon were all versions of Tong Zhao.
 
- The castle they were in was a projection of Tong Zhao’s subconscious mind.
 

 
[You are Wei Zekai.]
 
[You wish to propose to your beloved girlfriend. But like every man seeking to win his heart’s desire, you must first earn the approval of certain individuals.]
 
[The difference? These individuals aren’t her elders.]
 
[They are the different versions of Tong Zhao.]
 
[Do you have the confidence to win them over?]
 

 
In the live broadcast, Wei Zekai was seen sitting in a taxi. The driver asked him, “Young man, the place you’re heading to is really remote, huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai instinctively replied, “Yeah, my girlfriend lives in a pretty out-of-the-way spot.”
 

 
As the conversation ended, the taxi turned onto a narrow road. The view opened up to reveal the castle from the promotional video. After paying the fare, Wei Zekai picked up his suitcase and began walking toward it.
 

 
Surrounding the castle was a moat, with tall, spiked fences lining the edge—symbolizing Tong Zhao’s strong defensive nature and her territorial instincts.
 

 
Viewers who enjoy instinct-based reality shows often have a bit of voyeuristic curiosity.
 

 
For Tong Zhao’s fans, this custom-made show offered a chance to glimpse their idol’s truest self, worth pausing frame by frame to analyze and write essays about.
 

 
[So this is Her Majesty the Queen’s inner world?]
 
[If it were me, it’d probably be a tiny house full of silly decorations.]
 
[Hahahaha!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, wasn’t fazed. Standing in front of the grand gates, he shouted, “Baby—I’m here—let me in!”
 

 
As soon as Wei Zekai finished speaking, a giant black rose on the castle’s gate unfurled its petals, revealing a hidden fingerprint scanner. When Wei Zekai placed his hand on it, the system recognized his identity, and the rose gate opened with a creak as the drawbridge lowered.
 

 
The moment Wei Zekai stepped onto the bridge, it seemed to come alive, automatically sliding him forward.
 

 
Then, a magical scene unfolded.
 

 
The once gloomy and ominous castle transformed in an instant as the gates closed behind him. The dark clouds scattered, revealing the castle’s true nature—an idyllic paradise full of spring warmth, chirping birds, and vibrant flowers. It was a dreamlike vacation haven, reflecting Tong Zhao’s inner world when she was with someone she trusted and loved.
 

 
This breathtaking visual immediately captivated the audience.
 

 
[Wow, the director really is Shi Qianqiu—he’s amazing at creating concepts.]
 
[What kind of “spoiling the boyfriend” setup is this? All her favoritism goes to him?]
 
[Oh my god, the bridge moves on its own, taking him straight to her heart. I never expected Zhao Zhao to be this sweet when in love.]
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t great with words of affection.
 

 
When she loved someone, she showed it through her actions—by treating them well and keeping them close.
 

 
Wei Zekai stumbled forward and finally arrived at the castle’s grand entrance, only to face his first challenge.
 

 
Standing before the doors was a tall, imposing man dressed as a butler.
 

 
He bore a striking resemblance to Tong Zhao, sharing about seventy percent of her features, but his sharper facial structure and restrained gentleness set him apart.
 

 
This was Han Zhi, a familiar figure to Tong Zhao’s devoted fans.
 

 
In the next moment, those fans witnessed an unfamiliar side of their idol’s on-screen boyfriend.
 

 
Han Zhi, upon seeing Wei Zekai, furrowed his brows slightly. His handsome face showed clear disdain, as if he were reluctant to let this man pass.
 

 
“You’re supposed to be ‘my’ boyfriend?”
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned. “...Baby, did you ever have a phase where you wanted to be a boy?”
 

 
“First of all, don’t call me ‘baby’. Call me Han Zhi,” he replied coolly.
 

 
“In a period of gender identity confusion and questioning the meaning of existence... yes, Tong Zhao once fantasized about what it would be like if she were a man. And as you can see,” Han Zhi lifted a hand to adjust his tie. The slight movement drew the attention of the female audience to his sharp jawline and the subtle motion of his Adam’s apple. “A more aggressive, dominant male side. Can you accept that?”
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai’s expression looked as if his tail had been stepped on—absolutely flustered.
 

 
This was a sore spot for most men, and he was no exception.
 

 
But...
 

 
“So, are you still Tong Zhao?” he asked.
 

 
Han Zhi nodded indifferently.
 

 
Wei Zekai gritted his teeth. “As long as you’re Tong Zhao, I’ll like you!”
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Han Zhi looked surprised.
 

 
Not because of his heartfelt declaration.
 

 
But because, with a loud ‘poof’, a dog tail popped out from behind Wei Zekai.
# Chapter140: Variety Show Extras (3)
"..."
 

 
The scene froze in awkward silence.
 

 
Wei Zekai, panicking, tried to press down his tail, but to no avail. The once-erect fluffy tail drooped in nervousness. "What the hell? Why do I have a tail… I…"
 

 
"It's probably a construct of the subconscious world. In Tong Zhao's mind, anything is possible," Han Zhi explained, though he offered no consolation.
 

 
Instead, those melancholic, unreadable eyes carried a trace of a faintly mocking smile. "It’s… quite cute."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked like he had just been struck by lightning.
 

 
The AI voice picked up his inner thoughts:
 

 
[So...]
 

 
[In Tong Zhao’s eyes, am I just… a dog?!]
 

 
The barrage of comments on the livestream exploded with laughter, filling the screen with "hahahaha."
 

 
Wei Zekai's dog tail gave a despondent wag before a husky female voice came from behind Han Zhi.
 

 
"Han Zhi, who are you talking to?"
 

 
"A little puppy," Han Zhi replied calmly.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s head and tail both shot up as he looked toward the owner of the voice.
 

 
The newcomer had neatly styled short hair, and her small face, about the size of a palm, was framed by almond-shaped eyes with pale-colored irises. Her features resembled Tong Zhao’s, but the short hair made her features more defined, and she seemed slightly taller than Tong Zhao—perhaps due to some kind of stimulus from the post-apocalyptic world that caused a secondary development. Upon seeing Wei Zekai, she immediately smiled. "Xiao Kai."
 

 
"Uh, hello."
 

 
Wei Zekai greeted her politely, his handsome face showing clear signs of wariness and confusion.
 

 
She looked like his girlfriend.
 

 
But she wasn’t her.
 

 
[Is this another side of Tong Zhao...?] Wei Zekai thought, feeling somewhat lost.
 

 
"I’m Duan Ge," she introduced herself, then nudged Han Zhi to move aside. "Don’t just stand there, come inside, and stop picking on the kid."
 

 
Once Duan Ge spoke, Han Zhi stopped teasing Wei Zekai. He raised an eyebrow, a look that prompted a wave of screenshots from fangirls. "I wasn’t picking on him."
 

 
"True," Duan Ge said, as if recalling something amusing, and gave a small smile. "Wait until he meets the Consort, then he’ll know what real bullying is."
 

 
[Ahhh, I love this subconscious side of hers. So badass!]
 

 
[I think she’s more dominant than Brother Zhi... is that just my impression?]
 

 
[I became a fan of Tong Zhao after watching ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘One Life Survivor’. While her other works are also charming, they never quite gave me that heart-fluttering feeling... But after seeing Duan Ge, I realized—I like this type! I want to stick close to Duan Ge! I want her to step on my face with high heels!]
 

 
The last comment was quickly met with others criticizing the person for being a bit off.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a little uneasy.
 

 
From what she said, was the "Consort" a very frightening character?
 

 
His anxiously swaying tail betrayed his nervousness.
 

 
[But—]
 

 
[If it’s all still Tong Zhao in the end, then there’s nothing to fear.]
 

 
When this thought of Wei Zekai was captured by the AI, a highly upvoted comment popped up:
 

 
[Thank goodness I can’t read, or I might have been blinded by that.]
 

 
---
 

 
Under the guidance of the two, Wei Zekai entered the interior living room of the castle.
 

 
The living room was very spacious and grand, with the wooden floor polished to a shine, and the décor was in a medieval style. This surprised him a bit because Tong Zhao’s real-life home was designed with a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
 

 
He didn’t expect that she actually longed to live in a castle like this.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly made a resolution: when he wakes up from the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, he would definitely gift her a castle even more luxurious and grand than this one! Hmm, he might as well customize one as a wedding house. If Tong Zhao wasn’t planning on getting married soon, the wedding house could be used for the engagement—anyway, he just wanted to give her something special.
 

 
In the middle of the living room were two red carpeted stairways, about two meters wide, leading up to the second floor.
 

 
There were many doors on the second floor.
 

 
"Your task during these eight days is to live with two of Tong Zhao's subconscious personalities for two days each. You need to gain her approval and also experience whether you can accept her with different traits."
 

 
As Han Zhi explained, a special effects text appeared at the bottom of the screen to ensure that any viewers who hadn’t heard clearly understood the concept of the show.
 

 
Wei Zekai was startled. "Does that include you?"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Han Zhi made a face as if his limit had been reached, and coldly responded with a simple "Mm."
 

 
He quickly changed the subject. "Go ahead and pick your first door, don’t waste time."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "How about I pick you directly? Let’s start with the hardest option."
 

 
Han Zhi: "…"
 

 
[Hahaha, Brother Zhi’s life is a complete failure.]
 

 
[Help, Wei Zekai is really so silly.]
 

 
[Reminds me of Aquaman Killer.]
 

 
"Fine.”
 

 
Han Zhi's eyelids lowered for a moment, but in the blink of an eye, the initial look of surprise was completely gone, leaving no trace: "Exactly, it's just right. If you're not used to living with other girls, having me, a guy, to accompany you is perfect, right?"
 

 
"You're absolutely right."
 

 
This really struck a chord with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Although he knew they were all Tong Zhao, it was like with Duan Ge: she had a similar outline, but her aura was vastly different. He couldn’t help but instinctively want to keep a distance from other women who weren’t his girlfriend, let alone "live together." He put his arm around Han Zhi's shoulder and remembered something: "Didn’t we meet in ‘Aquaman Killer’? You even kissed Tong Zhao afterward!"
 

 
This event was particularly vivid for Wei Zekai.
 

 
At the time, he didn’t know what was going on during the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, but after waking up and watching the replay, he discovered that the two had been "secretly communicating" without his knowledge. Back then, he was conflicted, asking himself "I actually kissed a bro, and I kissed him so passionately?"—a moral dilemma that felt like being fried on a hot pan, turning over and over. Since he knew that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, he didn’t think too much about it.
 

 
Now, seeing such a large Han Zhi in front of him, even though he knew he was also a part of Tong Zhao...
 

 
He still felt jealous!
 

 
"Yeah, that's right."
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t deny it.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai completely remembered the plot of ‘Aquaman Killer’. Not only had Han Zhi kissed Tong Zhao, but in that variety show, it seemed that Tong Zhao was merely playing with his feelings. For Han Zhi, it was more like a skilled exchange, a mutual appreciation…
 

 
Thinking of this, Wei Zekai’s tail wagged furiously in anger.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him.
 

 
All of Tong Zhao’s personalities understood her very well, and there was no doubt about why she chose Wei Zekai. In fact, it was probably Tong Zhao herself who was the last to realize that she truly liked him.
 

 
"You don't have to overthink it,"
 
Han Zhi said as he walked up the stairs with him. "Pick a door and open it."
 

 
Wei Zekai was still preoccupied with the fact that he had kissed Tong Zhao and was somewhat distracted. He casually picked a door and turned the doorknob.
 

 
The door was surprisingly ornate.
 

 
A golden, jade-embedded door that looked extraordinary from the outside.
 

 
"You not only kissed her, but it was a French kiss!"
 

 
"Stop nagging,"
 
Han Zhi smirked. "You really know how to pick a door."
 

 
When the door was opened, a faint, enticing fragrance wafted out, and Wei Zekai froze for a moment. What he saw was a beautiful young girl lying on a concubine's couch—this was Tong Zhao from his memory, looking just like she did in high school. Her delicate face and eyes, full of life, were gazing at him.
 

 
The girl furrowed her brows slightly.
 

 
Even though she didn’t speak, Wei Zekai could clearly sense her displeasure from his prolonged and impetuous gaze.
 

 
He quickly looked away.
 

 
"It’s you, this thick-headed fool,"
 
she spoke, her sweet voice mixed with an air of arrogance, unlike Tong Zhao’s usual tone. It was as though she had long been accustomed to being in a superior position in a feudal society, constantly reminding others of the distance between them. But with the casual remark "thick-headed fool," she suddenly became more vivid, no longer just a beautiful object to admire. She grumbled in complaint, "Why is it you? I prefer Jiang Dang, and Shi Qianqiu would be fine too."
 

 
[???????]
 
[Is the DangZhao ship real??? Did it just have a bad ending????]
 
[Oops, I guess I have the same taste as the concubine sister, I also like Jiang Dang!]
 

 
When it came to matters of status, Wei Zekai was unwavering: "The people around Zhao Zhao have always been me."
 

 
"You... never mind,”
 

 
The concubine chuckled softly: "Indeed, it's always been you."
 

 
She waved her hand: "Come in and attend to this palace."
 

 
[Bonus scene with the director being called out: "If it's the Consort, I am truly honored."]
 

 
---
 

 
How to serve the most delicate Consort in the world is a technical skill.
 

 
And Wei Zekai clearly lacked the skills required.
 

 
But he was very earnest.
 

 
When the Consort asked him to fan her, Wei Zekai put in all his effort, fanning each stroke with great determination. The Consort's dark hair fluttered in the wind, her face and hair were tousled by the breeze. Instead of getting angry, she smiled and turned to look at him. He showed no signs of stopping, making her feel as though she was facing a wind fan. She laughed in exasperation: "Are you doing this on purpose or is it accidental?"
 

 
"Don’t worry, I'm well-known in the investment world for being both wise and brave. Not only am I sharp, but I also make time every week for fitness training. Don’t even talk about fanning you—I'd have no problem carrying you around."
 

 
The Consort: "..."
 

 
Being carried in a palanquin was a daily routine for her.
 

 
The Emperor occasionally gave her a princess carry.
 

 
However, being carried like a burlap sack was something else entirely. It was like a young girl getting married, or rather, a ghost marriage. Not only was it her first time, but there was also a fear that it might not bring joy.
 

 
The Consort propped her chin up with one hand and turned her face away from the wind: "Well, you're quite good at taking care of people. I’ve learned something new."
 

 
"I’m not good at taking care of people,"
 

 
Wei Zekai responded honestly, modestly praising himself: "I imagined you as a pregnant Tong Zhao when I was taking care of you. You know, putting myself in your shoes, trying to do my best in every aspect, even fanning you with strength."
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been reading nearby, couldn't hold back and laughed out loud.
 

 
The Consort grabbed another feather fan and tossed it at his head, laughing and scolding, "Making a fool of me, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi reacted quickly and easily caught the fan. He walked over to Wei Zekai, signaling him to step aside, and then changed the fanning method to a softer, gentler motion: "You said you were taking care of a pregnant Tong Zhao... well, you really need to learn. The wind from just now won’t do."
 

 
Wei Zekai watched him for a moment.
 

 
The fan was light, and the breeze it created was gentle.
 

 
Wei Zekai tentatively asked:
 

 
"Brother Zhi, did you forget to eat?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
His brother Zhi really wanted to smack the rice bowl onto his forehead.
# Chapter141: Variety Show Special (4) – “If You Dare Say ‘Drink More Hot Water,’ You’re Done For…”
In just half a day, Wei Zekai fully understood the deeper meaning behind Brother Zhi’s comment, “You really know how to pick a door to open.”
 

 
The imperial concubine was truly a master at delegating tasks.
 

 
Running up and down, serving tea and pouring water, was just the basics.
 

 
When it came to giving massages, he almost sent Her Majesty into a state of bliss right then and there.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s utter lack of caregiving skills surprised everyone. Some viewers in the bullet comments speculated it was because he was a super-rich second-generation heir, raised in a life of luxury where everything was handed to him on a silver platter. Having even the awareness to take care of someone was already a feat for him.
 

 
But then the question arose: if Tong Zhao were ever really pregnant, could he handle it?
 

 
[If he casually spends just a little, he could hire 100 nannies, each assigned to care for one of Tong Zhao's fingers.]
 

 
[...The previous comment is so accurate. I'm envious.]
 

 
[So having money really makes it easier to be a "good man." Laughing but also agreeing.]
 

 
When Han Zhi asked the same question, the concubine herself wasn’t worried. She shared the same view as the bullet comments—he’s rich enough to hire people to take care of everything. Her husband only needs to manage the kingdom, keep her entertained when present, and swipe his card for endless shopping sprees.
 

 
After all, back in the palace, there was no reason for the emperor to personally care for pregnant women.
 

 
Specialized skills belong to professionals; leave it to the experts.
 

 
Even the ever-critical and picky concubine didn’t think this approach meant slacking off.
 

 
The audience was in stitches, joking that it was fortunate this was just one of Tong Zhao's passing thoughts. Otherwise, how could she have produced so many great works? She would’ve retired from the industry long ago and gotten married.
 

 
But that’s not entirely true.
 

 
The concubine has an exceptional eye for men, and even someone as wealthy as Wei Zekai isn’t her idea of “the best.” Without power in his hands, he still falls short. She’d rather stick to acting, though her roles might be limited to playing heartthrobs and femme fatales. Even so, in an era dominated by pure cinema, she’d still shine brightly, become the queen of genre films, and captivate countless elites vying for her attention.
 

 
Han Zhi was convinced by her reasoning.
 

 
“I hadn’t thought of it that way,” Wei Zekai admitted, looking confused. “If Tong Zhao had plans for children, of course I’d hire help. But I’d also arrange my work in advance… I’ve heard pregnancy is like being ill. When your girlfriend’s sick, how can you not stay by her side?”
 

 
“So you’d take care of her personally?”
 

 
“Of course. I’ll handle all three meals and midnight snacks too—no problem.”
 

 
Wei Zekai patted his chest in assurance.
 

 
Some viewers found this incredibly sweet.
 

 
In reality shows like Instinct, people often reveal their true selves. Some even become more straightforward than usual.
 

 
Wei Zekai was speaking sincerely.
 

 
However, viewers who had watched ‘Sea King’ joked in the bullet comments not to have unrealistic expectations about Wei "Dog" taking over all three meals. Given his cooking skills, they’d already be grateful if he didn’t blow up the kitchen or give the pregnant woman food poisoning. It’s better for him to focus on earning money to support the family—being a househusband just isn’t for him.
 

 
After some playful back-and-forth in the comments, the consensus was:
 

 
[A+ for effort. On behalf of Sister Zhao and the baby, we appreciate the thought.]
 

 
---
 

 
In the afternoon, the concubine grew tired and sent the two men away, saying she’d rest for a while and call them if needed.
 

 
A young woman in full traditional attire casually saying she’d "call someone"…
 

 
The scene felt so jarringly modern it resembled a time-travel drama.
 

 
Viewers were reluctant to part ways; they wanted to see more of Tong Zhao in her ancient costume. There was a special kind of delight in being bossed around by a beauty like her. Plus, the concubine “rewarded” her servants as she worked them—without showing even an inch of skin, her fleeting glances, teasing smiles, and feigned annoyance were visual treats, a feast for the eyes like having ice cream.
 

 
In one scene, Wei Zekai fanned her too vigorously, directing the breeze straight into the concubine’s face and making the corners of her eyes turn red.
 

 
The bullet comments were stunned:
 

 
[Wait—is this really free to watch?]
 
[I take back everything I said about Wei the rich kid. Please fan harder, thanks.]
 

 
Wei Zekai hadn’t meant to cause trouble, and he wasn’t dumb. After being scolded by the concubine twice, he quickly learned the correct way to serve his girlfriend. Female viewers sighed enviously over his evolution into the ultimate attentive boyfriend. But to Concubine Chen, he was nothing more than:
 

 
“Barely passable.”
 

 
It really isn’t easy to please Sister Concubine!
 

 
So, what could Wei Zekai and Han Zhi possibly do when left alone together?
 

 
At this moment, the show cut to an interview segment from Shi Qianqiu’s omniscient perspective:
 

 
"If you were to spend time alone with Tong Zhao’s boyfriend, what would you want to do?"
 

 
Even without seeing his face, viewers instantly recognized the sly and unmistakably sarcastic voice of Shi Qianqiu. The bullet comments lit up with jokes:
 

 
[Fake dog: Wei “Dog.” Real dog: Shi Qianqiu.]
 

 
In the interview, Han Zhi’s expression turned momentarily blank with confusion before he replied:
 

 
"There’s nothing I’d want to do... Just hope he cherishes Tong Zhao. She’s been through a lot."
 

 
After finishing his sentence, Han Zhi paused, his gaze lowering slightly:
 

 
"It’s never been easy."
 

 
---
 

 
Having no particular plans, Han Zhi took Wei Zekai to his room.
 

 
This room was starkly different from the one he used during live streams with his female fans. It was truly his personal space, one that mirrored his room within Tong Zhao's "Palace of Consciousness." The room was minimalist to the extreme, almost devoid of a lived-in feel. No decorations, no unnecessary furniture, and not even a trace of clutter on the desk. The room was dominated by a black-and-white color scheme, its only exception being a half-burned scented candle on the nightstand, the sole hint that someone actually lived there.
 

 
Han Zhi sat down on the bed.
 

 
Noticing there weren’t any chairs, Wei Zekai didn’t feel like standing to chat, so after a brief moment of consideration, he casually sat down on the floor.
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips curved slightly, almost imperceptibly.
 

 
AI captured his inner thoughts: "I was actually thinking of inviting him to sit next to me... Oh well, never mind."
 

 
Han Zhi had a face that exuded deep emotion. But when listening to his inner monologue, one could occasionally sense traces of aloof detachment.
 

 
Wei Zekai attempted to start a conversation. "Your room... It’s decorated in quite a unique way, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, his lashes casting shadows that added a hint of melancholy to his expression. "There was a time when I experienced gender dysphoria."
 

 
There was a fleeting moment of silence, heavy with unspoken context.
 

 
In the past, BL novels featuring gender-swapped protagonists were popular, where the lead characters cheerfully adapted to their new male forms to engage in romantic adventures. But for Tong Zhao's soul, trapped in a male body, things weren’t so simple or joyous. Han Zhi endured a long period of self-doubt, eventually channeling the admiration from his fans as his sole source of validation.
 

 
To Han Zhi, gender became irrelevant. It didn’t matter who he was, or who others saw him as. His entourage of bodyguards and adoring fans served as his protective shield.
 

 
He was a perfect celebrity, so flawless he seemed almost unreal.
 

 
Learning to let go and enjoy life came much later.
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was calm but tinged with residual vulnerability. "Having extra furniture makes it harder for me to sleep."
 

 
"When did this happen?"
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, his tone filled with urgency.
 

 
Tong Zhao had never mentioned it to him.
 

 
Han Zhi immediately pinpointed the source of his worry and chuckled. "She doesn’t like complaining to others."
 

 
She excelled at comforting others, but when she was in pain, she preferred to grit her teeth and endure it silently.
 

 
Han Zhi paused briefly, suppressing a wave of discomfort. As someone who shared the same soul as Tong Zhao, he too disliked airing grievances unless it was to gain sympathy or to emotionally connect with fans. When he did show his vulnerability, it was often a calculated move.
 

 
He said softly, "You’re in a relationship with her, so take the initiative to care for her. If she says nothing’s wrong, just give her a hug."
 

 
"The Noble Concubine's evaluation of you is that you're a late-stage, hopeless straight-laced guy. Your saving grace? You're obedient and easy to command," Han Zhi quipped with a knowing smile.
 

 
"I can teach you how to make her happy."
 

 
Faced with this self-proclaimed relationship expert, Wei Zekai looked stunned.
 

 
Male viewers commented in the livestream:
 

 
[Master, teach me too! Is this valuable knowledge available for free?]
 

 
Female viewers, however, were far more straightforward:
 

 
[I want Han Zhi to make me happy too! Hug Han Zhi!]
 
[It works the other way too. I want to make Han Zhi happy!]
 

 
Some even coined a mock title:
 

 
"Han Zhi’s Guide to Pleasing Your Girlfriend 101."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised his hand nervously. "What should I do when my girlfriend’s on her period?"
 

 
Han Zhi smiled faintly, his expression serene and elegant. "Why don’t you tell me what you’d do first?"
 

 
However, the content scanned by the AI was: "Anyone who says 'drink more hot water' should be buried."
 

 
[Hahaha, "drink more hot water" is so real!]
 
[I think he just read Wei Zekai's mind.]
 

 
Some viewers were confused: [Isn't it bad to be cold during your period? What's wrong with drinking hot water?]
 

 
"Drink... drink... brown sugar water?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Han Zhi: [It's hard now.]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Han Zhi, what are you doing?]
 

 
[Is this really allowed to air???]
 

 
Han Zhi: [My fist is hard now.]
 

 
[......]
 

 
[Alright, Han Zhi, you're amazing.]
 

 
[You AI machines, don't breathe so loudly, damn it!]
 

 
Han Zhi went on, saying everything that needed to be said, then added: "Some influencer accounts show videos of good men saying sweet words, but the truth is every woman is different. If she doesn’t say she wants to hear a story, it’s better to say less. If she’s in pain and sweating, wipe it off for her. If she’s cold and uncomfortable, give her a hug, let her know you're there and that you're patient. Don’t ask if she’s feeling better, she can't control when she'll feel better... Anyway, let me demonstrate."
 

 
On the bed, he pulled the stunned Wei Zekai (pretending to be the "period version of a dog") into his arms, patted his head, and lowered his voice slightly: "Anyway, I won’t leave even when you get better. Rest well, I’m staying with you."
 

 
[How much would this "immersive Wei Zekai experience" cost to buy?!]
 

 
[I’m so jealous of this guy who not only got my sister but is also being hugged by my brother!!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was envied and resented by fans, eagerly asked, “Should I memorize this sentence?”
 

 
“No need, when you’re in a relationship, don’t overthink it. Don’t memorize lines.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, “Here, I’ll give you a chance for a practical lesson. If I’m uncomfortable during my period, what would you do?”
 

 
From the god’s perspective, Shi Qianqiu understood everything and immediately switched to Wei Zekai’s view, letting the audience clearly see Han Zhi clutching his abdomen, his brow furrowed in agony. The handsome guy’s suffering, combined with an oddly alluring expression, was fully displayed for the audience to see—
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath.
 

 
[Don’t memorize lines…] he reminded himself.
 

 
“I’m here.”
 

 
He said, taking Han Zhi’s hand and reassuringly squeezing it. “I feel for you, let me hug you.”
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
[…Damn! ]
 

 
All the viewers could hear his exasperated, curse-laced thought.
 

 
Han Zhi’s initial discomfort had been fake.
 

 
Now, it was real.
 

 
Wei Zekai, completely unaware that he had triggered Han Zhi’s sensitive spot, was still reviewing and learning: “Tong Zhao never tells me when she’s on her period, so I don’t have any practical experience. You can act it out with me a few more times.”
 

 
Han Zhi quickly retreated three arms' length away and raised his hand to signal him to stop.
 

 
He said, "I just remembered something."
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly asked, "What is it?"
 

 
Han Zhi: "...She doesn't have menstrual cramps.”
# Chapter142: Variety Show Extra (5) The One You Love Doesn’t Need to Be Tested...
It was time for the bi-daily summary interview.
 

 
In the live broadcast, the audience saw Wei Zekai, who had been tormented by the Concubine for two days, walking into the confessional room with a tired expression. Inside the room, there was no priest, only a floating light orb.
 

 
"Hello..."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at the light orb with some doubt.
 

 
"Hello."
 

 
The synthesized male voice, altered through sound modulation, sounded a little ethereal.
 

 
Narrator: At this moment, our protagonist, Wei Zekai, still doesn’t know the true identity of the host behind the scenes!
 

 
"After these two days of... torment, ah no, I mean, getting to know each other, what are your feelings?" the host asked.
 

 
"You just said torment, right? I definitely heard you say torment!"
 

 
"Please share your thoughts."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Aren’t you going to explain what you mean by 'torment'?"
 

 
The man and the orb stared at each other for a moment.
 

 
The host orb sighed slowly, then seriously explained, "Of course not! Our show's goal is to help you understand your girlfriend in a warm and loving way.”
 

 
Wei Zekai sat down on the chair, still finding it hard to let go of his wariness toward the light orb.
 

 
But since it was a requirement of the show, he could only be honest.
 

 
"So, it turns out Tong Zhao has such a demanding side. How should I put it? You might think it’s torment, but as long as I think of her as Tong Zhao, seeing that face that’s exactly like hers..." Once he started talking, Wei Zekai was actually quite honest and easy to coax. His cheeks flushed slightly, and he seemed a bit shy. "I actually enjoy being bossed around by her. She doesn’t usually ask for help, and she doesn’t rely on me, so when she does ask me to do something, it feels good."
 

 
Hearing this, the light orb seemed to shrink for a moment.
 

 
For some reason, Wei Zekai had the feeling that this inorganic being was holding back laughter.
 

 
The comments were laughing the hardest:
 

 
[It’s just the Concubine's task.]
 

 
"So, do you think this experience has been helpful to you?" the host orb continued.
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded. "From now on, I’ll know how to take care of her even before she opens her mouth."
 

 
A round of synthesized cheers and applause followed.
 

 
The host orb said, "Congratulations, you’ve become an excellent tool person!"
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail swished irritably a few times, and he muttered under his breath, "I don’t know why, but whenever I hear you speak, I feel this annoying familiarity, you remind me of someone I really don’t like..."
 

 
"That really hurts my feelings. This is our first meeting," the host orb sighed dramatically.
 

 
"Is that so? Sorry, I must have been overthinking."
 

 
"No need to mind, I'm not the petty type."
 

 
The host orb watched as Wei Zekai left.
 

 
The comments were full of reactions, with viewers exclaiming that Wei Zekai wasn't the dog at all.
 

 
The real dog was clearly the director.
 

 
From the viewers' god’s-eye view, it was clear that the one controlling the light orb and talking to Wei Zekai was Shi Qianqiu, who was sitting in the director’s chair backstage. Today, he wasn’t dressed in his usual tropical wind look, but instead wore a casual bunny-themed coral fleece pajama with bunny ears on his hat.
 

 
As Wei Zekai left the confession room, Shi Qianqiu winked at the camera, causing a surge of excitement among viewers, especially those with a fondness for good looks.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu sighed with enthusiasm: "I can't wait for the show to air!"
 

 
[Stop acting cute, Old Thief Shi.]
 

 
[Help, is this the legendary 'disgustingly handsome'?]
 

 
[My heart aches for the Dog for a second.]
 

 
＊
 

 
The second pair was Lu Xianchang and Zhao Zai.
 

 
Although it was unexpected, the personality that got along best with Zhao Zai was indeed Lu Xianchang. Every time Zhao Zai was bullied by the Concubine, she would cry and rush into Lu Xianchang's arms.
 

 
Perhaps because Lu Xianchang knew Wei Zekai had been tormented by the Concubine earlier, her attitude toward him, as someone who strongly resisted men, had softened.
 

 
His job was to play with Zhao Zai.
 

 
In the colorful children's room filled with toys, Lu Xianchang spent time playing various little games with Zhao Zai, which for the wealthy Wei Zekai...
 

 
...was simply heaven!
 

 
The younger version of Tong Zhao was just too adorable.
 

 
After Wei Zekai helped Zhao Zai build a small castle with blocks, he stared at her round little face and couldn't help but sigh, "You know, if I had met you when I was in elementary school, how great would that have been?"
 

 
Zhao Zai, feeling his gaze, defensively clenched the blocks in her hand.
 

 
Wei Zekai gently patted her head, "I wish I had met you earlier."
 

 
At every stage of life, he wanted to go through it with her.
 

 
Zhao Zai nuzzled his palm, and with her bright, clear eyes, she looked intently at this older brother, making Wei Zekai’s heart melt.
 

 
Lu Xianchang asked him why he was staring at the child.
 

 
Without hesitation, Wei Zekai replied, "I want our future kids to look just like their mom."
 

 
Lu Xianchang: "..."
 

 
Crazy.
 

 
The audience saw the elegant, goddess-like figure of Lu Xianchang give an expression of disdain, maximizing the show’s effect.
 

 
The host orb, acting as the representative of the viewers, asked Lu Xianchang, who had always acted so dismissive of men, what she thought of Wei Zekai. She replied:
 

 
"My opinion? What opinion could I have?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang gave the orb a faint glance, as if already seeing through the true identity behind the light ball. Her almond-shaped eyes glinted with coldness. Though her eyes were the same shape as Tong Zhao's, they looked even more distant, pushing people away with an air of aloofness.
 

 
It was as though she was friendly to women, but only in comparison to men. Overall, regardless of gender, she kept a distance from people. "By becoming my independent subconscious, I am preserving Tong Zhao's right to love others. Whoever she loves is good."
 

 
In this fantastical world, after the trauma she witnessed and the profound shock it brought, she found it difficult to get close to anyone.
 

 
The system separated her into a different persona, allowing Tong Zhao to later become a more "normal" person.
 

 
The host orb mischievously stirred the pot: "What if he's not good to her?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang placed her slender, pale hand on her sword—
 

 
"Execute him."
 

 
Narration special effects text: [I really want to see the male lead's head roll.]
 

 
As soon as this line of effects appeared, another popped up: [Director, this is broadcast content, you can't send bullet comments!]
 

 
[—Please forget the previous two lines!]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Shi Qianqiu, stop sending bullet comments!]
 

 
[Stop bullying Wei Zekai!]
 

 
[Well done! I mean, increase the intensity.]
 

 
In this variety show, Wei Zekai might as well be the one with his head rolling.
 

 
He said he wanted to understand Duan Ge, so Duan Ge sat for a while, smoked two cigarettes, and in the end, it was Wei Zekai who quietly said that smoking was bad for the health, which made Duan Ge put out the cigarette. The host orb floated into the living room and suggested, "Maybe a fight would help you understand each other."
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t respond, and Wei Zekai thought that was fine.
 

 
The bullet comments were in a panic:
 

 
[Wei Zekai, ahead is hell!]
 

 
[Help, this episode should be renamed ‘Shi Qianqiu’s Daily Dog Torture’!]
 

 
[Torturing dogs is illegal, Director Shi! Actually, you just want to see him get beaten, right?]
 

 
As the audience expected, Wei Zekai was completely outmatched—he was in full protective gear for the ring fight, and although it didn’t look violent, he wasn’t seriously hurt. He only had minor bruises where he had been hit. Duan Ge thought the kid was kind of cute, so he went easy on him, letting him land a few punches. After feeling the punches, Duan Ge was a bit impressed with how seriously he fought.
 

 
When Duan Ge and Shuyi were together, it seemed like Wei Zekai was living in two extremes.
 

 
Shuyi took Wei Zekai, who had been knocked out, to rest for a while, then brought him to the library in the castle.
 

 
This library didn’t have actual books but was a collection of Tong Zhao’s memory fragments.
 

 
“These are memories from a long time ago,”
 

 
Shuyi picked up a dusty book and opened it, revealing a photo inside.
 

 
The audience saw it was a younger version of Wei Zekai, hurriedly walking toward "himself."
 

 
“Fortunately, it was me who caught the basketball. He apologized to me, promising not to make the same mistake again.”
 

 
“He’s good-looking, but he’s a bit foolish.”
 

 
The second photo showed Wei Zekai, after noticing she was unwell, handing her a Coke and painkillers.
 

 
“I got my period, and he bought me a Coke, calling it ‘fatty’s happy drink...’” Shuyi placed her hand on the book, feeling Tong Zhao’s emotions from that time, imitating her helpless tone.
 

 
“Forget it.”
 

 
“Why do people think he’s scary? He’s really so silly.”
 

 
There were many more, all of them memories of the two of them.
 

 
“I didn’t want to test you—Tong Zhao likes you. What I want to do is just teach you how to understand her,” Shuyi said gently. She resembled Tong Zhao in both her eyes and brows, carrying a warm, compassionate air. “She’s as complicated as this castle, but she doesn’t want to be like this. Can you give her a little patience?”
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded.
 

 
He said, "I feel like I could stay here for the rest of my life."
 

 
＊
 

 
"I really don't understand why you want to stay with me."
 

 
Iya, who had been assigned to live with Tong Zhao, had a cold, ethereal expression on her face.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled gently, wrapping her arms around her and hanging on her like a koala: "God loves everyone, Sister Iya."
 

 
The saintess furrowed her brows, clearly annoyed.
 

 
She knew what the next arrangements would be, so she said, "I have no interest in your little lover. You don't need to show him to me. Who you choose to be with is none of my business."
 

 
Sister Saintess was so hard to please.
 

 
However, when Wei Zekai entered the room, it was just after he had been beaten up by Duan Ge again, a large bruise on his left temple making him look pitiful. After greeting the two of them, Iya waved her hand impatiently: "Come here."
 

 
Wei Zekai, confused, but having learned a lesson over the past few days, knew one important thing.
 

 
That was, whatever his girlfriend said was absolute.
 

 
He had to listen.
 

 
He walked over, but was stopped just one step away. He heard the blindfolded girl say in a disgusted tone, "Don't get too close to me."
 

 
She called him over, but also didn’t want him too close.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail drooped pitifully.
 

 
However, the next moment, that cool little hand rested on his head and patted it.
 

 
A cool sensation settled on his forehead, and the pain from his injury vanished in an instant.
 

 
When Wei Zekai, surprised, raised his head again, the girl in front of him was gone. Only the Tong Zhao he knew best remained. She pinched his cheek, pretending to be jealous, and said with a smile, "How unfair, she doesn’t treat me well, but why can’t she stand seeing you hurt?"
 

 
"I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to!" Thinking his girlfriend was upset, Wei Zekai wagged his tail furiously, "I didn’t do anything!"
 

 
At that moment, a voice from the director explained:
 

 
[All of Tong Zhao’s subconscious likes and dislikes will shift according to her will.]
 

 
[So, what you're saying is, Xiao Zhao is being tsundere.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Director Shi even ruins Sister Zhao’s stage while being a tease!]
 

 
[Director Shi has gone mad.]
 

 
Just like Shuyi and Lu Xianchang said, there is no such thing as a test.
 

 
The person you love doesn't need to be tested, and neither does the relationship.
 

 
What matters is not wanting them to suffer or feel pain, but the steady, continuous care and love.
 

 
She ran away too quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood her, after all, someone who is used to the cultivation lifestyle does not enjoy dealing with trivial matters.
 

 
She moved her shoulders a bit and rubbed her buzzing temples.
 

 
Just then, a staff member came over to bring her a hot towel to wipe her face. After wiping her face, she felt much more refreshed.
 

 
Staff Member: "Sister Zhao, you can go rest now."
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" was filmed continuously without any breaks, which placed an even greater mental burden on the actors.
 

 
While the other actors who woke up afterward were still in the chamber and had yet to come to their senses, she was already able to get up and leave. Seeing this, the staff members, who had a deep understanding of the instinctive nature of filming, couldn't help but marvel at how her mind worked—it was truly impressive.
 

 
Tong Zhao stepped out into the corridor; the actor dormitory was one floor up.
 

 
Important roles did not need to share rooms with others and were provided with the best suites.
 

 
As Tong Zhao turned towards the elevator, the door of the holographic filming room, which had a temporary actor nameplate hanging on it, opened from the inside. A beautiful woman in her late twenties with an oval face walked out, locking eyes with her and showing surprise: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan! Can I have your autograph?”
 

 
“I didn’t bring a pen, but can we take a photo together?”
 

 
The beautiful woman nodded enthusiastically, her eyes sparkling with excitement—she was a true fan.
 

 
This temporary actress, named Fu Xiaoheng, felt utterly satisfied after getting a photo with Tong Zhao. When she woke up, she discovered that she was the only one left in the entire extra actors’ room. She also received a text from the staff saying that she performed particularly well and, due to last-minute changes in the plot, her pay would be increased accordingly. She might even have her name listed in the supporting cast section.
 

 
Although she still didn’t know what exactly her role in the plot was, Fu Xiaoheng’s face was filled with joy: “Maybe I had a lot of scenes with you, Sister Zhao! Ah, I won’t take a break; I want to watch the footage right away—wait, but I’m just an extra, so I don’t have the right to watch the footage…”
 

 
Upon saying this, she felt a bit down.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, “If your name is on the supporting cast list, that shouldn’t count as just being an extra, right?”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng explained that they had to wait for the approval process in the backend, and the footage wouldn’t be sent to her dorm room.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out her phone and asked Shi Qianqiu for his opinion. After receiving a response, she said, “Director Shi said I can go to my room to watch it, as long as I don’t take the footage out.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: !!!
 

 
“Really? Won't it cause you any trouble?” She hesitated a bit.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had agreed quite casually, so it probably wasn’t a serious issue.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was so excited that she wanted to hug her, but since they weren’t very familiar, she didn’t dare to do that. Instead, she followed closely beside her, her heart racing with thoughts of writing a lengthy post for social media—What a day! Not only was she promoted from an extra to a named supporting character, but she was also going to watch the footage with the goddess Zhao. Oh my gosh, she wanted to post about it right away!
 

 
Concubine Chen, covering her face with a feather fan, thought: [Can you stop bringing women into your room all the time? It’d be nice to bring a man back for once.]
 

 
Tong Zhao explained, “When I saw her, I felt a sense of familiarity; we probably had scenes together in the film.”
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed correctly.
 

 
The footage sent from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was from the female lead's perspective, and it hadn’t been edited yet, so she didn’t know what the final result would look like. In her mind, everyone gathered on small stools to watch together.
 

 
Although it was the same face, the aura was vastly different.
 

 
So, in the palace of memories, a banner was unfurled, discussing the topic of “who is more handsome, Brother Duan or Master Lu.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Each has their strengths; the grand scenes in xianxia films are more impressive.”
 

 
Female Reporter: “I still prefer the scene where Brother Duan clips the bullets; it’s very tough-guy.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I particularly like the scene where he leaps into the sword furnace; I vote for Master Lu.”
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled, “Master Lu really wields a great sword!”
 

 
Female Reporter: “Pun jokes will cost you.”
 

 
---
 

 
On the other side, Chen Zhuzhi, who had woken up from the capsule much earlier, had already regained most of his memory.
 

 
Although he had been downgraded to a supporting role, the staff didn’t ask him to move out of the suite; he could still stay until the contract with the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew expired. He paced back and forth in his room, feeling anxious, while his manager took two hours to return his call. “Brother Chen, please stop calling me non-stop. I have other artists to manage. When things get busy, I can’t keep up with you. Didn’t you just wake up from the capsule not long ago? You should really be resting now.”
 

 
“Don’t brush me off!”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was annoyed. “Why was my name removed from the lead role section? Listen, the final cut hasn’t come out yet, so there’s still room for negotiation. You need to find a way to pull some strings…”
 

 
After being berated, the manager, feeling a bit displeased, retorted sarcastically, “If you can’t handle your own subconscious, how am I supposed to help you with connections? Why don’t you just ask Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s expression darkened further.
 

 
What he wanted was for his manager to ask Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Last time, because he didn’t want to share money with his ex-girlfriend, Shi Qianqiu had warned him that if he bothered him again, he would find someone to break his legs—he could shamelessly seek help from others, but he truly didn’t dare provoke Shi Qianqiu. This opportunistic manager wasn’t willing to waste any more time on him: “Since you’ve gone from rising to sinking, you might as well settle into being a supporting villain. By the way, if you’re going to be a supporting role in the future, you won’t need your current team; the company will cut down the budget for you, and I’ll assign your assistant to someone else. Just take a break and see if any opportunities come up later.”
 

 
Supporting role!
 

 
After the manager hung up on Chen Zhuzhi, he felt helpless and thought of contacting his ex-girlfriend through Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He called her, appealing to her interests, explaining that he signed a contract, and if he dropped from a lead to a supporting role, his pay would be significantly reduced, which would also lower the compensation he needed to give her.
 

 
His ex-girlfriend laughed, “Director Shi told me that the part you owe me will be directly transferred to my account, no matter how you perform, it won’t affect my share. Did you change your phone number again? I didn’t block this one… Oh well, it doesn’t matter if I block it now. So, you’ve been downgraded from lead to supporting role? That means you didn’t compete with Tong Zhao. Good to know; I’ll buy a ticket to see ‘Heartless Tribulation’ when it comes out. Goodbye!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was certainly not doing charity.
 

 
To have someone with a wicked temperament perform in an instinctive film, he naturally had to bear the relevant risks. He had rich experience dealing with such matters and would never let unrelated issues affect others.
 

 
After all, he needed the subconscious of a villain; he didn’t really like mingling with them.
 

 
This was the second time today that Chen Zhuzhi had his call dropped.
 

 
He slumped on the sofa.
 

 
As long as it wasn’t a serious criminal case involving murder, arson, or strong-arming, instinctive films needed many roles that required a despicable subconscious. However, most of these were supporting roles, and only a very few had the opportunity to be leads. This was because mainstream audiences preferred to see positive, kind-hearted characters.
 

 
Opportunities for villainous leads were fiercely contested.
 

 
The news that he had lost the dual-lead role to Tong Zhao would spread quickly in the industry, effectively closing the door to any future leading roles for him. His subconscious wasn’t remarkable enough; even his villainy was bland and unremarkable. Evil could be charming, but his was not distinct or vivid enough to impress Shi Qianqiu with a compelling narrative. His evil was merely off-putting…
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi covered his face with his hands.
 

 
In his mind, he could hear his manager's scornful mockery, along with his ex-girlfriend's gleeful laughter.
 

 
Then he raised his head, reluctantly and anxiously surveying the exquisite suite.
 

 
The next time he came to the film studio, he would have to share a room with other supporting actors.
 

 
The program team of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had moved Chen Zhuzhi from the lead role section to the supporting role section during the shooting, and keen-eyed fans noticed this and screenshot it, posting it on film forums, sparking a lively discussion.
 

 
Some netizens believed that the dual-lead competitive PK was merely a gimmick—
 

 
[It just increases the workload for post-editing, and is bound to waste one of the actor's performances. Poor Chen Zhuzhi.]
 

 
[What a pity, what’s so tragic about a domestic abuser?]
 

 
[The notorious artist has roles to play thanks to the popularity of instinctive films. Shi Qianqiu’s hiring choices are really cold and merciless. Personally, I’m happy to see Tong Zhao kick him off the lead role; I heard he signed a contract with a betting clause? Dropping to the supporting role means he won’t get any profit shares? Great, I’ll buy a ticket to support!]
 

 
[Rest assured to buy a ticket in support! 1]
 

 
[Am I the only one eagerly looking forward to Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the Fairy Yingchen? And who is this new supporting character, Fu Xiaoheng? Could someone knowledgeable please introduce her?]
 

 
Aside from Tong Zhao, the biggest beneficiary from ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was Fu Xiaoheng.
 

 
The crew took new promotional photos of her, placing her fourth in the lineup, right after Ding Jiao.
 

 
Not only did the company improve her treatment, but she also received additional offers for supporting roles.
 

 
Being able to excel as a temporary actor and rise to a supporting role proved that her subconscious was quite expressive.
 

 
The dual-lead competitive filming style of ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was very novel, even among instinctive films, and it inherently had a gimmick. With the outcome of this PK, it was delightfully satisfying to see good triumph over evil, which further boosted audience expectations.
 

 
On the pre-sale ranking for viewing rights on online platforms, ‘Heartless Tribulation’ shot straight to first place.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also humorously dubbed the most profitable subconscious.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had stopped speaking in the group chat for the crew, and no one tagged him.
 

 
Ding Jiao privately told Tong Zhao that she suspected Chen Zhuzhi had muted the group.
 

 
And it was probably for the best.
 

 
After all, after the shooting, the ‘Heartless Tribulation’ crew group chat had instantly turned into Tong Zhao's fan club branch.
 

 
But why was that?
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: “There aren’t many subconscious minds that can handle Brother Shi’s scripts. For this point regarding Sister Zhao, I’m a fan!”
 

 
Modeling Team Guy: “Has Sister Zhao considered becoming a special forces soldier?”
 

 
Props Master: “Tong Zhao, I’m your fan!”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “What a coincidence, so am I.”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Me too, me too!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was later brought into the group; she didn’t speak much but would always chime in to support Tong Zhao whenever there was a chance to praise her. Originally, Ding Jiao was supposed to have a significant role, but because of Chen Zhuzhi, she ended up becoming a complete supporting character. Fortunately, after Shao Xuanzheng was killed, Li Qiaoqiao stepped up to support Mu Yingchen, which helped her regain some presence.
 

 
Ding Jiao didn’t hold it against Tong Zhao and took this opportunity to build a good relationship with her, hoping for future collaboration opportunities.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse her goodwill.
 

 
In the subsequent promotional efforts for the crew, the friendly interactions among the three female characters further relegated Chen Zhuzhi to the role of a background figure.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was furious about this.
 

 
He didn’t dare to cause trouble, nor did he have the ability to mess with Tong Zhao. What good would it do to make her miserable? If this had happened before filming started, he might have had the chance to scheme against her, but as adults focused on their interests, Chen Zhuzhi wouldn’t act impulsively out of momentary anger.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi shifted his thinking.
 

 
He wanted to create a CP with Tong Zhao to ride her popularity, hoping to turn his luck around.
 

 
In a talk show promoting ‘Heartless Tribulation’, he frequently brought up Tong Zhao, shamelessly trying to win her over—
 

 
—“Ever since I saw Sister Zhao’s debut in ‘The Legend of Emperor Ming’, she has been my favorite actress. I was so happy to know I could work with her that I couldn’t sleep well for three days. I even worried I might actually fall asleep when lying in the holographic chamber.”
 

 
—“My ideal type is Tong Zhao.”
 

 
—“Honestly, it’s normal that I didn’t perform well in the role of Shao Xuanzheng… If it weren’t for the plot, there’s no way I’d break up with such a beautiful wife like Mu Yingchen. I’d hold onto Fairy Yingchen’s thigh and never let go!”
 

 
He looked quite presentable, which was very deceptive.
 

 
Unfortunately, Tong Zhao wasn’t falling for it.
 

 
—“I don’t use Weibo much and rarely watch entertainment news. The first time I heard about you, it was on the front page of a social news article.”
 

 
She directly poked at his history with his abusive ex-girlfriend.
 

 
—“Really? I’m considering a transformation starting today.”
 

 
When he said the last line, the program’s cameras immediately zoomed in on Tong Zhao, who wore a slightly aloof but strikingly beautiful face, clearly showing her disdain. This delighted the director of the talk show, who saw a perfect explosive moment right in front of him—who wouldn’t be happy?
 

 
In the entertainment industry, where everything is usually glossed over, it’s rare for faces to be openly torn apart.
 

 
There were instances in the past, but they have become quite scarce recently.
 

 
Disagreements usually exist between fan groups, while stars greet each other with smiles, leaving no room for leaks.
 

 
There’s only a fine line between being genuine and lacking emotional intelligence.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao showed no intention of picking up the conversation, Chen Zhuzhi felt anxious but also thought that one shouldn’t hit those who smile. He hadn’t offended Tong Zhao, and there was no need for her to deal with him, so he wanted to be extra attentive to her in any encounters they might have—
 

 
However, there were no opportunities at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s agent was much more capable than his.
 

 
What about bribing paparazzi to capture suggestive angles?
 

 
Sister Chu instructed Tong Zhao’s two female assistants to guard her closely, not giving him any chance to approach.
 

 
Afterward, for that episode of the talk show, Sister Chu used her connections and influence to eliminate any possibility of editing it to make it seem like there was mutual interest.
 

 
Sister Chu comforted her: “Don’t worry; Chen Zhuzhi is just a cornered dog. He won’t have many opportunities to appear in front of you again. The only chance he might have to gain some popularity is by creating a CP with you, but he knows he doesn’t deserve it... unless you go crazy and fall in love with him.”
 

 
That possibility was extremely slim; Sister Chu knew her artist was completely focused on her career.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with an “mm.”
 

 
It was impossible for her to go crazy and fall in love with Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
However, while filming the show, Lu Xianchang really wanted to split him in half with a sword.
 

 
And the effect of the show’s airing was that Chen Zhuzhi kept awkwardly calling out to Tong Zhao as if he were acting strangely.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi did have some fans.
 

 
Those who knew he had an abusive ex-girlfriend yet still remained loyal to him were, one can imagine, a particular type. Not only were they not deterred by his desperate behavior, but they also targeted Tong Zhao in the comments and bullet screens.
 

 
[Chen Zhuzhi is still a senior; does Tong Zhao really need to be this rude?]
 

 
[Brother Zhu didn’t really confess to her; he just expressed admiration for a talented junior. Her reaction was too ugly.]
 

 
[Not a fan of anyone, but because of this attitude toward Tong Zhao in the promotion, I’m turning against her.]
 

 
However, the eyes of the crowd were sharp.
 

 
Just as they had begun to forget Chen Zhuzhi’s past misdeeds, Tong Zhao’s comment about the social news reminded them again.
 

 
Right, he’s a legal-themed celebrity!
 

 
Netizens helped to mock him back, while Tong Zhao’s fans had always been more laid-back...
 

 
Up until “The Sea King’s Kill.”
 

 
After “The Sea King’s Kill” aired, a special group emerged among Tong Zhao’s fans, not large in number but strong in combat power: the girlfriend fans of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were irrational and unreasonable, and Tong Zhao’s fans initially didn’t plan to pay them any attention. However, after several days of not seeing normal content and being bothered, some of the more sensitive fans even considered unfollowing her.
 

 
The so-called only magic can defeat magic came into play at that moment, as Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans rallied to protect their idol—
 

 
[Stop pretending to be bystanders; who besides the little punching bags would speak for the legal celebrity?]
 

 
[So heartbroken for her, being forced to promote alongside a scumbag.]
 

 
[Ew, could the legal-themed celebrity keep their distance from our sister? Be careful, or she might send your brother to the afterlife with a punch.]
 

 
Not only did they fight back, but they also provided various well-organized pieces of evidence against Chen Zhuzhi, proving his past wrongdoings.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were left dumbfounded.
 

 
This wasn’t right. In the past, whenever they targeted female celebrities’ fans, besides the occasional ridicule from bystanders, they never encountered any real opponents. Why did they hit a wall this time? The arguments sounded so familiar, almost like those from other male celebrities' fan wars.
 

 
Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans didn’t waste time arguing with them; they chased after Chen Zhuzhi for two days, and once they confirmed that his fans wouldn’t dare to fight back, they returned victorious.
 

 
Only confused Chen fans and onlookers were left behind.

# Chapter58
An analysis post suddenly appeared on a forum, and within half an hour, it became a hot topic.
 

 
Two hours later, the moderator highlighted it, showing just how exciting it was.
 

 
The poster was a new media writer who usually earned a living writing articles about mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts, bizarre matchmaking stories, workplace troubles, and similar topics. Occasionally, they would also post fabricated stories on various forums to drive traffic to their public account—essentially using sensational content to “entice” netizens to follow the thread, and when they couldn’t get enough, they would end with a tease: “To know more, please follow xxxxxx.”
 

 
There’s expertise in every field, and regardless of quality, writers of this kind know how to grab attention right from the start.
 

 
Moreover, this time, the information being revealed was genuine.
 

 
The poster first provided a brief summary of the background.
 

 
The gist of this story was straightforward, even for netizens who didn’t follow the entertainment industry.
 

 
It involved the fans of the female lead and the original male lead of the upcoming film ‘ Heartless Tribulation’, set to release next month, getting into a heated argument.
 

 
[Huh? Why are the male and female leads’ fans fighting? Is it over their roles?]
 

 
[What do you mean by “original male lead”?]
 

 
[It means that in ‘The Heartless Tribulation’, Tong Zhao kicked Chen Zhuzhi out of the main lead position.]
 

 
Thanks to the enthusiastic explanations from fans of instinctive films, bystanders quickly understood the situation.
 

 
Fair competition.
 

 
It was entirely normal for the subconscious not to perform well and to be outdone by others.
 

 
Since he signed a gambling contract, he should accept the outcome.
 

 
The poster then shared an edited clip from Chen Zhuzhi's promotional program, which heavily implied his desperation. If The female lead politely accepted the situation, even without explicitly reciprocating any feelings, she would likely end up being marketed as a sugar couple (CP) by the marketing team behind Chen Zhuzhi. He would effectively ride on the female lead's popularity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao almost carved the word "disdain" on her forehead.
 

 
The effort to create a CP (couple) turned into a one-sided attachment.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were not having it, and they began to act sarcastic across various forums and Weibo, staging a virtual Three Kingdoms battle—
 

 
Chen Fans (Loyal): "Brother is just kindly taking care of the junior, worried that Tong Zhao wouldn’t get enough screen time, so he mentioned her more. Who would have thought she would turn around and bite him? How about a little politeness from the junior?"
 

 
Chen Fans (Neutral): "Just two sides of fans enjoying the show, they didn’t see the male lead's desperation, only that Tong Zhao’s emotional intelligence is quite low."
 

 
Chen Fans (Opposition): "Chen is only fit to be our Zhao Zhao goddess's lapdog/laughs / laughs."
 

 
Loyalty masquerading as opposition, counter-fans, and fake bystanders...
 

 
A variety of advanced tactics that would leave even seasoned players in the Three Kingdoms game in awe kept emerging. Combined with their aggressive tactics in the forums, they had previously managed to provoke Tong Zhao’s generally passive fans to the point where they had no temper left to fight back—
 

 
Since she wasn't following the typical idol path, her management focused more energy and marketing budget on securing mid to high-end endorsements for her. As long as there weren’t any major issues, they basically ignored the data; as long as she was doing well, it was fine. After all, among her peers, Tong Zhao was already far ahead, and the general audience showed interest in her name in film and television works.
 

 
Netizens following the posts at the top floor marveled at the spectacle.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi was definitely not a top-tier actor among male actors.
 

 
He had been in the industry for a while, benefiting from the large population in China, where a smaller base was easier to manipulate. Moreover—
 

 
‘If I can't beat the fans of other male stars, how could I possibly lose to the fans of a female actor?’
 

 
This current state of affairs left netizens feeling a mix of pity and amusement.
 

 
[Why can't he win? Tong Zhao's recent works have been quite popular.]
 

 
Poster: "The law of the internet is that the more brainless you are, the more advantageous it becomes.”
 

 
Poster: "Actually, it's not just the fan community or the internet. Throughout history, countless civilizations have been trampled and destroyed by barbaric forces because barbarism often gives rise to greater military capabilities (of course, this has become rare since the nuclear era), but this phenomenon still occurs frequently online."
 

 
[66666]
 

 
[The poster is quite the cultured person. If you don’t have your big work at the next book fair, I’m not going.]
 

 
[It's not that fans are born brainless; it's that the toxic teams behind the stars find ways to nurture these mindless behaviors. Essentially, they are just legal large-scale multi-level marketing teams, which is unsolvable.]
 

 
Compared to smart people, it's much easier to make money off foolish ones.
 

 
Cutting leeks (a term for profiting off fans) from fans is just making money; there's nothing shameful about it.
 

 
Poster: "Chen Zhuzhi's fans had a good strategy; at first, Tong Zhao's fans indeed couldn’t compete."
 

 
Poster: "But they overlooked one point—"
 

 
Immediately after, the poster shared several screenshots.
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans were also pretty laid-back since there was no ranking to fight for.
 

 
Not long after ‘Sea King Kill’ aired, the perfume endorsement ad came out, and fans were just enjoying the visuals and boosting sales as their daily task. However, the fans of Chen Zhuzhi were running into trouble.
 

 
This official fan account was purely grassroots, and the head was a hot-tempered rich girl.
 

 
Ever since she started following Han Zhi, she put down her keyboard and was forced to adopt a more laid-back approach to fan culture, searching daily for her brother's name and chatting with her friends.
 

 
As a result, she stumbled upon the insults from Chen Zhuzhi's fans.
 

 
The head of the fan group understood the origin of the situation and, confirming it wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, immediately jumped in.
 

 
First screenshot:
 

 
@Han Zhi’s Fan Club: "Are you still cursing?"
 

 
[Han Zhi’s Plaza Screenshot.JPG]
 

 
The second screenshot showed that Chen Zhuzhi's fans had been counter-attacked for two days; no matter where they appeared in related trending news, they were immediately ridiculed to the point of being unrecognizable. The previous tactics of pretending to be neutral and incognito had all been exposed by Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans, with a clear chain of evidence and straightforward posters, making it easy to understand and direct, swiftly confusing the originally dominant male fans.
 

 
The attitudes of Han Zhi’s fans could be categorized into two types.
 

 
1:
 

 
Don’t think that Tong Zhao has no one; they’re all supporting her.
 

 
2:
 

 
Your brother’s desperate attempts to ride the wave of popularity are all too obvious. My side refuses to be tied down; for every time he tries to cling on, we’ll strike back.
 

 
The fan community has evidently developed into its own distinct system, with its own ecology and rules.
 

 
Onlookers were baffled, not understanding why Chen Zhuzhi’s fans were silenced so quickly.
 

 
The leader of Han Zhi’s fan group was a seasoned fangirl, aware that when engaging in battles, you have to hit the opponent where it hurts. Essentially, this was a display of force that inadvertently intimidated potential competitors.
 

 
After the poster provided some commentary, they concluded with a theatrical phrase:
 

 
[Perhaps the best way to maintain peace is for everyone to be armed.]
 

 
[Only magic can defeat magic. Through this example, we get a glimpse of a fan community rivalry. It’s worth pondering: what would happen if any non-idol actor were in the same situation?]
 

 
After being shared, netizens humorously referred to this as a perfect essay.
 

 
Not only did it pinpoint the central theme, but it also elevated the content.
 

 
……
 

 
“Reflecting on fan culture: Counting Chen Zhuzhi's seven deadly sins.”
 

 
“The truth behind the Tong Zhao and Chen Zhuzhi fan war— the desperate struggle of a washed-up celebrity.”
 

 
“In an era of instinctive filmmaking where skill cannot be enhanced through effort, has the dominance of the subconscious effectively stifled this industry...? Wow, this article seems quite favorable to Chen Zhuzhi but has a rather unique angle. However, the topic of instinctive filmmaking being unrelated to acting has been thoroughly discussed. Times change like this; we cannot alter the era, only adapt to it.”
 

 
Manager Chu loudly read three pieces of news.
 

 
What is Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
She’s intensely replying to messages on WeChat.
 

 
Perhaps due to having traversed many worlds, Tong Zhao is quite resilient to loneliness. Compared to her peers, she is a rare breed that doesn’t easily bow down. However, every time she finishes a gig or wraps up a film, her WeChat contacts grow longer…
 

 
She can ignore the guys, but she must reply to the girls to some extent.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao engrossed in her phone, Manager Chu, feeling a bit lonely, asked her, “We just won a brilliant victory. Aren’t you going to go over the details?”
 

 
“You handle it,” Tong Zhao replied, looking up and giving her a smile with her stunningly attractive face, “I trust you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Manager Chu thought to herself, “Trust you, my foot!”
 

 
She’s just too carefree. In the first couple of days, she was mercilessly attacked by Chen Zhuzhi’s fans, and her private messages were filled with bloody, disgusting images. Yet she didn’t waver even slightly and seemed to be having fun, casually downloading two particularly horrifying images to send to Wei Zekai. In the end, her manager dealt with everything.
 

 
Of course, the company wasn’t just idly sitting by.
 

 
That post was crafted by a skilled professional that manager Chu hired, along with a series of paid articles.
 

 
Even if Chen Zhuzhi’s fans didn’t confront Han Zhi’s fans directly, the company had long been prepared to fight back and debunk rumors. This time, the counterattack was executed perfectly, and Tong Zhao’s manager shifted from being the main attacker to providing support. Not only did they play their cards well, but when the other side misplayed, they struck back and declared, “I heard Zanchao Entertainment has already given up on Chen Zhuzhi and left him to fend for himself.”
 

 
“Sounds good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded in appreciation.
 

 
How could she maintain a lofty attitude while being in the industry?
 

 
At the very least, she needed to know how to protect herself. She wouldn’t actively suppress others through underhanded tactics, but she didn’t want anyone to provoke her either.
 

 
Honestly, being protected by her female fans felt quite nice.
 

 
The issue with Chen Zhuzhi's fans came to a conclusion, and there was no possibility of the two collaborating again.
 

 
“Let’s not talk about this unfortunate matter anymore,” manager Chu perked up. “How are you considering the invitation to the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had already been looking into the arrangements for the Litchi TV New Year’s Gala.
 

 
They had invited her to perform on stage.
 

 
Litchi TV is a major platform. Although Tong Zhao was popular, she was still a rising star, and it was unlikely they would give her a solo performance at such an important event. They had invited Song Wanzhuo as well, thinking of creating some buzz with a couple’s act, singing a traditional duet. The specific song hadn’t been finalized yet, but the male side had no objections; they were just waiting for her input. Tong Zhao chatted with Song Wanzhuo on WeChat for a while and felt quite comfortable about it, seeing it as a chance to give a little treat to the ancient couple’s fans.
 

 
What she said was: “It’s a pity we don’t have couple vibes.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied: “That’s hard to say; sometimes I feel a strong connection, and other times I think of you as my buddy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about it and figured that Song Wanzhuo probably only liked her portrayal as Concubine Chen.
 

 
This was normal.
 

 
“Liking all sides of you” is a type of filter; in reality, most people’s affection for someone usually stems from a specific trait, which then expands to a broader understanding—like how Song Wanzhuo was captivated by Concubine Chen’s multifaceted charm, leaving a lasting impression that was hard to forget. Ordinary people often grapple with thoughts like “Does he really like me, or just the version of me that’s XXX?” So, it was even more complicated for someone as multifaceted as Tong Zhao.
 

 
Both Tong Zhao and her manager didn’t want to miss this opportunity to appear.
 

 
Singing alongside Song Wanzhuo was considered a strong collaboration, so they tentatively agreed.
 

 
Manager Chu asked, “Do you want me to find you a teacher?”
 

 
She was worried that Tong Zhao might not know how to sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied that it wasn’t necessary; she could sing.
 

 
She didn’t sing much herself, but she had sung a lot out of boredom in ancient times.
 

 
After all, she had to serve others with her talents, and she was skilled in singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments: “I can play the piece; I can also handle the accompaniment.”
 

 
Manager Chu glanced at her.
 

 
She understood her competitive nature too well; once she stepped on stage, she aimed to do her best. Though she acted nonchalant, in reality, she was determined to steal the show and wouldn’t miss any opportunity to shine. Such an artist was just…
 

 
So easy to manage!
 

 
“Okay, I’ll communicate with the director.”
 

 
Manager Chu was satisfied.
 

 
The music director of Litchi TV approved the request, and the final song was set to be a duet of “A Smile Captivates the Heart,” with her playing the accompaniment. Song Wanzhuo’s manager initially had some concerns, feeling it would overshadow the male lead, and that it would be fairer if they all sang together. However, Song Wanzhuo had a strong opinion and influence in the company; he wanted to see his goddess play the guzheng. What was wrong with letting her take some of the spotlight? Men shouldn’t be so petty.
 

 
Once this was settled, the news was released.
 

 
Originally, the hottest news surrounding Tong Zhao was the completion of "Heartless Tribulation" and her feud with Chen Zhuzhi, but when the public saw the guest list for Litchi TV's New Year’s Gala, they thought, “Oh wow, Tong Zhao is going to be there, and she’ll be singing with Song Wanzhuo!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's reputation and accomplishments far surpassed those of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
The latter’s fans didn’t dare to provoke him.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo posted a very formal Weibo thanking for the collaboration opportunity and tagged the official account of “The Legend of Ming Emperor.” Fans recalled that this was one of his important works, and many new fans had come from that drama. They were simply happy for him to see the Ming Emperor and his concubine on stage together for New Year’s.
 

 
[Supporting the joint performance, will you wear formal wear that day? Why not just wear the costumes from the drama?]
 

 
[Thanks to Litchi TV for the invitation; we’ll see you on New Year’s, big brother!]
 

 
[Seeing through my brother's restrained joy/dog emoji]
 

 
[What? The Song-Zhao couple is resurrecting and giving us sweetness?]
 

 
The fourth comment was relatively discordant.
 

 
The super topic for this ancient couple had long been neglected; no one managed it anymore, and only drama fans occasionally mentioned it.
 

 
When "Sea King Kill" premiered, Song Wanzhuo made sure his fans knew about his admiration for Tong Zhao. His direct and playful way of fandom brought some outside heat and goodwill from bystanders. Fans politely clarified things, and after realizing there were no further ambiguous signs between the two, they felt reassured.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi's fans were incredibly frustrated.
 

 
After being mocked a few times and not seeing any chance for a comeback, they scattered like monkeys when the tree fell, all jumping ship.
 

 
This series of discussions brought some heat to "Heartless Tribulation," allowing this big female lead fantasy film to enter the public's view, ranking first in the most anticipated releases list by a significant margin.
 

 
In the era of instinctive cinema, films are made quickly and released even faster.
 

 
Bad movies can result in huge losses, while the winners take it all.
 

 
#Movie "Heartless Tribulation" Premiere#
 

 
#Tong Zhao#
 

 
#Shi Qianqiu#
 

 
How high are the audience’s expectations for this movie?
 

 
From the day "Heartless Tribulation" was released, the number of visitors to the holographic mall clearly reflected this.
 

 
Although it was a weekend holiday, the data flow from netizens clearly indicated one thing — they were going to watch the movie, and it was Tong Zhao's "Heartless Tribulation."
 

 
The advantage of holographic viewing is that you can still get tickets even when the crowd is huge.
 

 
However, the rooms set up by streamers to chat with fans during the viewing do have a limit on the number of participants. Even small streamers can attract a lot of netizens when they tag "Heartless Tribulation," which is a clear indication of how popular this movie is.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi has been relegated to a supporting role.
 

 
It’s obvious who attracts the public and who carries the box office.
 

 
At the offline premiere of "Heartless Tribulation," Tong Zhao wore a pearl-white evening gown, the skirt adorned with layers of scattered diamonds. Her manager repeatedly reminded her that the team had invested heavily in this dress, and her presence had to live up to their efforts:
 

 
“We don’t intend to give Chen Zhuzhi any face; tonight, you are the absolute star.”
 

 
“I know you have a good relationship with the other two female supporting roles, but you must outshine everyone tonight.”
 

 
Tong Zhao fully understood.
 

 
She initially planned to attend alone, but after hearing that the character Concubine Chen could steal the show, she eagerly requested to take the lead role for a while. Tong Zhao readily agreed, as they shared success and would face challenges together.
 

 
A female reporter teased her: "A movie starring Lu Xianzhang lets you steal the spotlight?"
 

 
Concubine Chen replied: "I work the fields while the horse eats grain; if the other side makes money, I enjoy the benefits. There's no shame in that."
 

 
Since recovering her memories from "Heartless Tribulation," Lu Xianzhang seemed to have new insights and had been secluded, so she naturally did not come out to confront concubine Chen at this moment.
 

 
To withstand the grandeur of the event, Tong Zhao’s makeup and hairstyle today were particularly elaborate.
 

 
The dress was tightly fitted at the waist, accentuating her graceful curves.
 

 
The makeup artist applied highlighter to her body, making her a luxury item that was expensive, beautiful, and of high taste —
 

 
Stepping out of the car with the aura of "outshining the crowd," she descended from the ceremonial vehicle.
 

 
Countless flashbulbs lit up concubine Chen, as if she had been washed by a rain of light. Long cameras and short ones aimed at her face, wanting to capture her most authentic side. Unscrupulous media outlets aimed to photograph her less flattering angles, knowing that flawed photos are often more eye-catching.
 

 
However, there was nothing to capture.
 

 
Even in rapid-fire snapshots, no flaws could be detected.
 

 
In this crowded and scrutinized occasion, concubine Chen recalled the grand ceremony where she was conferred as a noble consort, with countless ladies bowing deeply to her. She lazily swept her gaze over their bowed heads, feeling a swell of power and a hint of bored indifference…
 

 
This surplus of confidence elevated concubine Chen's radiant makeup, making all the precious jewels adorning her simply embellishments to her beauty; no matter how large or dazzling the gems, they could not overshadow her brilliance.
 

 
Concubine Chen had only one thought —
 

 
Why didn’t these people kneel down while taking her picture?
 

 
……
 

 
The aura of the noble consort was overwhelming; whether it was the front-line stand-ins, media reporters, or simply the lucky audience members who received premiere invitations, every candid shot that circulated online was stunning.
 

 
[So beautiful, wow! Let me appreciate the empress's beauty.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's looks are truly exceptional. I actually think Chen Zhuzhi might not just be trying to ride on her fame; he genuinely likes her. Who can resist a beautiful woman?]
 

 
[Demon monsters, please leave! Can we stop mentioning that person?]
 

 
While anxiously waiting for the "Confirm Viewing" button to change from gray to green, netizens could only refresh various news related to the premiere, resulting in wave after wave of Tong Zhao's event photos.
 

 
Of course, she was undeniably the first female lead.
 

 
But "Heartless Tribulation" didn't just have her in it; they had to give others some screen time too, right?
 

 
Just as netizens were calling for more photos of others, pictures of Tong Zhao alongside her co-stars were released.
 

 
Uh...
 

 
[Is this a photo of a big star with a regular beauty?]
 

 
[What happened to Jiao Jiao? Ugh, the stylist should be punished!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s dress can’t be cheap; her team is really impressive.]
 

 
It’s not just about the evening gown.
 

 
If it were Tong Zhao, she might consider letting her girlfriends shine together and look beautiful in group photos, but who is concubine Chen? She’s not anti-female nor targeting the same sex; she equally looks down on everyone. She wants to outshine the crowd and make sure the emperor sees only her!
 

 
Concubine Chen never threatens the other consorts to appear barefaced.
 

 
Nor does she fear them sending the emperor secret glances.
 

 
Because with her present, it’s useless for the other consorts to dress up like golden statues.
 

 
The aura effect that the system can extract is beyond comparison.
 

 
In short, the outcome of that group photo was nothing short of disastrous.
 

 
In modern society, there are no emperors, and at the premiere, there isn't a very important domineering CEO that concubine Chen needs to flatter and please. The concubine doesn’t know what it means to know when to back off. Her presence was felt throughout the event, and every male guest attending the premiere was captivated by her charm.
 

 
Wasn't the agent telling Tong Zhao to perform well and outshine everyone?
 

 
Well, what she did was a perfect score. No thanks needed; just kneel in admiration.
 

 
Before the screening began, concubine Chen, satisfied, went to rest, while Tong Zhao sat down in her pre-arranged seat and rubbed her forehead.
 

 
Brother Duan: "Zhao Zhao, were you asleep just now? I suggest you check your WeChat."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, let the concubine handle the socializing for me. What’s up?"
 

 
Brother Duan: "Uh... you’ll know when you see it."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the big screen.
 

 
She realized the movie hadn't started yet, so she took out her phone from her handbag and opened WeChat.
 

 
She discovered that there was a new category added in her contacts—
 

 
Fish Pond:
 

 
- Director of Litchi Entertainment
 
- Music Director of North China
 
- Executive of Yunsanglong Culture
 
- ...
 

 
The list was astonishingly long.
 

 
It was hard to imagine how so many people could be added in such a short time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Concubine, let’s talk."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "They’re all fools who would give up their entire fortune just to see me smile a couple of times. I’ll keep them around; they’re useful. Don’t worry, I’m very good at managing personal space. No one will try to pull any hidden rules on you; their admiration will only stay at the level of appreciation and adoration. They all wanted to add me themselves."
 

 
Hearing this, it was clear she was an old pro at this game.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Hiss.”
 

 
If her life were a stock trading novel, readers would probably have no idea whose stocks to buy.
 

 
She could only indulge her own personality and flirt blindly.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t angry; she just took it as a chance to show her face.
 

 
The seats for the male and female leads were initially arranged together, but manager Chu directly discussed with Shi Qianqiu, explaining that her artist didn’t want to sit next to Chen Zhuzhi. Could they make some adjustments? Shi Qianqiu readily agreed, so the seating was changed to Tong Zhao sitting between Fu Xiaoheng and him.
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was overjoyed and whispered, "Master, Master!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao thought she had broken character.
 

 
If it were a male actor like Song Wanzhuo, Tong Zhao would have snapped him out of it right then and there. But she had a bit more patience with girls. She wanted to ask Lu Xianzhang to come out and socialize with her apprentice, but since Lu Xianzhang was in a silent retreat, she gave up that thought and silently noted that Fu Xiaoheng was out of luck: "I’m here. What’s up?"
 

 
"I’m really happy to see you. Ever since I regained my memories, I’ve wanted to call you Master."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng was actually a generation older than Tong Zhao, and when she smiled, there were fine lines at the corners of her eyes.
 

 
However, influenced by the memories from "Heartless Tribulation," she looked at Tong Zhao with adoring eyes, like a complete little fan.
 

 
This is one of the downsides of modern filmmaking!
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Yeah, go ahead and call me that."
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng wanted to reminisce further.
 

 
But at that moment, the lights dimmed around them, and the screen slowly lit up…
# Chapter59
There is a saying commonly passed around:
 

 
"If you haven't acted in an instinctive movie, you've wasted your life."
 

 
Instinctive movies have an insatiable demand for extras.
 

 
For ordinary people, becoming an extra is not something unattainable. Many have "appearing in an instinctive movie" on their list of "things to accomplish before turning twenty," and many teenagers say that only after experiencing an instinctive movie do they realize how ordinary their "true selves" really are.
 

 
The experience of acting in an instinctive movie is also extremely unique.
 

 
The memories recalled in the mind are from a first-person perspective, which is different from the viewing angle when watching sample footage.
 

 
The final edited version, after post-production, is yet another thing altogether—
 

 
Since entering the era of instinctive movies, one of the most crucial tasks for directors has been film editing.
 

 
After the actors wrap up, Shi Qianqiu and his editing team "enter" ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ countless times, repeatedly using their own ideas and aesthetics to create the final version.
 

 
For instance, Tong Zhao had to go back and reshoot several scenes depicting Mu Yingchen and Shao Xuanzheng's memories when they were still a dual-cultivation couple.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang's subconscious couldn't handle acting out his dual cultivation life, so Tong Zhao had to step in herself to barely manage the plot setting of "the two being a couple" and complete the flashback scenes.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt she didn't do a good job in that segment.
 

 
At that time, Shi Qianqiu reassured her, saying he had a way to edit the scenes later, adding some details to make it more convincing.
 

 
If good subconscious performances from actors are like lyrics, the director is the composer.
 

 
Thus, the birth of good work requires both.
 

 
Tong Zhao was also curious how Shi Qianqiu would use editing to make up for her stiff performance... The Mu Yingchen she portrayed, although not outright cutting him down with a sword, showed a cold, disinterested attitude—a clear indication of a superficial relationship. There was no way to convey the contrast of someone who once deeply loved her husband, only to sever all ties after being betrayed.
 

 
The entire hall darkened completely.
 

 
...
 

 
The screen lit up with a classic aerial view of the Nine Provinces.
 

 
Many towering mountains shrouded in clouds came into view, followed by smooth cuts—
 

 
A vast, desolate, snow-covered icy landscape appeared, and in this barren whiteness, a slender, tall figure was captured in a low-to-high shot. Her jet-black hair fell gracefully, and she was the only trace of darkness in the scene, naturally drawing the audience's attention to her silhouette.
 

 
Then, she turned around.
 

 
Everyone knew this should be the female lead, Tong Zhao.
 

 
Almost all the audience knew what Tong Zhao looked like.
 

 
She’s been incredibly popular lately, and everyone must be very familiar with her face!
 

 
However, in that fleeting moment when she turned around, the audience was still stunned by her beauty, holding their breath for a second, unwilling to blink—
 

 
The moonlight illuminated Tong Zhao's face, cold and flawless.
 

 
If ordinary celestial maidens are like the distant, unattainable mist and clouds, then she is the wind and snow in a lonely, desolate mountain—proud and cold, with an air of solitary elegance. Her beautiful face was slightly raised, and as the snowflakes were about to land on her long lashes, they were shattered into powder by an invisible sword aura, dissolving into the wind before they could touch her.
 

 
[Oh my God, is she the real celestial being!]
 

 
[How can the same face be so powerful? Or is Tong Zhao actually a set of triplets? Although the face is the same, there are three different people behind it! The temperament is so distinct!]
 

 
[Got myself a stunning screensaver. Director Shi still knows how to shoot grand scenes. You can tell he’s a young master from a wealthy family.]
 

 
[This modeling isn’t just blowing wind and snow; it’s blowing money.]
 

 
The audience felt as though they were seeing her anew.
 

 
Amateurs focus on the spectacle, while experts see the technique.
 

 
Some film critics were already whispering to each other about Tong Zhao’s subconscious performance highlights this time.
 

 
Instinctive films of different genres each have their own challenges. For fantasy and immortal-themed films, it’s rare for anyone to capture the ethereal aura in the details.
 

 
It’s not just about having a pretty face.
 

 
Some subconscious performances, even if capable of summoning lightning with one hand and calling rain with the other, still come across as ordinary when dressed in a grand mage’s robe.
 

 
However, Lu Xianzhang’s subconscious, with just this single detail, allowed the audience to easily accept the image of "a cultivator"—these were all habits deeply ingrained in her subconscious daily life.
 

 
“Immortal Shao,”
 

 
Even her voice was cold, carrying a chill that could sting the face, with a hint of doubt: “Did you come all the way from the Nanhua Sword Sect just to meet me for the second time?”
 

 
Then, a series of montages conveyed to the audience the story of the two meeting, falling in love, and becoming cultivation partners.
 

 
“I, Shao Xuanzheng, vow by the sword in my hand and the path I uphold, to love only Mu Yingchen in this life.”
 

 
The clear and cheerful male voice echoed through the sky.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng, with a high-spirited look, his hair tied with a long hairpin, his handsome face complemented by his sky-blue robe, stood on a high platform like a nobleman stepping out of a painting. The light behind him outlined a glowing edge around him...
 

 
Tong Zhao finally understood what Shi Qianqiu meant by "a little detail."
 

 
In this long opening flashback, he made the male lead look particularly handsome, using various angles with ample surrounding light.
 

 
Next, he edited it as if it was the male lead through the eyes of the female lead—
 

 
The long shot showed her gazing at him with a pounding heart.
 

 
The medium shot showed them exchanging meaningful glances.
 

 
The close-up showed her lingering gaze, full of reluctance to part.
 

 
The idea is that when you like someone, you see them with a halo around them.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu used this mindset to draw the audience’s attention while guiding their thoughts in the direction he intended—that the female lead deeply loved the male lead, admired his charisma, and saw him through a thick, ten-layer filter of admiration.
 

 
Tong Zhao, watching with a detached and calm attitude, actually found herself convinced.
 

 
Seeing everyone around her engrossed in the movie, she knew she couldn’t engage in unprofessional behavior like whispering throughout the film, nor could she play on her phone and send WeChat messages. She had a strong urge to share her thoughts but had nowhere to express them—thankfully, she still had "herself"—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Wow, it really looks like I was madly in love with the male lead.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [The director has quite an artistic vision.]
 

 
Usually the most talkative, Concubine Chen was silent. Tong Zhao thought she might have been upset by the earlier comment about her switching partners rapidly and was about to console her when she heard brother Duan say: [She just woke Lu Xianzhang up forcefully.]
 

 
What happened?
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Quick, look at the movie scene Zhaozhao just saw. That’s your character.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang wasn’t keen on responding, but since they shared the same person and the same brain, the memories were shared. When Lu Xianzhang saw herself deeply in love with Shao Xuanzheng through Shi Qianqiu’s romantic editing, even someone as experienced as her almost had a minor breakdown: [......]
 

 
So, Lu Xianzhang, having just appeared, quickly withdrew into seclusion again.
 

 
Concubine Chen was delighted and joyfully fanned herself.
 

 
Apart from Tong Zhao and the post-production team of “The Heartless Tribulation”, who knew the truth, the rest of the audience was completely immersed in the movie's storyline. In the first less-than-ten-minute opening, the director sparingly gave the female lead few scenes, focusing more on "Shao Xuanzheng as seen through the eyes of the female lead." But whenever she appeared, every frame was unforgettable.
 

 
She was practicing swordsmanship alone on the peak of Nanhua Sword Sect.
 

 
In the past, she was "Immortal Mu" or "Fairy Yingchen." Now, people called her "Immortal Shao's partner."
 

 
After her master ascended, she returned to the immortal sect once and stood for a long time before the cliff engraved with the words "Heart Severance Peak."
 

 
The snow-white robe, once perfectly fitted, now seemed oversized on her, conveying a sense of loneliness and suggesting through visual cues that her post-marriage life outside the sect had not been happy.
 

 
There had been verbal disputes between the two.
 

 
Mu Yingchen's cultivation level was higher than his, but she never liked to argue with him. Each conflict ended in an unpleasant and unresolved manner.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu really knows how to film beautiful women.]
 

 
[Chen Zhuozhi’s performance doesn’t seem bad here? Why was he relegated to a supporting role?]
 

 
[“Not bad” my foot! Stay away from Fairy Yingchen! Zhaozhao should shine alone!]
 

 
In the first fifteen minutes, the crew successfully portrayed a reticent and aloof "Immortal Mu," whom the audience became accustomed to seeing always dressed in spotless white, with a flawless face. Though her perfection seemed almost unreal, it was still enjoyable—who doesn’t love watching a beauty?
 

 
A great beauty just needs to be responsible for being beautiful!
 

 
Besides, she was so powerful.
 

 
Was Tong Zhao's subconscious too strong, turning ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ into a movie where the heroine remains stunning throughout? It's not impossible. ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’ was also a film where she single-handedly dominated the entire show, and the response was good. Short, highly-praised reviews said that movie was both stress-relieving and exhilarating to watch.
 

 
Just as the audience began to wonder how the story would unfold, the hints laid earlier started to come together—
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng was jealous of his partner’s talent and longed for his first love, his “white moonlight.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen never guarded against him.
 

 
At least, that’s the information conveyed through the editing.
 

 
When the audience saw Shao Xuanzheng plotting multiple schemes to poison her and destroy her golden core while she was weak, the comment section exploded:
 

 
[Oh my god, this scumbag is inhuman!]
 

 
[Fairy Yingchen’s golden core is so beautiful, just as bright and pure as she is, QAQ.]
 

 
[I want to buy Golden Core merchandise!]
 

 
[Shao, you bastard! Also, to the person who wants to buy the heroine's golden core merchandise, you successfully made me hold back my tears.]
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s golden core was shattered, and Shao Xuanzheng gleefully recounted how much he had endured her arrogance and pride over the years, and how he finally didn’t have to bear it anymore. Mu Yingchen just looked at him quietly, her beautiful face even paler than when she was in the freezing wasteland, but her eyes were still cold and bright: “Your plan succeeded not because I was arrogant, not because you were more cunning than me, but because you were despicable and vile enough, while I never guarded against my own partner.”
 

 
In the special viewing section, several familiar film critics were whispering their thoughts: “No matter what kind of adversity she faces, we’ve never seen Tong Zhao’s subconscious give up. This seems to be a common trait in many of her characters.”
 

 
“That’s what makes her subconscious so likable.”
 

 
“These lines are quite emotional, unlike what Shi Qianqiu would write. It must have been an impromptu addition from Tong Zhao’s subconscious.”
 

 
They nodded in agreement.
 

 
As if responding to the critics' words, the following scenes showed the fairy, who had been so perfectly portrayed in the first fifteen minutes, having her wings broken, pressed into the cold river, her soft black hair disheveled, and her once-pure white robe stained with blood, now in tatters.
 

 
The contrast was devastating.
 

 
Mu Yingchen, once so proud and clean, had been completely humiliated and used up by her lover.
 

 
The previously lively fans of Tong Zhao in the comment section went silent halfway through, while those who weren’t quiet were passionately cursing Shao Xuanzheng. Casual viewers, feeling sorry for the heroine’s plight, started discussing off-topic matters—what kind of person would Chen Zhuzhi be in real life to play such a despicable role?
 

 
The comment section then erupted with a round of gossip about Chen Zhuzhi’s controversies.
 

 
The first mini-climax of the first half came when Mu Yingchen, barely recovering from her serious injuries, cut off her own left hand in order to escape.
 

 
How painful must that have been!
 

 
But her face showed almost no expression, so calm it didn’t seem like she was cutting off her own hand.
 

 
Thus, everyone assumed Tong Zhao had the pain immunity mode on.
 

 
However, with the pain immunity fully activated, there would be logical inconsistencies, and the actors in the scene would sense something was off, so it wasn’t 100% pain immunity.
 

 
[Even at the maximum of 70%, it must still hurt a lot. Tong Zhao’s subconscious is truly resilient. Remember last time when she removed a bullet from her thigh wound? If there’s a big-budget action movie, they should definitely consider our girl.]
 

 
[No, no, no, no, please no. Just make some art films. It breaks my heart to see my wife getting hurt!]
 

 
After the heroine escaped, she stumbled upon the Li family caravan heading up the mountain.
 

 
This is a common trope in movies: first showing the protagonist in a pitiful and downtrodden state, while the villains appear glamorous and powerful. It’s a classic formula that the audience understands, but it still effectively stirs emotions. People want to see the protagonist turn the tables and get revenge, eagerly awaiting what’s next. But...
 

 
Renowned film critic Chen Shiyun sighed, “This girl really has an amazing presence. She’s so captivating. Even when she’s in rags, leaning against a tree in the dark, taking up only a small corner of the frame, I still can’t help but focus on her.”
 

 
The female critic next to him gave him a sidelong glance.
 

 
During the pre-screening event earlier, Chen Shiyun had been eagerly chatting with Tong Zhao, even exchanging WeChat contacts with her. After she left, he looked completely smitten, like he had fallen head over heels in love. She whispered to another female critic, “This must be what men are like.”
 

 
However, she had to admit that Tong Zhao had indeed captured seventy percent of her attention just now.
 

 
Even though Ding Jiao, who played Li Qiaoqiao, was dressed in exquisite clothes with numerous maids and servants around her, she still didn’t have that commanding presence. If there were points to be deducted from “Heartless Tribulation”, they would start with how it failed to suppress Tong Zhao’s presence.
 

 
But was that Ding Jiao’s fault for not being captivating enough, or was it Tong Zhao’s subconscious being too compelling?
 

 
It could only be said that competing on the same stage with such a "monster" is a kind of torment.
 

 
It seems that whether on or off screen, Ding Jiao could only serve as a foil to Tong Zhao...
 

 
The female critic who favored Ding Jiao sighed inwardly while giving Tong Zhao even higher marks in her notes.
 

 
The earlier scenes focused mostly on dialogue, and one critic remarked, “The opening showed the heroine practicing swordsmanship. Will there be action scenes showcasing her skills next? Or will it be purely magical combat? Shi Qianqiu’s films always involve a wave of expensive special effects.”
 

 
“That would be a waste of Tong Zhao’s subconscious,” another critic replied. “I fell in love with her because of ‘Countdown: 72 Hours’.”
 

 
“Haha, her action scenes in that movie were really impressive.”
 

 
Film critics are more sensitive to visual information than the average audience, and they tend to watch with a more detached mindset.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen discovered the woman locked up in the hunter’s cabin, many in the audience gasped, expecting the protagonist to unleash her power and rescue her. Tong Zhao’s subconscious was so calm and composed that it made the audience temporarily forget her dire situation—that she was currently a shattered Golden Core cultivator, with barely any spiritual power left and one hand severed.
 

 
“Oh? Instead of meeting a powerful ally, the protagonist encounters someone even weaker.” A critic expressed interest in Shi Qianqiu’s plot arrangement.
 

 
Male critics began discussing this point.
 

 
Meanwhile, the female critics, after exchanging opinions, found that they all liked this development.
 

 
Who needs a powerful ally?
 

 
Having Tong Zhao solo the entire scene is more than enough!
 

 
When Qingniang insisted that this “strange woman” was sure to save her, and Mu Yingchen reluctantly replied, “Alright, maybe you’re right,” the audience burst into small bursts of knowing laughter. The screen was filled with comments like [She really did it]—
 

 
Immediately afterward, Tong Zhao delivered a beautifully choreographed fight scene, drawing the audience, who had briefly relaxed, back into a state of tense focus.
 

 
[Another movie without a single dull moment.]
 

 
[Is this how one goes from an extra to a supporting role? Tong Zhao really took her on as an apprentice!]
 

 
[Damn, I’m so jealous of Qingniang. I want to be her apprentice too!]
 

 
After the initial satisfaction, the audience began repeating the call to become her apprentice.
 

 
Who wouldn’t want such a beautiful and powerful master?
 

 
By now, the main storyline of the movie had become very clear.
 

 
Compared to the female lead’s journey to find the divine sword and seek revenge, Shao Xuanzheng’s scenes were far less engaging. The director begrudgingly provided only some brief explanatory shots. Fans of Chen Zhuzhi were angrily criticizing Shi Qianqiu’s brutal editing for marginalizing their beloved actor, but their complaints were quickly drowned out by the mainstream voices.
 

 
Who cares about the scumbag's debauchery? The audience wanted to see more interactions between Mu Yingchen and her disciple.
 

 
In the first half-hour, the audience was introduced to Mu Yingchen’s ethereal, otherworldly side.
 

 
In the following half-hour, the audience gradually got to know her warm and endearing side... Actually, the Immortal Master wasn’t being cute, it was just her interactions with her disciple that were adorable. It was a classic “Clueless and Grumpy” duo that the audience fell for without even realizing it.
 

 
[Immortal Master: I’m fasting, but my disciple’s grilled fish? Hand it over.]
 

 
[Immortal Master, just spoil her already!]
 

 
[The orange dynamic is set, let the scumbag die quickly.]
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is certainly not a yuri film, and the director didn’t mislead the audience. It was made very clear that Qingniang’s feelings for her master are purely admiration and trust, transcending romantic love—a steadfast choice...
 

 
And that makes it even more shippable!
 

 
What's the point of shipping an official CP? It’s the ones that are explicitly denied that are the most fun to ship.
 

 
Tong Zhao has worked with the "big wolf dog" Song Wanzhuo and played a couple with the "little puppy" Tang Jingjie, but neither CP made much of a splash. After filming, the hype faded away quickly. No one expected that later on, this master-disciple pair would become Tong Zhao's most prolific and popular fan-created CP.
 

 
Back to the film.
 

 
When the disciple was about to sacrifice herself to the furnace, an orange-colored comment shot across the screen—
 

 
[The master-disciple CP is real! Mom, I’m shipping it for real!]
 

 
The discussion was still mostly about the plot.
 

 
[Qingniang hates being used so much, but she’s willing to let her master use her...]
 

 
[No, little disciple, don’t die! Are there any Shi Qianqiu fans here? He wouldn’t be so cruel, right?]
 

 
[Don’t get your hopes up about Shi the Scoundrel’s conscience. He’s a disciple of Gen Urobuchi.]
 

 
[Urobuchi, put down that pen!!]
 

 
Mu Yingchen, on her journey to find the divine sword with her little disciple, was far more relaxed and happy than during her dual cultivation period with Shao Xuanzheng. The sweetness in the middle was so intense that the audience didn’t realize there were blades hidden in the candy until now, leaving them unexpectedly chewing on shards of glass, mouths bleeding, and tears falling.
 

 
Xu Xiaoheng, who played the little disciple, had tears in her eyes.
 

 
She glanced surreptitiously at Tong Zhao...
 

 
Off-screen, Tong Zhao sat upright, her heavily made-up face showing no emotion. There was no hint of distraction, only contemplation. Xu Xiaoheng felt a bit disheartened as she looked away, thinking that Tong Zhao truly lived up to her superstar status, remaining unaffected by the emotions in the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Didn’t expect it—Immortal Lu is a potential lesbian heartbreaker too.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [“Thank you, luckily I’m very straightforward.”]
 

 
Tong Zhao watched the movie she starred in with the same mindset as an esports player reviewing match footage—purely analytical, unaffected by the memories and emotions involved.
 

 
When Mu Yingchen pinned her disciple down and leaped into the roaring sword furnace, the comments were filled with shock and tears.
 

 
There were also some out-of-place comments:
 

 
[“Jojo, I’m not human anymore!”]
 

 
[“...Refund my tears!”]
 

 
[“I beg the brothers in front of me, crying and laughing really looks insane.”]
 

 
At this point, "Heartless Tribulation" officially entered the thrilling segment of continuous climaxes. Clichéd, as it may be, executing it well, isn’t easy; audiences need to feel satisfied for the box office to do well. The director stopped toying with the audience, generously granting the protagonist a powerful boost, allowing her to make a grand comeback.
 

 
The pacing from setup to explosion was handled perfectly by the director.
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s subconscious has an advantage; her comebacks are always satisfying. Even a director with basic aesthetics can edit them well,” said one film critic.
 

 
“Exactly, Tong Zhao’s scene here,” one critic who preferred domestic animation recalled an older traditional film: “It reminds me of the climax in ‘White Snake’ when Sun Wukong breaks his seal due to Jiang Liuer’s death, igniting with red light—a moment that, if captured well, would be memorable and exhilarating.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen’s astonishing sword strike reduced Shao Xuanzheng to ashes.
 

 
In the end, the scumbag was left with nothing.
 

 
...
 

 
After the movie concluded, thunderous applause erupted in the venue.
 

 
The lights gradually brightened, and the list of creators began to roll. Below, Chen Zhuzhi found his name in the cast section, his fist clenched so tightly he nearly broke his fake smile. Next came the interview and Q&A segment, with the crew heading to the designated press area. After this, there would be an after-party exclusively for special guests...
 

 
Of course, this would be a gathering for various bigwigs and critics, heavily imbued with socializing and networking.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked her, “I edited it well, right?”
 

 
“It’s good,” Tong Zhao acknowledged, “especially that opening segment; I can’t believe you managed to cut it so emotionally.”
 

 
“I added a million little details.”
 

 
They spoke in hushed tones under the excited camera flashes, like two artists discussing the beautiful scenes of a film. Many of the positive reports from this premiere featured that candid shot.
 

 
The audience applauded more enthusiastically to invite the crew members on stage.
 

 
The main cast of "Heartless Tribulation" was quite small, primarily thanks to Shi Qianqiu, who served as producer, investor, screenwriter, and director all in one, thereby consolidating several key roles and simplifying things.
 

 
The order of questions had already been arranged.
 

 
After the screening, the online audience dispersed as well.
 

 
They might remain immersed in the excitement of the film for a while, sharing their thoughts on social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and various forums. However, that was a matter for public relations and marketing companies to monitor. Only the more dedicated fans and actor supporters stayed for the interview segment.
 

 
The first questions were posed by well-known authoritative media outlets, and the queries were quite standard.
 

 
“First of all, congratulations on making such an excellent film,” the reporter said formulaically before continuing, “I understand that ‘Heartless Tribulation’ was originally an experimental film with two protagonists. Such a large production for an experiment could only be achieved by Director Shi. So why did it end up becoming a single-protagonist film?”
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi’s smile gradually faded.
 

 
“I’m very fair,”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied with a smile. “Whoever performs well gets to be the protagonist; if she can steal the show, that’s her talent. I truly didn’t expect her to excel to the point of exhibiting overwhelming dominance… The final cut of the film is essentially a single-protagonist movie; adding anyone else wouldn’t fit.”
 

 
A reporter, sensing a point of contention, asked, “Is Tong Zhao’s performance significantly better than Chen Zhuzhi’s? What does the actress herself think?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, “The result is right there in the movie; you all saw it just now.”
 

 
Why even ask?
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi felt a murderous urge rising within him.
 

 
However, he didn’t dare contradict Shi Qianqiu and could only respond stiffly, “Of course, I’m willing to cooperate with the director’s arrangements.”
 

 
The reporter then asked a few questions about box office predictions and marketing plans, which made the fans feel drowsy until the second half, when the questions started to get a bit more interesting—
 

 
“As of today, Tong Zhao, your performances in ‘Ming Emperor,’ ‘72 Hours,’ and ‘Sea King Kill’ have shown a lot of variation in your subconscious. There has been much speculation from the outside; how do you think you accomplished this? Is it really due to having triplets?” The reporter ended with a joke.
 

 
The audience watching the interview livestream perked up.
 

 
Great question!
 

 
This was the issue they were most concerned about!
 

 
“First of all, I can assure you that I am an only child,”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed, showing her calm and cheerful side as always in front of the camera. “I’ve gone through many changes during my growth process, and I’ve had very different thoughts at different stages. The differences are so stark that they seem like they wouldn’t appear in the same person. Before entering the holographic chamber, I would immerse myself in the mindset of that period, which is why it looks so special. Of course, they are all me.”
 

 
As she finished, her slightly curved eyes sparkled with gentle smiles.
 

 
Tong Zhao loves herself too much.
 

 
[Beauty fans are fully satisfied!]
 

 
[Ahhh, my wife is smiling at me! Where’s the best place to buy a house in the school district?]
 

 
[Whether she’s the cold and aloof fairy or the private Tong Zhao, I want them all!]
 

 
Tong Zhao, professionally exuding her glamorous aura, had an extremely strong presence, but her usual demeanor was a bit more reserved than concubine Chen’s and not as sharp and cold as Lu Xianchang’s. Overall, she was more warm and worldly, making her more acceptable to mainstream audiences.
 

 
The reporter, subconsciously influenced by her aura, ended up focusing more on her despite the intention to share the spotlight evenly.
 

 
Ding Jiao’s fans were about to complain about the bias when they noticed how their younger sister looked at Tong Zhao…
 

 
The orange forces were in trouble!
 

 
“Director Shi has a habit of making things difficult for actors. I’ve heard that Tong Zhao is the director’s favorite instinctive actor? Did anything interesting happen during your collaboration?”
 

 
“Make things difficult for actors?” Shi Qianqiu asked, puzzled, turning to look at the other crew members. “Did I? I don’t think so. But Tong Zhao is indeed my favorite actor; her subconscious is very creative—she’s the most unique one I’ve ever seen.”
 

 
“We won’t compare with the tweezers and bullet clips!”
 

 
This cross-regional interaction not only had netizens laughing out loud but also sparked interest in the film.
 

 
The news about “Heartless Tribulation” causing many female actors to return home empty-handed was a long time ago. With He Duoduo mentioning it here and marketing accounts reposting it, netizens began to reminisce—miraculously, there was no situation of disparaging each other; instead, they could only exclaim that Tong Zhao’s subconscious was too powerful and feminine.
 

 
[If you want to compete with Tong Zhao, you have to go to the male actor circle.]
 

 
[The hard male actors in domestic entertainment all have uncle vibes; why not go to foreign entertainment to compete?]
 

 
[Support my sister in breaking out of Asia and bringing glory to the country! /doge /doge]
 

 
These joking comments shifted netizens’ and fans’ attention to just how powerful Tong Zhao really was.
 

 
After one content creator compiled all of Tong Zhao’s action scenes, the view count skyrocketed, landing it in the top three of the film and television section on Bilibili. After watching, netizens couldn’t help but fall into deep contemplation.
 

 
Is this the same person who danced the jumping jingling dance, single-handedly battled an army of zombies, and after severing her left hand, still managed to take down the scumbag?
 

 
Is it really the same person?
 

 
The edited video, along with Tong Zhao’s interview after the premiere of “Heartless Tribulation,” explained this phenomenon.
 

 
Netizens started to wonder what major changes Tong Zhao had experienced in her life.
 

 
Since she rarely talked about her past experiences, they began to fill in the gaps with grandiose imaginings based on her distinctive subconscious—
 

 
The imperial concubine always gets what she wants.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have had a rich romantic history; she’s an old sea king.
 

 
Feng Yanqi is decisive and incredibly cool.
 

 
Tong Zhao must have great leadership skills; she was probably the boss back in school.
 

 
Mu Yingchen has an ethereal quality, completely detached from the mortal world.
 

 
Perhaps one day Tong Zhao will hold a press conference to announce that she’s going to inherit her family’s Taoist temple.
 

 
As the speculation became increasingly absurd, netizens envisioned Tong Zhao as having had a tumultuous and extraordinary first half of her life.
 

 
[Ah, I really want to be childhood friends with Sister Zhao; her life must be amazing!]
 

 
...
 

 
Xu Zhu, who grew up with Tong Zhao, felt very confused.
 

 
Wasn’t she just an ordinary rich girl?
 

 
Romantic experiences? She hasn’t even dated!
 

 
Leadership skills? Tong Zhao doesn’t even participate in clubs!
 

 
Xu Zhu also knew very well that the Tong family didn’t have a Taoist temple to inherit.
 

 
What a tumultuous first half of life!
 

 
However, with the immense popularity of “Heartless Tribulation,” netizens’ curiosity continued to grow. The discussion remained heated, and they finally managed to uncover some clues about her background through Tong Zhao’s old classmates…
# Chapter60
No wall cannot be broken through in this world.
 

 
If there is, it must be because the previous hammering wasn't forceful enough.
 

 
And this time, "Heartless Tribulation" is so hot that the curiosity of netizens about its sole protagonist, Tong Zhao, is like a giant iron hammer, constantly pounding away with "Eighty!" "Eighty!" until it finally breaks through the wall.
 

 
Just how popular is "Heartless Tribulation"?
 

 
On its opening day, it raked in 183 million yuan, contributing nearly ninety percent of the total box office for that day. Other films released around the same time were pitifully compared to it, and the entire industry knew that Shi Qianqiu was about to produce another phenomenal work.
 

 
It's infuriating how people can make you feel inadequate!
 

 
New directors fear nothing more than investors losing faith in them.
 

 
Shi, coming from a wealthy background, had plenty of opportunities to try and fail, and his innate talent helped him soar once he got going.
 

 
So while his peers were envious of him, they wouldn’t lose their composure; they could only sigh at how lucky he was.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" took years to finally start filming, and it truly allowed him to meet Tong Zhao, who delivered an unparalleled and outstanding performance, creating an unforgettable Mu Yingchen for the audience. It’s hard to say whether it was his keen eye for talent or just pure luck. With the year-end Best Instinct Film Awards approaching, nominations were guaranteed, and one could anticipate wins for Best Modeling and Best Actress—just thinking about it made one envious.
 

 
As for the Best Modeling Award…
 

 
There’s no helping it; the budget is what it is.
 

 
The modeling rental fees for many grand scenes in "Heartless Tribulation" weren’t cheap, let alone original constructions—all the funding was going up in flames.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was particularly generous with his spending.
 

 
Meanwhile, films with similar themes have seen a slight uptick in box office earnings due to its influence—
 

 
Although most new reviews criticize them for being far inferior to "Heartless Tribulation," it's still enjoyable to eat alongside the big brother.
 

 
Making money isn’t embarrassing.

"Recent Major Film's Female Lead Background Revealed"
 

 
“Wait, are the two actresses in 'Countdown 72 Hours' actually good friends? They don’t look like it!”
 

 
“TZ and XZ have been good friends from middle school to high school, and there are solid photos to prove it.”
 

 
…
 

 
Among the trending topics on Weibo is a high school photo of Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu.
 

 
In the photo, the two girls are not wearing any makeup and have innocent looks on their faces.
 

 
Even without makeup, it’s clear that the girl on the right with flowing long hair is Tong Zhao. She has prominent features; her three-dimensional facial structure has already blossomed into a beauty that could withstand the test of the big screen. Her bright, curved eyes and radiant smile make her look carefree.
 

 
In comparison, Xu Zhu, standing to her left, appears somewhat indistinct.
 

 
The backdrop of the photo features a well-manicured lawn, and the source claims this is a corner of an expensive private school.
 

 
Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao are both female, so even if they were old acquaintances, it wouldn't be big news.
 

 
The issue arises from their past collaboration.
 

 
During the filming of “Countdown 72 Hours,” the relationship they portrayed on and off-screen was very cold, with zero interaction during promotional events. In the movie, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, also treats her older sister Feng Yanqi poorly.
 

 
However, the newly revealed photo shows the two holding hands, looking like a pair of good friends.
 

 
The informant also stated that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu were inseparable good sisters.
 

 
They even took the same private car to and from school.
 

 
Tong Zhao is from a wealthy family, but there’s no information about Xu Zhu’s family; she hasn’t mentioned it.
 

 
With the photo as proof, the credibility of this anonymous tip has greatly increased. Riding on the film's success and Tong Zhao’s own popularity, discussions among netizens began to surge.
 

 
Excited fans of Xu Zhu jumped in:
 

 
[Little sister is indeed a princess raised with love.]
 

 
[Wow, this school is obviously expensive; she’s definitely a child who can go home to inherit the family business if she doesn’t work hard on her dancing.]
 

 
[The beautiful sister's friend is a fairy sister; I'm in awe.]
 

 
Compared to the excitement of Xu Zhu's fans, Tong Zhao's fans focused more on seeing old photos of their idol.
 

 
[The only good thing about this photo leak is that it proves Tong Zhao's natural beauty; she hasn't had any plastic surgery.]
 

 
[Friendships from school days don’t mean much; let’s just wait patiently for Sister Zhao to speak up.]
 

 
Since Xu Zhu debuted in “Star Selection Girls,” she hasn’t made much of a splash aside from a poorly received apocalyptic film. Under Tong Zhenming's connections, she managed to land the leading role in a drama, but unfortunately, it received a lukewarm response after airing. In contrast, whatever Tong Zhao stars in becomes a hit, and “Heartless Tribulation” catapulted her, albeit temporarily, to the status of box office goddess; she just needs one more movie to maintain her position.
 

 
In terms of status, popularity, and the allure of subconscious charm, the two are not on the same level.
 

 
Unless the main person initiates interaction, Tong Zhao’s fans would definitely not like to see their idol being overshadowed by a talent show contestant trying to ride the wave of popularity.
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans, on the other hand, saw it differently.
 

 
They believed that as long as they remained polite, it would definitely be a positive interaction since their sister wouldn’t lose anything.
 

 
Meanwhile, those who truly understood the relationship between the two, particularly in the second-generation circle, especially the WeChat group of Zeshan Company—
 

 
Second Generation C: [Weibo Link]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Ah, this]
 

 
Second Generation B: [Ah, this 1]
 

 
Second Generation D: [Where's Tong Zhao? Quickly @ Tong Zhao, we can't let this white lotus ride the wave of popularity!]
 

 
Since Tong Zhao hadn’t shown up, they were muttering among themselves, waiting to understand her stance before publicly expressing their support. Clearly, the old man from the Tong family was in the wrong; this was not handled properly. They were professional rich kids, often getting into trouble and having one or two cards cut off by their families, relying only on their five-figure “meager” allowances and friends to survive until their elders cooled down.
 

 
That was called getting lectured by their parents.
 

 
But what about Tong Zhao’s family?
 

 
It was clearly bullying their sister Zhao to death, wanting to elevate the mistress's pair of children.
 

 
Just after finishing a grueling body practice and covered in sweat, Tong Zhao walked out of the bathroom and received a call from her agent: “You and Xu Zhu are good sisters? Why didn't you tell me?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
That term “good sisters” was a shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a big sip of mineral water: “Good thing I hadn’t eaten; otherwise, I’d be sick.”
 

 
“What’s going on?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't like to talk about her family matters. It was impossible for her to voluntarily share her sob story; knowing her current self was enough, and there was no need to be overly curious about her past. However, since Sister Chu asked, there had to be a reason behind it, so she briefly explained her background as concisely as possible: “She’s my half-sister.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “!!!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Xu Zhu's mom used to be my mom’s subordinate and close friend. My mom considered her a true friend. During her pregnancy, she secretly climbed into my dad’s bed and ended up pregnant with Xu Zhu. So, we’re very close in age, essentially blooming from both ends. My mom thought she was tricked by a scumbag and got pregnant out of wedlock, so she took care of her in various ways and even later moved in with us.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “???"
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Later, my mom passed away. The mistress successfully gave birth to a son and fulfilled my dad’s dream of continuing the family line. After she moved in, I had a fight with him and severed our father-daughter relationship, then moved out. The subsequent events fast-forwarded to me acting in 'The Legend of Ming Emperor.'”
 

 
The amount of information was overwhelming, and Sister Chu felt a bit dizzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao's tone was so calm, as if she were talking about someone else.
 

 
But upon reflection, it was indeed a tumultuous tale of love and hate that shattered one's worldview.
 

 
“Then why did you take on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’…”
 

 
It must have been difficult to perform alongside her enemy's daughter. Sister Chu felt a sympathetic affection for the girl.
 

 
However, the sympathy lasted no more than three seconds before the young girl countered, “What’s there to not take on? At that time, it was a great resource for me, and besides, it should be her who can’t face me; I have nothing to hide from her.”
 

 
She had thought it through too clearly.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu has always wanted to compete with her.
 

 
Competing for the title of “daughter of Tong Zhenming,” competing for the image of a “rich beauty,” and competing for the public's affection.
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it and realized this was indeed the case.
 

 
So she summarized what had happened online: “I’m here to clarify your stance; as good as it sounds, the company doesn’t want you to get involved with her. It’s best to distance yourself a bit; otherwise, you’ll lose your prestige.”
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and opened her WeChat page, where she saw messages of concern from her friends.
 

 
Wei Zekai exploded in the group chat.
 

 
Boss Kai: [I want to confront her! @Tong Zhao]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, come out, I can’t hold it in anymore, I really want to curse that girl]
 

 
Boss Kai: [@Tong Zhao, we have group photos too, can I post two?]
 

 
Wei Zekai was so angry.
 

 
His relationship with Tong Zhao was so solid.
 

 
Then he woke up to see that, well, Xu Zhu had become Tong Zhao’s best friend.
 

 
This was more than just the house collapsing; it was like being robbed!
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. Did he not understand the situation? He was even jealous of Xu Zhu: [Go ahead and post.]
 

 
She thought for a moment: [Let them curse; I’m not planning to give her any face.]
 

 
After telling her friends, she expressed to Sister Chu: “I don’t want everyone to pay too much attention to my private affairs. Xu Zhu shouldn’t want to stir up sisterhood for attention either; she’s more anxious than I am, afraid I’ll expose her dirty laundry.”
 

 
Sister Chu thought about it too.
 

 
Xu Zhu had created an image of a rich and beautiful princess for herself. If her fans found out her mom was a mistress, her persona would collapse, and her fans would scatter: “But dealing with this kind of rich family matter... it’s not very appropriate for either the company or you to bring it up; it feels a bit low-class.”
 

 
“No,”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked slightly: “I’ll just go along with it; someone wants to vent for me.”
 

 
“Who?” After asking, Sister Chu recalled a name: “Wei Zekai? Or Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
“Not just Wei Zekai, but some other friends too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao casually mentioned a list of flashy second-generation names that exuded a "smell of copper": "Why bring up Director Shi? I'm not familiar with him. Don’t be fooled by him praising me everywhere; in private, he doesn't even like my posts in our social circles. It's the purest colleague relationship."
 

 
"As long as it's not him, but you still have your CP super topic with Director Shi," her manager teased her. "With that tone you just used, I thought Xu Zhu was going to cut off a couple of her arms."
 

 
...
 

 
Time was precious, and they stopped chatting about personal matters. Sister Chu hung up the phone to align the company's public relations stance, while Tong Zhao dried her hair, played with her phone, and scrolled through Weibo and WeChat to observe the situation.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Zhu was also feeling anxious.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously blacklisted her, and she had cut ties with any mutual friends who kept in touch with Xu Zhu; it was quite definitive. Xu Zhu really didn't dare to rely on her fame; it was just that once someone becomes famous, their past is bound to be dug up, catching her off guard.
 

 
Xu Zhu had a lot she wanted to say to Tong Zhao.
 

 
— You’re in a rising phase now; exposing this kind of information, even if you’re the victim, will affect your image.
 

 
— Is it really good to drag family into this? Your mother just passed away not long ago; if this gets out, many people will definitely talk about her.
 

 
— Tong Zhao, your movie has been successful again. You've already achieved everything; can we just pretend we never knew each other?
 

 
It was useless; Tong Zhao simply didn’t answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.
 

 
Xu Zhu now just wanted to find out who leaked the information and give them a good beating.
 

 
Xu Zhu opened Weibo.
 

 
So far, no one had mentioned her background. She had a strong sense of pride; her old classmates didn’t know what her family did, and since they saw her lifestyle was high-end, they thought she was from the same social class. Weibo was calm, with Tong Zhao's fans not particularly liking her, but they hadn’t escalated the situation, as if it were the calm before a storm.
 

 
She clicked on the group photo.
 

 
After a moment of thought, Xu Zhu remembered what they had been doing back then.
 

 
Right, at that time, Tong Zhao had been taking tennis lessons with her, and afterward, they asked a passing classmate to help them take a hand-holding photo on the lawn... Tong Zhao looked better than her, so she didn’t particularly like to be in the same frame with her, but on that day, perhaps because the weather was too nice, the dopamine released from intense exercise influenced her, making her inexplicably want a photo together.
 

 
In the picture, the two of them really looked like they were very close.
 

 
Xu Zhu irritably put down her phone.
 

 
The gossip about "good sisters" wasn’t that interesting; just as netizens were about to lose interest, a major influencer suddenly compiled a collection of posts by the second-generation rich, with Wei Zekai leading the way—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [@Star Selection Girl Xu Zhu, stay away from my brother.]
 

 
Second-Gen A: [Ordinary good sisters share food, jewelry, and daily life, but sister Zhu’s good sisters share about her dad.]
 

 
Second-Gen B: [sister Zhu really knows how to play the role of the rich beauty; her mother can charm a man into kicking his eldest daughter out and cutting off her financial support. The mistress who climbs to the top is forever a goddess!]
 

 
Second-Gen C: [The three-year period is up; as for the Tong family, it’s fine to let them go! Let us at Zeshan Company welcome Boss Zhao back to her rightful place—]
 

 
The rich second-generation crowd didn't engage in the entertainment industry's superficial politeness; they were sarcastic and even tagged people directly, not afraid of escalating the situation, which kept netizens’ minds busy as they realized it had turned into a wealthy family feud!
 

 
Xu Zhu's fans were confused.
 

 
What did it mean for a mistress to rise to power and for a bird to take over another’s nest?
 

 
Some younger fans were upset and questioned them in the comments, but the second-generation crowd didn’t care; the more they fought back, the more dirt came to light.
 

 
Since much of the information emerged from nested comments, it was somewhat disorganized. By the end of the afternoon, a representative had compiled a timeline that clarified the relationship between Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao, even uncovering the company and connections behind the Tong family—
 

 
Goodness, they were actually one of the main investors in "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
Many viewers who followed this season’s talent show were fans of other contestants and had their own suspicions about who seemed pre-determined to debut; Xu Zhu was one of those "chosen ones," but her singing and dancing skills were merely acceptable and hadn't been scrutinized deeply.
 

 
Once this was uncovered...
 

 
The dirt had been dug up, causing some upper-ranking contestants who didn’t qualify for debut to feel indignant.
 

 
If this information had been revealed earlier, it might have opened up a spot for their younger sister.
 

 
Unfortunately, there were no "what ifs" in this world.
 

 
The only way to vent their frustration was to lash out at Xu Zhu.
 

 
The audience of "Star Selection Girl" began to recount the details Xu Zhu had previously crafted for her "rich princess" persona, realizing it had all been a façade.
 

 
Some fans didn’t believe it.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu seemed very at ease and natural when using expensive skincare products and designer handbags; she didn’t seem like a nouveau riche.
 

 
A rich second-generation individual responded to this argument from fans: [Of course she seems natural because Tong Zhao's mother treated her like the daughter of a good friend, buying double of everything so they could use it together. She’s gotten used to leeching off that, sucking blood like a vampire, and she continues to do so.]
 

 
[Hahaha, you can tell they’re a seasoned player with that comment.]
 

 
[Uh, actually, Tong Zhao’s mom seems a bit foolish, right? Didn’t she notice the signs? It’s quite remarkable that a dumpling could raise someone like Tong Zhao with such subconscious traits.]
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao had never brought this up on her own, as she didn’t want people discussing her mother.
 

 
In her dark, single apartment, she curled up on the soft couch, with only the light from her phone illuminating the space.
 

 
Her WeChat group was discussing her situation.
 

 
Whenever she wanted, she could join the discussion and accept her friends' comfort.
 

 
They all felt indignant on her behalf and were heartbroken for her… Compared to her past life, she truly had so much more in this one.
 

 
After watching for a while, she still chose to speak to the persona in her mind: [My mom is indeed a bit foolish.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [She doesn’t have an eye for people.]
 

 
Han Zhi: 【But that doesn’t justify her friend’s husband betraying her.】
 

 
They all shared Tong Zhao’s perspective and saw some of the “self-inflicted” comments.
 

 
This victim-blaming theory was just a small portion of the voices.
 

 
[I was also quite foolish back then,]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was restrained and detached, as if she were talking about someone else, but it gradually lowered: [I won’t be foolish anymore. I won’t be foolish again.]
 

 
Tong Zhao saw a netizen saying that her mother's foolishness harmed her and chuckled lightly: [According to the logic of “mother’s debt is repaid by the daughter,” I won’t let go of anyone who has hurt her. She is responsible for being foolish and falling for tricks; I am responsible for slapping faces and taking revenge. Sounds good.]
 

 
…
 

 
As the once-dirty secrets were laid bare in the sunlight, the beautifully packaged little princess revealed her true form.
 

 
Countless netizens and disappointed fans bombarded the phone lines of the entertainment company that Xu Zhu was signed to. She had truly become "famous," but it was a kind of fame akin to being burned by fire. The company tried to contact Tong Zhao's manager, but all they said was that the artist clearly refused to communicate. Xu Zhu also stated that everything they said was true.
 

 
With deep-seated grievances, how could there be any communication?
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
Everything is true.
 

 
With these four words posted, all possibilities for private negotiation from Xu Zhu's side were completely blocked.
 

 
The situation Xu Zhu faced was even more serious than that of Chen Zhuzhi.
 

 
Chen Zhuzhi had a solid foundation and works, and when domestic violence erupted, it drove away a large number of fans while awakening a batch of confused minds. Xu Zhu, on the other hand, was a shallow-rooted contestant; if it weren’t for her wealthy background and connections, she would have been just a quickly-fading commodity from the moment she debuted. Now, with her carefully crafted persona collapsing, all the air she had been holding onto was gone.
 

 
That day, Xu Zhu returned home from the dormitory, unable to face the questions of the other members of "Star Selection Girl."
 

 
But that place couldn’t even be considered her home.
 

 
When the incident made headlines in entertainment news, Tong Zhenming returned, enraged after being met with strange looks from the company’s shareholders. He forbade her from dreaming of being a star again: “If you still want to acknowledge me as your father, then stay out of the spotlight and behave yourself at home! After wasting so much time and acting like a demon for so long, you should know that you’re not cut out for this.”
 

 
Xu Zhu lowered her head and remained silent.
 

 
Her silence was a sign of her unwillingness to admit guilt; Tong Zhenming wanted her to apologize.
 

 
“...I know I was wrong; I’m sorry.”
 

 
Xu Zhu's eyes turned red.
 

 
Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let her leave, pressing down on her shoulder: “What did you do wrong?”
 

 
In that moment, immense grievance exploded from Xu Zhu’s chest. She looked up and glared at her biological father with hatred: “I was wrong for competing with Tong Zhao. I can’t compete with her for what I want, and everything I’ve fought for is worthless!”
 

 
She shrank her shoulders, rushed back to her room, and slammed the door shut, ignoring her father’s attempts to pound on it.
 

 
The Tong family was still wealthy, and the door was solidly built.
 

 
Just when things were going wrong, Xu Zhu felt even more humiliated. Ning Zhiyi suggested they take a break from each other to cool off.
 

 
She felt numb.
 

 
The dream of becoming a star that she wanted to snatch away from Tong Zhao was never hers to take.
 

 
The two men she had managed to win over didn’t love her; they loved themselves and their interests.
 

 
Xu Zhu buried her face in the pillow and cried for a while. Once she calmed down, she gradually accepted the reality that she had to give up her dream of stardom. If she couldn’t surpass her stepsister, she might as well return to being a wealthy young lady. Netizens wouldn’t be able to do anything to her.
 

 
Maybe later she could apologize to Tong Zhenming in a soft tone, she thought.
 

 
At least she would still be a young lady, able to live the affluent life she had always wanted, the life a Tong family heiress should have.
 

 
Even though “Heartless Tribulation” had become a hit, the actors didn’t receive a share of the investment profits; Tong Zhao would only get her original salary, which was definitely less than making a business profit. Thinking of this, Xu Zhu felt a slight rise in her fondness for her father.
 

 
This man held grudges, couldn’t stand being defied by juniors, and it seemed that this time, she would have to kneel and admit her mistakes to return to being his “good daughter”…
 

 
However, Tong Zhenming wasn’t angry about her behavior this time.
 

 
He had a more urgent matter to deal with—
 

 
Three companies that had been collaborating with them suddenly announced they wouldn’t work with the Tong family anymore.
 

 
A product that brought in steady profits for the Tong family faced competition, significantly affecting cash flow. The management could no longer hide the situation after seeing the reports and had to report it upward.
 

 
Wasn’t everything going well?
 

 
Forget it; if it doesn’t work, they’ll just have to change partners. China is so big; finding clients isn’t that hard, right?
 

 
Tong Zhenming was shocked to realize that this was a premeditated and organized attack from several companies with strong momentum. Some were new companies, while others, previously struggling, suddenly had best-selling new products or incredibly profitable projects…
 

 
As for other local companies, as soon as they heard it was the Tong family, they were unwilling to wade into such muddy waters.
 

 
Tong Zhenming sent gifts and treated people to meals, only then learning about half of the truth behind the scenes.
 

 
The Wei family had only one young master, Wei Zekai.
 

 
No matter how useless he might be, everything would eventually be left to him.
 

 
Wei Zekai had posted ten Weibo messages cursing the illegitimate daughter and Tong Zhenming. Even if the Wei family hadn’t said anything, everyone tacitly acknowledged that the two families had fallen out.
 

 
Why would anyone risk offending the Wei family to help Tong Zhenming get through this crisis?
 

 
They weren’t foolish.
 

 
Unless there was a higher profit to be gained!
 

 
Given the high margins involved, it wouldn’t be impossible to cooperate.
 

 
The result was that if Tong Zhenming wanted to endure this situation, he would have to give up the vast majority of the profits.
 

 
“A bunch of capitalists sucking the marrow out of bones!”
 

 
He cursed bitterly, inadvertently including himself in the insult.
 

 
Tong Zhenming blamed everything on Wei Zekai, overlooking the other half of the truth.
 

 
During the same period, the second-generation wealthy individuals who voiced support for Tong Zhao on Weibo faced reprimands at home due to their low status. Their elders felt it was embarrassing for them to be in the news for cursing online, and they quickly cut off their financial support, wanting them to reflect on their actions and not offend people recklessly. They weren’t all from families as stable and prestigious as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
However, this time, the economic sanctions were ineffective.
 

 
Because those who had latched onto Tong Zhao, listened to her, and stirred up investment projects, the Ze Shan venture capital they had whimsically formed…
 

 
Actually made money.
 

 
Not only did they make money, but they also received dividends on the spot!
 

 
The second-generation individuals, driven purely by passion to support Tong Zhao, stared at the long string of zeros in their balances, alongside messages from their siblings on WeChat saying, “That so-called friend of yours? Now that she has no support from home, she’s just another girl hustling in the entertainment industry. Don’t let yourself be used without realizing it. Dad has frozen your card. You can borrow from other second-generations, but can you borrow from that female celebrity?”…
 

 
They truly didn’t know how to respond.
 

 
At the same time, in the Ze Shan venture capital shareholders' WeChat group.
 

 
Second Generation A: [Wait, weren’t we losing money together while doing charity?]
 

 
Second Generation C: [How could any project that my brother Kai invests in actually make money!?]
 

 
Boss Kai: [I'll give you all a chance to withdraw and reorganize your statements.]
 

 
When people are in extreme shock, they often speak their true feelings.
 

 
Among them, some had personally supervised the investment projects and had seen them improving, but Brother Kai's reputation for losing money was too strong. They were internally at ease, waiting for the day the project would collapse, never expecting to make a profit.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [As long as I'm here, we won't lose money.]
# Chapter61
After Ze Shan group was established, Tong Zhao invested in several projects that she believed would become popular.
 

 
Of course, her investments weren't made blindly.
 

 
What if the movies she produced unintentionally set off a butterfly effect?
 

 
To earn money in the long run, it's crucial to understand the underlying meaning behind investments. Many people lose money in stocks simply by following tips about stocks that are supposedly guaranteed to be profitable, only to jump in without understanding. They wait too long to sell, thinking they might make more, and end up losing it all.
 

 
Tong Zhao used her foresight to eagerly absorb various knowledge, filtering out reliable and sustainable projects that could be managed by Wei Zekai and his team. She was too busy with announcements to do anything other than make decisions, so she often delegated tasks.
 

 
She didn’t put all her eggs in one basket.
 

 
Even if a stock in her memory was set to soar, she only invested a portion.
 

 
The money she missed out on was part of her risk assessment; it didn’t count as a loss.
 

 
Second Generation A: "If I had known that 721 would skyrocket, I would have borrowed heavily to invest!"
 

 
Second Generation D: "I borrowed from the loan sharks!"
 

 
Boss Kai: "@Second Generation D, are you suggesting we give the loan sharks a run for their money?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Don’t treat missed profits as losses; focus on what you have."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll be responsible for figuring out how to expand our portfolio.”
 

 
Wei Zekai shared his grand ambitions in the group, and Tong Zhao casually chimed in, which had a greater impact on the members than even their own parents' advice.
 

 
It wasn’t solely about the money.
 

 
One major reason was the offline gathering where they decided to establish Ze Shan group. Tong Zhao had momentarily tapped into the spirit of a rally for a survival organization in a dystopian setting—she could have easily been a successful network marketer, inspiring these sheltered young heirs to work fervently for her.
 

 
Additionally, this was their first successful venture that yielded significant returns.
 

 
Their families had always doubted their intelligence, talent, and dedication, believing they weren't cut out for business. This group of second-generation heirs lacked nothing in terms of basic needs and always aimed for the best.
 

 
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, their pursuits revolved around socializing, respect, and self-actualization.
 

 
Tong Zhao managed to satisfy all three desires at once, making them willingly follow her.
 

 
While their earlier involvement had a playful aspect, the first round of profits genuinely astonished them. They collectively invested five million (mostly from Wei’s allowance, which he later topped up), and they had already recouped their investment. The total valuation of the projects they invested in reached eight figures… this part couldn’t be liquidated yet, but it was sustainable unless the companies bought back their shares at a high price.
 

 
Even if they intended to, Tong Zhao wouldn’t sell now.
 

 
She extended a helping hand during the companies' toughest times; she wasn’t there for charity. She planned to hold long-term and consider selling at the right moment to maximize profits.
 

 
The current profits looked impressive but were merely small gains compared to the ongoing potential.
 

 
It was like going back to "Sword Three" to speculate on limited-edition fashion—what seemed exaggerated at hundreds could later reach thousands.
 

 
Boss Kai: "Listen to my brother!”
 

 
Boss Kai: "By the way, bro, about the 'Excellent Companion Learning' project you tasked me with, Boss Chen has added a ton of details based on your instructions. We’re optimistic about this project, but we need more funding for promotion…"
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered.
 

 
The concept of companionship and training had only gained popularity in recent years, and it was still a blue ocean market.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’m very optimistic about this project. Keep investing, and let me know if you need more. It has to be executed well."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…I was just giving some suggestions, how did it turn into orders?"
 

 
At that moment, a colleague who had attended the meeting with Boss Chen jumped in to report—
 

 
Wei Zekai was serious about executing Tong Zhao's directives, turning the unseen strategist into an untouchable investment guru. After hearing about the "ton of details" from Wei, Boss Chen not only was brought back on track but also illuminated many profitable paths that others might not have seen. He had studied for a long time but hadn’t figured it out until now!
 

 
After all, some conclusions can only be reached through trial and error.
 

 
Boss Chen immediately regarded this strategist from Ze Shan as a remarkable figure, akin to Zhuge Liang.
 

 
Considering Wei’s age and background, this strategist must have been sent by the Wei family to safeguard their only son, conjuring an image of a well-dressed elder with well-maintained salt-and-pepper hair.
 

 
The same situation repeatedly occurred when the second-generation heirs went to oversee these companies.
 

 
They feared they weren’t authoritative enough.
 

 
After all, they were just following Sister Zhao’s lead.
 

 
But in the eyes of these smaller companies, they arrived with substantial investments, and every opinion they voiced was seen as highly enlightening… clearly, they were big shots! Young? Carrying documents? That meant their unseen backer was incredibly impressive!
 

 
Under the invisible pressure from strategist Tong Zhao, the finances of these companies dared not engage in any underhanded dealings.
 

 
Because of the profits, they didn’t even think about schemes to defraud investors or run away—
 

 
Why would someone who successfully started a business and is earning steadily want to flee?
 

 
Working for oneself is the true essence of being an employee!
 

 
If one were to delve a little deeper, Ze Shan group seemed almost like a mysterious cult.
 

 
What Tong Zhao said became their belief.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most devoted archbishop, holding the most practical resources.
 

 
The other second-generation heirs acted as bishops, working to develop followers.
 

 
Every company owner who received investment and guidance from Ze Shan became a devoted believer after seeing substantial profits.
 

 
The colleagues pieced together how the strategist was viewed by these smaller companies.
 

 
Whenever Ze Shan was mentioned, a wise, aged silhouette appeared in their minds—
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I suspect there’s a problem here.JPG]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Forget it, I won't manage this for you; just make sure it’s done well.]
 

 
The second-generation heirs all promptly sent acknowledgment emojis, behaving obediently.
 

 
…
 

 
The "Good Sisters" controversy did not cease with Xu Zhu’s announcement of her withdrawal from the entertainment industry.
 

 
At first, audiences of "Star Selection Girl" suspected that Xu Zhu's debut was rigged, uncovering her connections and the Tong family. Tong Zhenming’s company was suddenly thrust into the public eye, and angry fans created a PR crisis for the company—friends who had helped arrange Xu Zhu’s debut no longer wanted to associate with him.
 

 
Netizens began to focus on what kind of life Tong Zhao had at home.
 

 
Dramatically, fans of "Heartless Tribulation" discovered the film's submitted documents.
 

 
Such documents are available for public scrutiny through the film association, completely transparent, but generally, only dedicated fans pay attention. The documents clearly stated whether lead actress Tong Zhao had applied for pain exemption.
 

 
…
 

 
"Shocking My Whole Family: Tong Zhao didn't apply for pain exemption in 'Heartless Tribulation'???"
 

 
The main post immediately garnered significant attention.
 

 
Similar screenshots circulated widely on Weibo.
 

 
Some netizens questioned why she would put herself through this, given that the memories recovered from the holographic chamber could be painfully distressing, potentially leaving psychological scars.
 

 
However, the top comment from a fan offered a different perspective: [Applying for pain exemption mainly serves to give the protagonist an advantage; after all, the subconscious has a natural tendency to seek benefit and avoid harm. Not having pain exemption could enhance the actor's performance, though it might affect realism.]
 

 
Even without pain exemption, Tong Zhao's subconscious was just as ruthless with herself.
 

 
A young fan advised Tong Zhao and her manager on Weibo to arrange for a psychologist for their sister, fearing she might have self-destructive tendencies.
 

 
Seeing this, Tong Zhao felt compelled to respond.
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV:
 

 
"My mental state is very healthy.
 

 
I'm used to pain and prefer not to apply for exemption, as it could affect my subconscious performance."
 

 
Tong Zhao managed her Weibo personally.
 

 
She felt it was impossible to make any inappropriate comments that could lead to her being blacklisted. She didn't want her fans to only see a Weibo filled with promotional ads and business selfies... While she couldn’t respond to everyone’s affection, she at least wanted the few ways fans could "connect" with her to feel more genuine.
 

 
Other than that, she had nothing more to say.
 

 
Public curiosity would never be satisfied.
 

 
To respond to everything was impractical—first, there was no time, and second, it would lower her status.
 

 
“I’ll just be myself; let them think what they want about the rest,” she told her manager.
 

 
“So confident,” Sister Chu said, giving her a thumbs-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, steering the conversation back to work: “Isn’t the next variety show about survival on a deserted island? Not applying for pain exemption could be used for publicity; if others do it, I won’t.”
 

 
Sister Chu glanced at Tong Zhao’s light-hearted Weibo post.
 

 
She then reflected on Tong Zhao's comment about using it for publicity, which had a very commercial flavor and felt quite grounded. She couldn’t help but feel a bit dazed: “That angle could indeed be expanded, but you’re only a guest for two days; we should first decide what major project to take next…”
 

 
Another director wanted her to audition.
 

 
Of course, given her current status, not everyone could afford her, but several prominent names still required Tong Zhao to be on her toes.
 

 
The conversations between stars and their managers remained unknown to the outside world.
 

 
Fans, on one hand, felt reassured knowing that their sister’s mental health was in good shape.
 

 
On the other hand, netizens focused on Tong Zhao's comment about being "used to pain."
 

 
What situation would lead someone to become accustomed to pain?
 

 
Considering the previously uncovered details about the Tong family, Tong Zhenming clearly didn’t care for his daughter and favored boys over girls.
 

 
Some netizens suggested that "Tong Zhao might have experienced domestic violence," which quickly gained many supporters—if she hadn’t been beaten growing up, how could she be so accustomed to pain?
 

 
To be fair, Tong Zhenming had never physically abused her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao excelled in her studies and was a source of pride for her father among peers. Other than the disappointment of not being a son to carry on the family name, she was already a very perfect daughter.
 

 
But why would Tong Zhao step up to defend him?
 

 
It was impossible; let the netizens speculate.
 

 
Emotional abuse is still abuse.
 

 
The psychological impact and torment inflicted by Tong Zhenming on her were far worse than a physical beating.
 

 
The reputations of Tong Zhenming and Xu Zhu as a dysfunctional father-daughter pair had soured. Xu Zhu had thought that by retreating from the industry, she could live quietly as a pampered young lady, but Tong Zhenming, disregarding her feelings, cut off her allowance, telling her to reflect on herself.
 

 
And this time, it wasn’t just her.
 

 
Xu’s mother, who had recently given birth to a son, also faced a downgrade in lifestyle.
 

 
Conflicts arose between mother and daughter; Xu's mother felt she shouldn’t argue with her father, as the whole family relied on him, while Xu Zhu believed her own mother didn’t see her as a person.
 

 
Without money, life became unbearable. She couldn’t go out shopping to vent and was stuck at home.
 

 
What entertainment was there at home?
 

 
Every time she logged onto Weibo, she was met with insults. Her account had been reclaimed by the company, which only became a platform for netizens and fans to criticize her, almost hoping to dig up a scandal. Fans who once treated her like a little princess were now expressing their disappointment in every word.
 

 
Xu Zhu felt that life had become incredibly difficult.
 

 
If she knew the truth behind this downgrade in lifestyle, it would be even more unbearable.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was no longer generous to his wife and daughter, not for their education, but because he genuinely had little liquidity left. He was already overwhelmed with work, scrambling for connections for the company, and now that people knew it was him, their attitudes shifted subtly.
 

 
Some old-school businessmen didn’t see it as a problem to be harsh with their children.
 

 
The issue was that Tong Zhao and Xu Zhu, in terms of both appearance and achievement, were worlds apart.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's silence in the face of this slander was like stamping “fool” on his forehead.
 

 
A boss who discarded something precious for a trivial gain couldn’t possibly have good investment instincts.
 

 
Considering Tong Zhao's relationship with Wei Zekai, she might even end up being called Mrs. Wei in the future.
 

 
It wasn’t worth it for Tong Zhenming, marked as a fool, to offend the Wei family.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai repeatedly declared that Tong Zhao was his good brother, who could say for sure?
 

 
Moreover—
 

 
After Ze Shan group turned a profit, Wei Zekai returned home triumphantly, turning the family dinner into his performance review. As he talked enthusiastically, clearly and understandably, Wei’s father realized that he had made money, and quite a bit at that.
 

 
Here, “quite a bit” referred not to the amount but to the return on investment.
 

 
Once he finished, Wei’s father surprisingly praised him: “Well done! If you earn five more times, you can make up for your past losses.”
 

 
“……”
 

 
Damn.
 

 
The family didn't want to constrain the child and initially provided him with sufficient funds.
 

 
The losses were quite spectacular.
 

 
Wei Zekai pouted for a moment but quickly rallied, saying, "Don't worry, breaking even is just a small goal for now; in the future, I will lead Ze Shan to grow big and strong."
 

 
As he said this, he raised the corners of his mouth, his handsome face full of youthful vigor.
 

 
Seeing him take a big step from zero to one, the elders didn’t discourage him.
 

 
After dinner, Wei Father called him into the study.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit anxious; after all, he had often been scolded in the study. Every time there was a loss in investment, he would be lectured for two or three hours, and his father would end with, "Maybe you should just find a job."
 

 
Actually, Wei Father was hoping he would work at the family group.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai, having read too many web novels, panicked and thought his father wanted him to work on an assembly line at an electronics factory.
 

 
That time was a low point in his life.
 

 
Now, stepping into the study, he secretly encouraged himself—
 

 
He was making money.
 

 
He needed to be confident!
 

 
"Sit."
 

 
As soon as he walked in, Wei Father patted the sofa, motioning for him to sit down.
 

 
Once he obediently settled, his father got straight to the point: "How much of this was taught to you by someone else?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wei Father had navigated the business world for many years, and with only one son to watch over, it was easy to read Wei Zekai like an open book. When it came to feelings, though he claimed to see Tong Zhao as just a good brother, Wei Father could tell it was far from the truth.
 

 
But why remind his son?
 

 
After all, he had faced his own setbacks in love, and his son shouldn't be spared.
 

 
"About seventy percent," Wei Zekai admitted, realizing he couldn't hide it from his father. "The 'Little Lamb Playmate' project and those others were my responsibility. I didn't want to say too much at home; Tong Zhao asked me to organize the information and bring it back to discuss, saying it was to reassure you."
 

 
Tong Zhao.
 

 
Hearing that name again, Wei Father was a bit surprised.
 

 
In his mind, she was a woman so beautiful that it overshadowed other qualities.
 

 
"Then why didn't you mention her earlier?" Wei Father asked, a hint of displeasure in his tone.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew he had invested a lot of money in Ze Shan.
 

 
In terms of funding, he indeed held the major stake.
 

 
However, some of the precise and seasoned decisions mentioned earlier, along with the reporting approach, were definitely not his own ideas.
 

 
While it’s important to polish one’s own brand in business, taking too much credit is also a major taboo.
 

 
"I want to invite Tong Zhao over to play,"
 

 
Wei Zekai was puzzled: "After reviewing the materials and reports I organized, she polished them up and told me to remember my lines, saying not to mention her and just act like these ideas were all mine."
 

 
Wei Father understood; she was trying to make a good impression on him.
 

 
But since Xiao Kai was an only child, he had no motivation to compete with siblings...
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao's image in Wei Father's mind shifted from a particularly shrewd and beautiful woman to a girl who really liked his son. "You should treat her well, you fool."
 

 
He patted his son’s head.
 

 
After that lesson, he asked Wei Zekai to share his thoughts and questions about managing the company.
 

 
That night, after tucking himself in, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but message Tong Zhao on WeChat: [My dad thinks you’re really good to me.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Did Uncle find out? Well, it’s hard to keep anything from him.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I treat you well because you treat me well.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Moreover, my kindness isn’t blind; I believe you’re qualified to be my partner and have the talent to manage a company... I want to act, I enjoy acting, and I like leaving behind various works that showcase different sides of me. Hearing discussions about the characters I’ve played makes me happy. When my time is limited and I want everything, I can only collaborate with others.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [They are my partners, and you are my collaborator.]
 

 
After sending that, Tong Zhao said it was too late and she was going to bed.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied with an "OK" emoji and didn’t message her again to disturb her.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other that as soon as Tong Zhao sent him a message, he could instantly hear her slightly cold and lazy voice in his mind. So, that lengthy text felt like it came with its own sound effects for him.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a bit restless under the covers, pressing on his chest where his heart was and feeling a little excited.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to make a lot of money, wanted to invest everywhere, and wanted to grow the company strong…
 

 
That was what he wanted too; they shared a common goal.
 

 
Yes, they were partners and lifelong good brothers.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly laughed under the covers.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't dare to go online and scroll through Weibo, because everywhere she looked, there were insults directed at her.
 

 
Originally, a small-time star from a talent show would be virtually ignored online, and after a couple of days of criticism, it would die down.
 

 
The problem was that Tong Zhao, who had recently had a conflict with her, had become incredibly popular.
 

 
She was so famous that her promotional image for "Heartless Tribulation" featured her in a flowing white outfit, holding a long sword. Even those who hadn't seen the movie could recognize her. Her elegant features were hard to reconcile with her softer, delicate persona from "Sea King Kill."
 

 
"Is Tong Zhao's multifaceted subconscious not enough to explain her? Could she possibly have split personality disorder?"
 

 
[Don’t joke about it; there hasn't been a successful example of split personalities portraying different roles in film history.]
 

 
[That's because they aren't all handsome or beautiful / doge/doge.]
 

 
[Instead of wondering why there are so many facets to her subconscious, I'm more concerned about Zhao Zhao's mental health!]
 

 
This was the mainstream view among her fans.
 

 
They believed what Tong Zhao said; after all, each of her personalities had a similar, stubborn core. The essence was still her, just painted in different colors by her tumultuous life experiences...
 

 
“Miss Tong, please have a seat,”
 

 
In a consultation room at the headquarters of the Instinct Film Association, Dr. Gu, a refined gentleman, sat waiting.
 

 
Unlike an ordinary psychological clinic, there was a white holographic imaging chamber in the corner of the room.
 

 
Dr. Gu's gentle eyes, framed by silver-rimmed glasses, looked toward his first special guest of the day. “Would you like something to drink? The examination you’ll undergo will last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, depending on your performance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's unique subconscious had caught the association's attention.
 

 
The Instinct Film Association deals with the subconscious, which differs slightly from the needs of traditional psychologists. Therefore, doctors in this field require an additional license, and top talent is unique to the association. If this emerging actress truly has psychological issues, the association will provide assistance right away, rather than impose sanctions.
 

 
After all, even if she were a patient with schizophrenia, she wouldn't be breaking any laws.
 

 
The production team is willing to work with her, and she still has roles to play.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously declined an examination, but after learning more about the process this time, she didn't want to raise further doubts or cause concern for her genuinely caring friends, so she agreed to find time for it—
 

 
The association has a great reputation in the industry and stands by the actors.
 

 
After she refused the examination last time, some senior colleagues thought she was being cautious and had even comforted and advised her.
 

 
“Once the examination is complete, if everything is fine, can I post the results on Weibo?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
Dr. Gu paused for a moment before smiling. “Miss Tong, are you worried about your fans?”
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
“Of course, Miss Tong, you can think of it as filming a short video for your fans,” Dr. Gu said with a smile. “Actually, I’m one of your fans too.”
 

 
“Great! What do I need to do?”
 

 
Dr. Gu clasped his hands and said gently, “Once you connect to the holographic filming pod, you don’t need to play anyone else; just be yourself.”
 

 
Tong Zhao paused, then jokingly replied with a double entendre, “I haven’t been myself in a long time.”
 

 
“Well, being a big star means you can’t help it.”
 

 
Dr. Gu assumed she meant that stars have to wear a persona when facing the public.
# Chapter62
In the office of the Instinct Film Association.
 

 
"Sorry, I was a bit delayed."
 

 
The association's evaluator walked in and explained the upcoming examination to Tong Zhao: "This is a brand-new medical technology primarily used to understand a patient's psychological state. You can think of it as a CT scan for mental health."
 

 
Tong Zhao understood.
 

 
In medicine, a significant challenge in doctor-patient communication is that the results from consultations are not always accurate. Sometimes, patients may feel too embarrassed to speak up or fall into cognitive traps. For example, when told to fast before a test, a patient might think that drinking a bowl of chicken soup or millet porridge doesn’t count as eating—subjectively not lying, but objectively misleading the doctor.
 

 
Physiological illnesses can be easily identified with a CT scan; tumors cannot be hidden under skin fat. However, psychological ailments have traditionally relied on doctors building trust with patients, who might not even understand themselves.
 

 
With the rise of Instinct Film, the technology has advanced rapidly, propelled by profit, making psychological therapy more accessible.
 

 
"We've both signed confidentiality agreements. Once the examination results are ready, we will provide you with the original recording. If you consent, the association will keep a copy."
 

 
The evaluator made a routine reminder, addressing any concerns: "After all, even if it's just a simulation, many people are reluctant to let others see their inner world."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded to indicate understanding.
 

 
"You’re being too serious," Dr. Gu said with a smile as he turned the tablet to show Tong Zhao three screenshots of rooms. "These are the examination results of three actors who were my clients. They all enjoyed it and even shared their results on Weibo for their fans to see."
 

 
The three rooms included a princess room filled with pink toys, a Scandinavian-style living room, and a library surrounded by bookshelves.
 

 
They all looked quite positive, and Tong Zhao guessed the artists released them after discussing with their companies. Naturally, seeing her inner self align with her expectations made her happy.
 

 
"If..."
 

 
Dr. Gu smiled again, reassuring her: "The confidentiality of the results depends entirely on your personal wishes. Even if the company requests, we won’t disclose anything."
 

 
...
 

 
As Tong Zhao lay down in the white holographic chamber and closed her eyes, a familiar wave of drowsiness washed over her.
 

 
It was worth coming today.
 

 
She thought hazily, also curious about what her subconscious would be like now.
 

 
What was special this time was that, without character background settings or memory inputs, she experienced minimal discomfort, as if she naturally slipped into a gentle dream.
 

 
...
 

 
Once it was confirmed that the guest had entered the holographic scan, the evaluator turned and asked, "What do you think of Tong Zhao's situation?”
 

 
"Tong Zhao's subconscious richness should be greater than that of the average person, which allows her to deliver nuanced performances," Dr. Gu said, filled with admiration.
 

 
He truly was a fan of Tong Zhao, not just for her looks—perhaps due to his profession, he paid special attention to the subconscious traits of instinct film actors. "I suspect her palace of consciousness has more than one room."
 

 
According to past records stored in the association, older actors with richer experiences tend to have larger palaces of consciousness. Even within the same house, the layout and style can vary greatly. There was an established actor who sought help from the association due to psychological issues—
 

 
In a quaint entrance lit by incense, the living room resembled a rundown old house, with dusty windows and a mountain of greasy dishes in the kitchen. Inside the bedroom was a peculiar bed with a cage underneath.
 

 
This type of bed was meant for a certain indescribable group.
 

 
The actor opened the cage door and curled up inside, satisfied.
 

 
The bed was empty except for the trophies he had once earned.
 

 
"You think too highly of Tong Zhao," the evaluator remarked skeptically. "I admit her subconscious expressiveness and resilience are much stronger than current young actors, but she’s still young. It’s likely just one room with a few more things in it."
 

 
Out of professional habit, Dr. Gu didn’t refute him, simply waiting for the monitor to light up.
 

 
It was pitch black.
 

 
"Is it broken? Not connected?"
 

 
Just as the evaluator was about to troubleshoot, the lights came on.
 

 
Contrary to their expectations, Tong Zhao's palace of consciousness appeared quite simple.
 

 
Displayed on the screen was an empty, off-white circular platform, with a single chair in the center.
 

 
It was a very ordinary chair, one that could be bought on Taobao for just 9.99 yuan with free shipping.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the chair, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
"So this is what you call a higher subconscious richness?" The evaluator chuckled, mocking his colleague.
 

 
It seemed rather mundane.
 

 
But the next moment, as she awoke, doors began to emerge from the off-white walls like relief carvings. Each door was spaced about two meters apart, arranged neatly like a poorly managed rental unit, with doors stretching endlessly around Tong Zhao, as if mysterious monsters were about to leap out from behind them, ready to peel her thin frame and devour her.
 

 
The evaluator fell silent.
 

 
Not because he was embarrassed, but because the environment felt unsettling, reminiscent of a horror film.
 

 
Could a psychologically healthy person's palace of consciousness really look like this?
 

 
"Okay, let’s begin the instructions."
 

 
The evaluator operated the scanning chamber, inputting a psychological suggestion for Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I’ve lost something, but I don’t know where it’s hidden in the house."
 

 
This would prompt her to explore her palace of consciousness.
 

 
As the thought formed in her mind, Tong Zhao stood up from the chair and opened the first door…
 

 
A light mist poured out from the door, revealing a resplendent interior of a palace.
 

 
To their astonishment, reclining on an intricately carved bed was a beautiful young girl dressed in vibrant clothes!
 

 
Both of them widened their eyes in shock.
 

 
Typically, there wouldn’t be other living beings in a palace of consciousness. If there were, they would appear in the form of inanimate objects, like poorly made dolls, a vase with a name tag, or a human statue... Instinct films rarely allow for the spontaneous creation of another living person.
 

 
A whole team of modelers could labor tirelessly to create majestic landscapes.
 

 
Even a small stream would leave traces to follow.
 

 
But human thought cannot be constructed in such a way.
 

 
Even the top modeling experts can only create the appearance of a person; they cannot conjure a living human being in the holographic world.
 

 
That’s why a large number of temporary actors are needed.
 

 
"Calm down and think of Han Zhi from 'Sea King Killer,'" Dr. Gu offered an explanation. "Her subconscious is quite unique, which is why she can take on such diverse roles. This girl should be… the favored concubine from 'The Chronicles of Ming Emperor'?"
 

 
...
 

 
"Zhao Zhao,"
 

 
the vibrant girl turned her head, revealing a youthful face that looked about six years younger than the current Tong Zhao, with a delicate flower ornament on her forehead. "Are you here to play with me?"
 

 
In the ancient setting, Tong Zhao had entered the palace at a young age.
 

 
She quickly gained favor, surrounded by young girls, and had enjoyed years of privilege. Eventually, she left as the beloved of the young emperor after completing her mission.
 

 
In her memory, Concubine Chen looked just like this.
 

 
"I’ve lost something. I wanted to see if it might be in your palace."
 

 
"Were you not specifically looking for me?"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Concubine Chen became displeased.
 

 
She waved her hand, her delicate, snow-white arm adorned with gold bangles and silver bells that jingled with her movement. With a sense of entitlement, she ordered Tong Zhao, "Come here and give me a hug."
 

 
Despite still being considered a young girl in modern times, she exuded a vibrant charm.
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed quite accommodating, walking over to embrace her for a moment before stepping back when she felt satisfied.
 

 
She didn't find what she was looking for in this room.
 

 
The next room was a cluttered storage space filled with all sorts of items.
 

 
Dr. Gu focused his attention.
 

 
No, in the corner of the room was a nylon bed, so old and shabby that it blended completely with the background at first glance. Sitting on the nylon bed was a woman in a tank top and shorts, about 28 years old, with a more mature face marked by a scar running from her left cheek to her nose.
 

 
The woman seemed completely unconcerned, playing with a Swiss Army knife.
 

 
The knife flipped skillfully between her fingers.
 

 
The "storage room" contained survival supplies that most people could hardly imagine. If the room's owner lived in peaceful times, they would likely be teased for being overly prepared or a survivalist. The only light source in the room was a dim oil lamp beside the nylon bed, softening her strikingly aggressive beauty.
 

 
Duan Ge smiled when she saw Tong Zhao. "What a rare guest."
 

 
"I'm looking for something," Tong Zhao replied.
 

 
"You’d better hope you never need anything from here," Duan Ge said, concern evident in her gaze. "Are you feeling okay?"
 

 
With that, she stepped down from the nylon bed and embraced Tong Zhao tightly.
 

 
Duan Ge was a head taller than Tong Zhao, her muscular arms clearly defined.
 

 
The powerful hug provided a sense of security.
 

 
While hugging Concubine Chen earlier, Tong Zhao had felt like a big sister, but now, wrapped in Duan Ge's arms, she felt small like a child.
 

 
"Good girl, good girl," Duan Ge cooed.
 

 
Tong Zhao tilted her head back in protest. "I'm not a kid anymore!"
 

 
"In my eyes, you’re still a baby."
 

 
Her protest was futile; not only was she hugged, but Duan Ge also playfully ruffled her hair. Only after Duan Ge felt satisfied did she let her go.
 

 
"Who are these people?" the evaluator asked, puzzled.
 

 
"They might be different phases of Tong Zhao's self-image," Dr. Gu rationalized. "We all had that as kids, right? Imagining ourselves as masked warriors, chosen ones, or magical girls, and then dreaming that we really looked like that."
 

 
The evaluator asked, "What are Diga and masked warriors?”
 

 
Dr. Gu said, "…Forget it."
 

 
Tong Zhao almost escaped from Duan Ge's room.
 

 
Her fair cheeks were slightly flushed from the hug. After closing the door, she angrily wiped her face with the back of her hand and kicked Duan Ge's door as she turned to leave.
 

 
"Why are you so angry?"
 

 
A male voice came from behind her, and Tong Zhao turned around.
 

 
Han Zhi was smiling at her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Wait! Does her palace of consciousness operate like a shared rental? Is that even reasonable? Can her mind really hold that many fully developed characters? They can even engage in logical, peaceful conversations..."
 

 
While the evaluator's worldview shattered, he asked Dr. Gu, "Does this count as schizophrenia?"
 

 
"Your understanding of schizophrenia might be based on artistic representations," Dr. Gu replied.
 

 
The evaluator said, "Got it, multiple personalities aren’t this exaggerated."
 

 
Dr. Gu nodded, "I can’t say it’s completely out of the question."
 

 
While such cases are rare, they don't fall into illegal territory. Dr. Gu was more concerned about Tong Zhao’s physical health—one's brain functions like a hard drive, with a limited capacity. Even if no one knows the exact limit, having more than ten doors in this scenario, each potentially housing a "Tong Zhao," would be a heavy burden on her mind.
 

 
A rather bizarre image popped into Dr. Gu's head.
 

 
In her palace of consciousness, Tong Zhao could hold an "AKB48" general election and a "Produce 101" audition all by herself. Can you play mahjong alone? Sorry, I can complete an audition all by myself!
 

 
Well, Dr. Gu’s concerns didn’t materialize.
 

 
Besides Han Zhi, Tong Zhao only encountered two other people. The remaining doors, no matter how she twisted the knobs, were locked.
 

 
"Should we give her another suggestion?" the evaluator asked Dr. Gu.
 

 
"No, that’s enough."
 

 
Dr. Gu said.
 

 
After receiving Dr. Gu's permission, the evaluator gently extracted Tong Zhao's subconscious from the holographic scan. At the same time, Tong Zhao, lying in the chamber, slowly opened her eyes.
 

 
Unlike the slight headache she usually felt after filming, this time she felt refreshed.
 

 
After sitting up and facing the two, she asked, "How long was I out?"
 

 
"Fifteen minutes," Dr. Gu paused. "How do you feel now? If you start to feel any headaches, I recommend going to the next room for some observation. Some professional therapists can help you relax through massage."
 

 
Unlike filming a movie, this examination was like a self-reflection.
 

 
Not everyone can walk away feeling comfortable.
 

 
Of course, it’s generally not a serious issue.
 

 
Dr. Gu had seen a client who had a breakdown, crying in her room and tearing apart a teddy bear that represented her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
"I don't need that for now."
 

 
"You can take a look at the recordings first."
 

 
Dr. Gu turned the tablet around so Tong Zhao could watch the replay.
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao saw herself interacting with her other personas in visual form. Although she could talk to them anytime in her mind, it lacked the physicality of a hug. During lonely times, she could only lie in bed hugging a long pillow.
 

 
It turned out she had always wanted to embrace herself in her subconscious.
 

 
The usually aloof Tong Zhao felt a bit embarrassed in front of others.
 

 
Concubine Chen found it hard to accept: [Why is this side of me so childish? I should be the one hugging you.]
 

 
Brother Duan, having had the rare opportunity to hug Tong Zhao, was eager to recover that brief memory.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao did not exhibit any antisocial tendencies during the examination, nor did she show any self-destructive inclinations rumored due to a lack of pain perception, Dr. Gu issued her a mental health certificate but reminded her:
 

 
"I'm not sure if you have a split personality, because in past clients with similar mental disorders, awareness of other personalities often leads to aggressive behavior... A body is like a ship; it only needs one captain, and everyone wants to give orders."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "But I don't."
 

 
"Right, you don't, so I think you can't be classified as having schizophrenia. You are quite whole," Dr. Gu affirmed her statement before gently suggesting, "If each door holds a different version of you, my advice is not to open too many doors."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused.
 

 
Seeing her hesitation, Dr. Gu chose not to press the topic further and instead discussed the promising box office trends of "Heartless Tribulation," even asking her for a photo and autograph with a fan-like enthusiasm. Tong Zhao was glad to change the subject and left after taking the picture. Before she walked away, she turned back and sincerely said:
 

 
"I'll think carefully about whether to open the next door. Thank you for your reminder."
 

 
Dr. Gu is a well-known scholar in the industry and holds significant standing within the Film Association. Without knowing of the system's existence, he gave advice similar to what the system had suggested—
 

 
The system had also indicated that with her current mental strength, she shouldn’t forcibly open too many doors.
 

 
However, not opening those doors meant some experiences and memories from certain worlds would be forever forgotten.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Don’t push yourself.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I know.]
 

 
Stepping out of the association's building, the flow of traffic and heat hit her face.
 

 
By the side of a minivan parked across the street stood her assistant, waving at her. The mundane reality felt like an anchor, stabilizing her steps as she quietly said:
 

 
"Becoming whole is everyone’s wish. If I can't even remember my past self, then the Tong Zhao of that time would be left there forever, right? I don’t want that."
 

 
Dr. Gu mentioned that many with split personalities display strong aggression toward their other selves.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the opposite.
 

 
She loved herself too much.
 

 
To the world, a small Tong Zhao was insignificant, and a brief segment of her long life was even more trivial.
 

 
Yet she would take on more instinctive films, exercising and expanding her mental strength time and again until she could open the next door.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Please wait for me a bit longer.]
 

 
…
 

 
In her mind, the other personas, recalling the examination, complained: [Tong Zhao just pushes herself too much; no wonder we all want to hug her in our subconscious.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I hugged her the hardest.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [I want to hug her too.]
 

 
…
 

 
After discussing with her manager, Tong Zhao decided to hand over the fifteen-minute video to a professional for review and editing, removing any unnecessary and redundant shots.
 

 
Fortunately, she had many skilled colleagues in her WeChat contacts, so she posted a status.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Does anyone know how to edit short videos and do post-production? Paid help needed.]
 

 
It was rare for Sister Zhao to post, and soon there was a long string of likes and comments, including some post-editing professionals she had previously added.
 

 
Just as she was about to pick someone familiar and reliable, she spotted a particularly familiar name—
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Am I qualified?]
 

 
Post-Production A: 【……】
 

 
Post-Production B: 【…… oh wow】
 

 
This was Shi Qianqiu!
 

 
His editing skills were top-notch, and every film project he worked on was a hit.
 

 
Back in school, he was said to have a million-follower fan account for film-related content, which was his underground alias. He gained fame for skillfully editing Harry Potter and Qingwen into an outrageous couple, but he never admitted it, making it an open secret in the industry.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wasn’t qualified, who could claim they were?
 

 
As soon as he applied, other editors felt sidelined.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it both amusing and frustrating, and immediately messaged him: [I can't afford you, you're too expensive.]
 

 
She couldn’t even imagine his fees.
 

 
[I don’t charge. I’m just bored, and my hands are itching. Is what you want to edit too troublesome? If there’s room for creativity, I’d love to try; if it’s dull, then forget it.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was very straightforward, which was the kind of person Tong Zhao enjoyed dealing with.
 

 
She sent him the short video: [This was filmed when I went to the association for an examination.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’ll take it.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You haven’t even watched it yet?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [A video with you in it will definitely not be boring.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was pleasantly surprised by the compliment.
 

 
His way of flattering people was unique, often leaving them speechless, with Xu Zhu and Chen Zhuzhi being perfect examples. But when he complimented her, he acted quite normally. After agreeing to edit, he went quiet, and Tong Zhao didn’t rush him. Meanwhile, her manager checked in: “Have you found a post-production editor? If not, I can recommend someone.”
 

 
“I found one.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked, “When will it be done?”
 

 
“I don’t know; I’ll leave it to him.”
 

 
"Who has such an attitude?" Sister Chu frowned, worried that Tong Zhao might be misled. Her own pampered artist always seemed so obedient. Despite Tong Zhao being fierce with outsiders, she was especially kind to her assistants and other behind-the-scenes staff; she wouldn’t lose her temper over small mistakes.
 

 
Which post-production editor had the audacity to act like this with Sister Zhao?
 

 
Tong Zhao, sipping her warm water slowly, mentioned a name: "Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
"……"
 

 
Sister Chu covered her face and retreated in defeat.
 

 
They would just have to wait; Shi Qianqiu was more of an artist than a worker.
 

 
In art, taking time to produce quality work was normal.
 

 
After getting Shi Qianqiu’s consent, Tong Zhao’s manager took their half-true collaboration news to market, capitalizing on the popularity of "The Heartless Tribulation" to elevate Tong Zhao's status…
 

 
To become a big star, a solid body of work was essential, and marketing could accelerate that process.
 

 
How to convince the public that she was a big star?
 

 
Collaborate frequently with major directors and screenwriters; have box office hits; hold high-end endorsements; and receive numerous positive reviews… Once the hype was in place, she could ride the wave.
 

 
Unexpectedly, after a week, Shi Qianqiu sent two finished products to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【One is just a simple edit.】
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: 【The original footage was good, so I added some extra material and edited it into an experimental short film. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to release it; consider it a gift for you to enjoy.】
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was preparing with her manager to head to the deserted island for promotional filming, so they watched it together.
 

 
They had both seen the original footage, which was an unremarkable fan-made short.
 

 
Fans would naturally be happy to see their sister in different styles, but it didn’t tell much of a story.
 

 
Tong Zhao sought a post-production editor just to make it more concise and add suitable background music.
 

 
In the end, Shi Qianqiu delivered a microfilm.
 

 
After watching the film, Chu Jie turned to her in a daze and said, "This... isn't cheap, right?”
# Chapter63
The two of them skeptically watched it again.
 

 
Since Shi Qianqiu said he only added a bit of material, Tong Zhao and her agent initially didn’t think too much of it and just watched it as a routine check.
 

 
—“I’m looking for something.”
 

 
—“Where is it?”
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard typing, these two lines of text gradually appeared on the dark screen, voiced by Tong Zhao with a hint of confusion and hesitation. She had just entered the holographic filming and received the evaluator’s suggestion, making her tone especially uncertain.
 

 
Using these two lines as a lead immediately piqued the audience’s curiosity about why Tong Zhao was showing a vulnerable side.
 

 
Tong Zhao and her agent had seen the original footage.
 

 
The suspense created by Shi Qianqiu was ineffective for them; they naturally assumed the next scene would be Tong Zhao's consciousness palace…
 

 
However, it wasn’t.
 

 
When the dark curtain was lifted, it turned out to be a scene from "Countdown 72 Hours," where Tong Zhao played Feng Yanqi, showing her looking around in a weapon shop for suitable firearms, highlighting the theme of "searching."
 

 
—“At any cost.”
 

 
The tone of this line was particularly high and aloof, carrying a ruthless determination that indicated no matter the means, even sacrificing everyone to achieve the goal was acceptable. Outside of the scene, Tong Zhao thought about it and concluded it was neither from "72 Hours" nor from the inspection results.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [From "Sea King Kill."]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [...He even watched that!]
 

 
The beautiful woman was speechless.
 

 
Following that ruthless line about "at any cost," Feng Yanqi's accelerated beatdown of the robbers began, with each strike perfectly timed to the background music's rhythm, creating a strong sense of impact. In the frame, she appeared as a fierce and stunning female warrior. The camera then zoomed in on her plucking bullets with tweezers, before suddenly closing in on a gruesome wound, taking up the entire shot. This was followed by Feng Yanqi, with a high level of intensity, storming into the research facility, shooting through hordes of zombies and engaging in close combat, ultimately collapsing from exhaustion.
 

 
"This transition!" Sister Chu exclaimed again.
 

 
"The fan-made vibe is so strong; that million-follower editor on Bilibili must be him." As Tong Zhao prepared for "Heartless Tribulation," she wanted to learn more about the director and proactively looked up news related to Shi Qianqiu, which included this information.
 

 
In the film, Feng Yanqi collapsed, closing her eyes.
 

 
Those who have seen "72 Hours" know that she gets the antidote and won't die.
 

 
However, at the moment she shut her eyes, the sound of a door opening echoed.
 

 
Behind the door was a shabby old storage room, filled to the brim with clutter.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, while the space was cramped, the items were organized in a very orderly manner and not messy at all. However, it was still not a comfortable room to stay in, and the nylon bed tucked in the corner only deepened this sense of discomfort.
 

 
On the bed, Duan Ge (brother) looked like a more mature Feng Yanqi, her face showing signs of age.
 

 
The world isn't just filled with youthful beauties; every age has its own charm. Duan Ge clearly lived a turbulent life, and her features, weathered by hardship, remained strikingly beautiful and aggressively alluring. The same high bridge of her nose and deep-set eyes that appeared on Concubine Chen's face had a seductive allure, while on Duan Ge, they resembled a brightly colored leopard—dazzling yet intimidating, making one awestruck but not daring to touch.
 

 
The original scene was softened by the dim yellow oil lamp, but Shi Qianqiu altered its tone, making it heavy and oppressive.
 

 
The oil lamp cast the silhouette of a slender figure against the wall as someone entered.
 

 
Who is this uninvited guest?
 

 
This was the hint and information provided by the visuals and background music.
 

 
Duan Ge looked up and smiled, "What a rare visitor."
 

 
"I came to find something."
 

 
Following Duan Ge's upward motion, the camera shifted too.
 

 
This camera movement allowed the viewers to share Duan Ge's perspective and clearly see the visitor—it was actually Tong Zhao! She was dressed in casual attire, looking most like her real-life self.
 

 
At this moment, the camera didn’t capture Duan Ge’s expression, even cutting out her voice, focusing instead on her tightly gripped Swiss Army knife, conveying the message that "Feng Yanqi is unhappy to see Tong Zhao" through body language alone.
 

 
Duan Ge: "At that time, I just wanted to hug Tong Zhao so badly that I tightened my grip on the Swiss Army knife."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "But you still hugged me, didn’t you?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "I couldn’t help it."
 

 
The next moment showed Duan Ge stepping forward to tightly embrace Tong Zhao.
 

 
— "Killing is a heavy crime," came the husky, mature tone of Duan Ge.
 

 
— "Isn’t it only natural to listen to me?" This was a cheeky, arrogant line from Concubine Chen.
 

 
Duan Ge held on tightly, burying her face in Tong Zhao's hair.
 

 
Removing their real dialogue and adding somber, tense background music made the conveyed message very clear, leaving behind huge questions... This mature version of Tong Zhao listened to her orders to kill while simultaneously searching for something, establishing a clear dominant-submissive relationship between them.
 

 
The question remained: What were they searching for? Why did they share such strikingly similar features?
 

 
Montage editing can manipulate time and space, playing with the narrative. The director would cut out scenes deemed unnecessary, sometimes inserting footage from different timelines, locations, or even entirely different films to construct a fabricated storyline.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "What does this Shi person mean? Am I ordering Duan Ge to kill?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "If you need it, I'm more than willing."
 

 
Concubine Chen giggled delightfully.
 

 
In the film, immediately after "Isn't it only natural to listen to me?" was a passionate kiss between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao in the pottery studio from "Sea King Kill"...
 

 
After a long kiss, they locked eyes, and Han Zhi whispered:
 

 
"Of course, I'll listen to you."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had somehow obtained a lossless audio version, and with headphones on, it felt as if Han Zhi was whispering directly into the viewers' ears, causing Sister Chu to blush, while she was left stunned by this cross-genre dialogue: "This works too?"
 

 
"Basic operation. It’s clear you don’t often watch romantic pairing edits.”
 

 
Hearing her artist say this, Sister Chu began to consider spending more time on Bilibili.
 

 
She followed the data feedback from major video platforms, but terms like "la lang" left her feeling completely confused.
 

 
Next, they cut to clips of Han Zhi flirting with Zhong Muxi and Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The two girls were infatuated with their idol, interspersed with Han Zhi's gaze towards them that hinted at pity, suggesting he was seducing them at Tong Zhao's command, something he didn't want to do. The final clip of Zhong Muxi self-harming placed the blame squarely on Han Zhi.
 

 
Han Zhi: "..."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Wow, my brother's reputation is suffering."
 

 
However, the next clip split the blame between Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—
 

 
Leaning lazily against the doorframe, Tong Zhao asked, "She didn’t cry and run away?"
 

 
After speaking, a haughty smile appeared on her delicate, beautiful face, exuding a poisonous charm.
 

 
— "Nowhere to be found; I can’t find it."
 

 
Tong Zhao's voice in the monologue grew increasingly irritable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "This is what I said in 'Sea King Kill' when I couldn’t find Wei Zekai."
 

 
The ending of this segment transitioned to an empty mansion, suggesting abandonment.
 

 
— "Sometimes I feel like he needs a little stimulation."
 

 
— "Without some stimulation, how would he know the potential he could unleash?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is…"
 

 
Chen Guifei: "I saw He Shun's inner monologue.”
 

 
Sure.
 

 
What played next was a scene of Chen Zhuzhi portraying Shao Xuanzheng, pacing back and forth in front of the alchemy furnace on the night before he attacked his partner, murmuring, "If I really do this, there’s no turning back..."
 

 
The shadows on the alchemy furnace flickered, accompanied by Tong Zhao's light, arrogant mockery: "Always thinking about turning back; no wonder you achieve nothing."
 

 
This was from "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the concubine belittles the other consorts.
 

 
Shao Xuanzheng's inner struggle was edited by Shi Qianqiu into a dialogue.
 

 
Next, it seemed that everything Mu Yingchen suffered was manipulated by Tong Zhao from behind.
 

 
Concubine Chen praised sweetly: "This segment is well edited; Director Shi is a genius!"
 

 
The edit focused on her bullying of Lu Xianzhang, and Shi Qianqiu immediately elevated from "that Shi" to "Director Shi," changing his tone faster than flipping a page.
 

 
The manager was speechless: "Is Director Shi playing with his own film?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "He seems to be having a lot of fun."
 

 
After the misleading editing of "Heartless Tribulation," the scene shifted to Tong Zhao visiting Lu Xianzhang in the consciousness palace. At that moment, Lu Xianzhang was meditating in a corner, giving Shi Qianqiu ample space to create something out of nothing, first cutting to Lu Xianzhang with his eyes closed—
 

 
Lu Xianzhang appeared as a twenty-eight-year-old version of Tong Zhao, about the same age as Duan Ge, but showing signs of a life of luxury, exuding a cool, ethereal presence like a fallen immortal.
 

 
Though it was the same face and age, viewers could clearly feel that this was not the same person.
 

 
Inserting Mu Yingchen's original voice: "Are you satisfied now?"
 

 
"I will never be satisfied." This was the concubine's line.
 

 
Under Shi Qianqiu's editing, "Tong Zhao" in the consciousness palace was searching for something while continuously issuing commands for these "selves" to do bad deeds, not hesitating to harm them to achieve her goals, clearly portraying a behind-the-scenes manipulator, a super big boss.
 

 
During the second viewing, Tong Zhao noticed a detail: "The order is reversed this time; in the original, I first saw the concubine, then went to the storage room."
 

 
Why edit it this way?
 

 
Is it just a matter of habit?
 

 
At this point, the scene switches to "The Legend of the Ming Emperor," where the first clip shows the concubine being pushed into a palace by her family, instructed to serve the emperor well and gain his favor. Her youthful face reveals a hint of fear and confusion. This segment was a hard-won edit by the director of "The Ming Emperor," as Tong Zhao usually appears very confident and ambitious.
 

 
What is weakness? It doesn't exist.
 

 
In the scene, the young Tong Zhao closes her eyes tightly, as if trying to blink away her tears.
 

 
When she opens her eyes again, she sees the luxurious concubine, who turns around with an air of unmatched nobility: "Are you here to accompany me?"
 

 
The playful words were cut out.
 

 
After seeing the younger face that resembled her own, Tong Zhao had a sudden realization about the arrangement of the scenes—
 

 
the age difference.
 

 
From maturity to innocence, the concubine is the younger one.
 

 
"Aren't you here specifically to find me?"
 

 
"Come here and hug me."
 

 
In the original version, Tong Zhao's words were completely muted, leaving only a silent, hopeless embrace.
 

 
In film and television, silence and blank spaces are also a form of expression.
 

 
This transitions into another embrace—between the Ming Emperor, played by Song Wanzhuo, and the concubine. She opens her arms to wrap around the emperor, tilting her face up to flirt with him for a moment before resting her head against his chest. From the emperor's unseen angle, her youthful and beautiful face breaks into a slight smile, and the ambitious spark in her eyes burns like two flames, making the concubine even more captivating.
 

 
Sister Chu commented, "This uses a contrast of strength and weakness. She wants to use the Ming Emperor, but when you embrace her, she is fully reliant on you."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Wanzhuo has become a reliable tool."
 

 
Fast forward to the concubine's grand ceremony.
 

 
The concubine said, "With the queen gone, I am now the most esteemed woman in the world."
 

 
She asked, "Are you satisfied?"
 

 
Under the clear sky, countless noblewomen bowed to her. The splendidly beautiful concubine, adorned with heavy makeup, appeared even more stunning, yet her true emotions remained inscrutable.
 

 
—“Not enough, still not enough.”
 

 
This line is also spoken by the concubine in "Ming Emperor."
 

 
Each word captures her insatiable ambition and darkness.
 

 
Outside of the scene, the concubine remarked, "So, I even torment myself when I go crazy?"
 

 
The camera ended with a shot of a noblewoman who once troubled the concubine, bowing her head in resentment. As she lowered her head, the view went dark, and when it brightened again, it revealed a door opening in the consciousness palace.
 

 
This time, it was a door leading out from a room into a vast white hall…
 

 
“Tong Zhao.”
 

 
It was Han Zhi's voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to meet his deep, melancholic eyes.
 

 
Here, apart from the call, all other lines were cut, and unnecessary contact was removed, leaving only Tong Zhao walking toward one of the rooms.
 

 
The door was opened just a crack, but was caught by a security chain.
 

 
A small, soft white hand reached out from within.
 

 
At this moment, Shi Qianqiu pulled a side mirror for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Cold white light shone from the side, casting deeper contrasts on her expressionless face. Her pale eyes churned with nameless emotions, resembling an unfathomable abyss. Objectively speaking, Tong Zhao's expression was serious and heavy, with a hint of struggle that made her appear somewhat fierce.
 

 
—“You’re next.”
 

 
This was the thought of the concubine when she saw Wei Zekai in "Sea King Kill."
 

 
As soon as the words fell, that obviously childlike hand was firmly grasped by Tong Zhao.
 

 
The screen abruptly plunged into darkness.
 

 
---
 

 
Starring: Tong Zhao
 

 
Post-production: Shi Qianqiu
 

 
Acknowledgments: Copyright holders of "The Legend of Ming Emperor," "Sea King Kill," "Countdown 72 Hours," and "Heartless Tribulation.”
 

 
---
 

 
The manager, Sister Chu, was a bit suspicious of her eyes. She opened the original film on her phone and scrolled to the last part.
 

 
When the last door was stuck by the security chain, a childish voice from behind it apologized, "Zhao Zhao, I'm sorry. I can’t reach the chain even if I jump."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded patiently, "It's okay, I'll find a way."
 

 
Then she comfortingly held the child's small hand.
 

 
The two clearly had a very close relationship, trusting each other.
 

 
However, under the editing of Shi Qianqiu, Tong Zhao was portrayed as a cruel and cold mysterious figure, behind whose manipulation lay the misfortunes of many worlds, ultimately even resorting to harming innocent children. After watching this footage, Dr. Gu from the Instinct Film Association would likely suspect her of having antisocial and inhumane tendencies.
 

 
In plain terms, she was edited into a villainous character.
 

 
Although there are too many flaws to know where to start, objectively speaking, Tong Zhao admits that Shi Qianqiu made the character of "Tong Zhao" quite charming. Whether it’s the color grading, camera angles, or the accompanying BGM, she appears as a dark and beautiful mysterious villain.
 

 
She sent a message to Shi Qianqiu: "So what is the protagonist actually looking for?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: "I don’t know!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "It was just an idea from the evaluator for you to explore the consciousness palace more, to gather more information—there's no deeper reason."
 

 
Good point, “I don’t know.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Then didn’t you just turn it into a story? Digging a pit and not filling it?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Digging pits and not filling them is indeed one of my specialties.”
 

 
Tong Zhao remembered and opened Shi Qianqiu's Bilibili account, checking the section labeled "His Videos." It featured his representative work, "[Harry X Qingwen] So Sexual," along with a bunch of "series" like "When Qingwen Travels to the HP World (Part 1)," "Wang Xifeng Teaches Iron Man Business (Part 1)," "Jia Mu Visits Stark Tower (Part 1)," and "[Lu Zhishen X Loki] Mu Shaoai (Part 1)..."
 

 
The reason for the quotation marks around "series" is that once he finishes one, there’s no follow-up.
 

 
No matter how well-received or how many collections and likes he gets, he remains unfazed—no sequels, digging pits without filling them!
 

 
That's right.
 

 
As mentioned earlier, Shi Qianqiu is not a perfect person; he has bold ideas and creative editing but lacks strong logic. He often has short-lived enthusiasm, digs a pit, and then doesn’t want to fill it, with grand plans that he can't follow through. It's common for authors to finish works out of necessity, but he isn’t short on money and digs pits for fun, which is even more infuriating.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu kindly let her use the materials freely; he had already negotiated with the copyright holders.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Okay.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had inadvertently fallen into the pit, no longer wanted to talk to the "Pit King."
 

 
She explained the situation and posted both versions edited by Shiqianqiu on Weibo.
 

 
@TongZhaov:
 

 
"Did a check at the association.
 

 
@ShiQianqiu helped edit the film, adding a bit of material for a micro-movie version. Watch whichever you prefer."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted the micro-movie version on Weibo.
 

 
So, while her agent was marketing behind the scenes, they mainly pushed that post... In reality, the marketing money was just icing on the cake. Who is Shi Qianqiu? Tong Zhao is currently the hottest actress, with countless eyes focused on her. There had been speculation about their collaboration, and some imaginative netizens even claimed that their next joint announcement would definitely be about a wedding.
 

 
This scared many of Tong Zhao's career fans.
 

 
When her family matters were brought to light, her mother—who had once won a Best Actress award—was also dug up. Fans feared that Tong Zhao might end up like her mother, marrying and retiring from acting with no more works. They really didn’t want her to date—after all, they hadn’t seen enough of her films!
 

 
Instead of wedding news, fans received a micro-movie.
 

 
While they felt relieved, they were also a bit pleased.
 

 
In the past, some actors had shared their examination videos from the Association, creating an intimate feeling similar to reading a diary from their idol's private account.
 

 
Non-fans were also curious about Tong Zhao's examination results.
 

 
After all, she was known for her strong and unique subconscious.
 

 
How special could she be without the halo of her character templates?
 

 
Fans and onlookers clicked on the original link to the micro-movie.
 

 
It started with clips from "Countdown 72 Hours," and early fans were quite happy, but soon they sensed something was off.
 

 
First, a flood of question marks filled the screen.
 

 
[？？？？]
 

 
[Wow, where's this footage from? So much information!]
 

 
[Strangers asking for the source—this scene of a handsome guy being told to raise fish is so engaging, which idol drama is it from?]
 

 
[Hey, don't go, that’s not an idol drama; it’s from the variety show "Sea King Kill," and the truth isn’t like that…]
 

 
[Fans who have watched all of Tong Zhao's works assure you that the original story isn't set up this way!]
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans found themselves in a bizarre loop of accepting the problematic setting, thinking, “Once you accept it, it really feels amazing.” Meanwhile, confused onlookers became curious about the "original work," and after some explanation, they regretfully questioned:
 

 
[Alright then, where are these different age versions of Tong Zhao from?]
 

 
This…
 

 
The fans didn't know either.
 

 
Fortunately, the micro-movie was quite short. After watching it, the puzzled fans immediately went to see the examination result video edited by Shi Qianqiu, which was generally more authentic. This video's comments were sparse, and its view count was less than half that of the micro-movie.
 

 
[How many people are hidden in Sister Zhao’s mind???]
 

 
[Wow, don't worry about the number; just think about how much space is in a room—her subconscious intensity must be terrifying.]
 

 
[Incredible, Sister Zhao doesn't need character settings; she’s special enough on her own.]
 

 
[Is this really okay? The Association determined Zhao Zhao is healthy?] This came from fans who cared about Tong Zhao's well-being.
 

 
Discussion about Tong Zhao herself was mostly from those concerned about the entertainment industry.
 

 
Outsiders who only watched the micro-movie edited by Shi Qianqiu were captivated by the fabricated plot, thinking it was a trailer for some lengthy TV drama.
 

 
This clearly has a complete worldview and suspense that can be deeply explored!
 

 
So, some insiders, eager for drama, started spreading the news: “Shi Qianqiu is venturing into TV dramas! Once again collaborating with Tong Zhao for an ultra-long exquisite trailer
 

 
[video link]
 

 

 
.”
 

 
There’s even a plot summary, making it sound like a classic quick-transmigration story.
 

 
The production quality of this micro-movie is indeed excellent—its pacing is quick, easy to understand, and engaging. The suspense of the main character, who is also the behind-the-scenes antagonist, searching for something runs throughout the trailer, leading to unexpected buzz. It topped the daily charts of major video platforms, and even with fans frequently clarifying that this is not a TV drama, many netizens kept asking in confusion:
 

 
[When is Tong Zhao’s new drama airing?]
 

 
[Is Song Wanzhuo playing a supporting role? Zhao Jie is amazing!]
 

 
[Have I seen this Han Zhi before?]
 

 
With such a high-quality production, how could it just be a fan vlog?
 

 
It must be fans playing a joke!
 

 
…
 

 
Daily monitoring market feedback, agent Sister Chu remarked, “Tong Zhao, if you don’t turn this into a TV drama, it’ll be hard to wrap things up.”
 

 
“...Who cares? I’m off to survive on a deserted island.”
# Chapter64
It was originally possible to love whoever.
 

 
Imagination can be very aloof, but reality is full of complexities.
 

 
While the edited version went viral, surprisingly, the original version saw a drop in shares the next day in an unexpected manner—
 

 
Generally speaking, a Weibo post that gets thousands of shares goes through a fermentation process. It rises to a peak, then those interested share it early, followed by a stagnation and gradual decline until it fades into obscurity—this is the norm on Weibo.
 

 
Unless someone stirs the pot.
 

 
And someone did.
 

 
"Zhang Wenshi's Sharp Commentary: Tong Zhao is a Distorted Product of the Era's Excessive Reverence for Unique Subconsciousness"
 

 
[On October 22, 20xx, a sensational xianxia film officially premiered in all of Huaxia. This film faced countless doubts from preparation to release, with criticisms that no one could fulfill the role of the female lead. Then, Tong Zhao, symbolizing the "correct answer," fit in like the final puzzle piece of the film.]
 

 
Subsequently, the two biggest attention-seekers in all of Huaxia "collaborated" again, releasing a microfilm and a meticulously edited inspection video.
 

 
[In the era of instinctive cinema, unique subconsciousness is revered.]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is the most devoted follower of this genre. As a screenwriter, his actions are shameful; he indulges actors in straying from the path in the film and then calls it a masterpiece when they accidentally get it right? I cannot agree with that.]
 

 
[From Tong Zhao's original inspection footage, it’s clear that her most unique subconscious trait is possessing numerous distinct "personalities," rich enough for a holographic scanning system to model them in the palace of consciousness... I admit this is indeed special, but is it really worthy of praise?]
 

 
[Amidst all the admiration and accolades, I still have to say no.]
 

 
[Looking back, did Tong Zhao present different performances in "The Legend of Ming Emperor," "Countdown 72 Hours," and "Heartless Tribulation"? Is that truly excellent for instinctive cinema? Or is it an unstable hidden bomb? In the first three instances, she lucked out by showcasing the right side... Just think, if Tong Zhao from her concubine period were to star in a post-apocalyptic survival film, it would be a disaster!]
 

 
[The subconscious stability of seasoned instinctive actors only experiences a few fluctuations throughout their long careers due to real-life experiences, which is an understandable norm. From Tong Zhao's films, it's evident that she possesses far too much uncertainty; every performance is like rolling dice!]
 

 
[The vast majority of instinctive actors are quite stable, consistently playing similar roles and delivering outstanding performances. Tong Zhao relies on this characteristic to take chances in her films... I must admit, her luck is quite good; she always manages to roll the side she wants.]
 

 
[The emergence of this distorted unstable subconscious may be a responsibility we all share.]
 

 
[It is a tragedy of this era, and also a tragedy for the new generation of instinctive actors—]
 

 
[Just a friendly reminder, aside from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao has never used the same "personality" twice.]
 

 
……
 

 
This pointedly controversial post was shared by several entertainment accounts with millions of followers.
 

 
Fans and bystanders were a bit confused in the replies.
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has never done anything extreme or stirred up negative news; her public image is that of someone who works diligently.
 

 
However, after glancing a few times, bystanders found some validity in what this Zhang said.
 

 
Tong Zhao's subconscious is indeed quite unique!
 

 
Mainstream voices pursuing distinct subconsciousness might be overhyping it, potentially giving rise to a new generation of "Tong Zhaos." Clicking into the original post's comments revealed a flood of similar sentiments, expressing concern that Tong Zhao's unconventional acting style would ultimately lead to her downfall.
 

 
The retweets displayed a variety of opinions.
 

 
Some argued that he shouldn’t have criticized her by name, claiming it was overly provocative.
 

 
Others said he was just stirring the pot for attention, pointing out that Tong Zhao had never actually faltered in her performances.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi separately retweeted with: [I’m not targeting her; I’m targeting this kind of atmosphere.]
 

 
Some retweets wondered why the original post's comments were so one-sided.
 

 
It turned out the blogger had enabled a feature that highlights selected comments, which is why all the visible responses agreed with her. Uninformed netizens saw the comments and developed a herd mentality.
 

 
[Tong Zhao, whose heart did you stab? Look how sour the original poster is.]
 

 
[Check the box office of "Heartless Tribulation," then take a look at the industry... Turns out they aren't jealous of Tong Zhao; they're envious of Shi Qianqiu but don’t want to be too obvious, so they target Tong Zhao instead. After all, she is Shi Qianqiu’s most admired subconscious!]
 

 
[Witnessing the meltdown of a loser screenwriter.]
 

 
[Not every screenwriter gets to work with a subconscious as exceptional as Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
[Am I the only one who thinks the original poster's concerns are quite reasonable?]
 

 
---
 

 
Zhang Wenshi mentioning both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu essentially included "Heartless Tribulation" in the conversation.
 

 
The number of retweets surprised even him.
 

 
After all, the film's buzz had been extremely high lately—
 

 
How high?
 

 
Within three days of its release, the top trending topic on Zhihu was "How to evaluate the movie 'Heartless Tribulation'?"
 

 
Following that were various related questions and articles. Not only serious titles like "In-Depth Analysis of 'Heartless Tribulation'! The True Meaning Behind Mu Yingchen's Quest for the Sword," and "Who dares to say they understand Tong Zhao?" but also open-ended storytelling questions like "If you were Mu Yingchen, how would you break the deadlock?" had numerous responses.
 

 
The enthusiasm for the movie among netizens is clearly still high.
 

 
When you're on the cutting edge, even pigs can fly.
 

 
"Heartless Tribulation" is a hot topic right now, and Zhang Wenshi has opened this conversation from an alternative angle.
 

 
Previous discussions mainly focused on the film itself.
 

 
His critical review shifted the audience's attention from the movie to Tong Zhao's subconscious traits.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Who is this Zhang Wenshi?"
 

 
The article was sent to her by an outraged assistant, and discussions were also happening in the crew's WeChat group. Tong Zhao couldn't recall offending him and felt a bit confused.
 

 
But after a moment of bewilderment, she regained her composure.
 

 
Even a scathing piece like this could gain traction, indicating she's riding the wave of popularity—something to be happy about.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Yeah, who is it?"
 

 
As soon as he popped up, a prop master chimed in: "It's your rival, Director Shi! He's your counterpart!"
 

 
Director Shi was shocked: "I have a rival?"
 

 
Immediately, a more informed crew member jumped in to enlighten them about the situation.
 

 
He indeed has a rival.
 

 
In fact, the number of rivals he has might even exceed some popular figures in the industry.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu is straightforward and often acts arrogantly, which has drawn criticism from many within the industry.
 

 
He was very easygoing with his subordinates and staff. Teased as the last eunuch in China for his habit of digging holes and not filling them, he didn’t take offense when called “Old Thief Shi” or “Eunuch Shi.” Sometimes, if the jokes went on too long, he would cryptically remark, “Impotence is actually the key to unlocking the second gate of wisdom for men; it's a blessing,” leaving people too stunned to continue murmuring about him.
 

 
With his peers, if someone wanted to discuss professional topics, he wouldn’t beat around the bush. He said exactly what he thought, often putting others in awkward positions. Yet, he had a divine talent for editing and directing, as if fate itself was feeding him.
 

 
At one dinner, the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi of "Non-Official Lover" learned that Shi Qianqiu had seen the preview of his film and insisted on getting his feedback. After being turned down twice, Zhang insisted on downing three drinks as a form of self-punishment, claiming that if Shi didn’t provide feedback, he should at least drink with him.
 

 
Shi wasn’t angry. Instead, he looked at Zhang with pity, thinking how poorly written it was, yet the writer was so eager to improve that he openly sought advice. It was truly a spirit of literary sacrifice.
 

 
"Alright, let’s help him out."
 

 
"I did watch 'Non-Official Lover.' I was quite surprised to see someone deliberately avoiding all the popular answers for innovation. It’s easy to imagine the writer trying to break the mold and ending up with a hodgepodge of disconnected sketches. Since the story wasn’t told well and didn’t please the audience... My suggestion? The best advice is to stop treating the audience and mainstream as fools. If you don’t understand why certain tropes are popular, don’t try to break them. Show some respect for your audience."
 

 
After encouraging drinking all evening, the previously tipsy screenwriter Zhang Wenshi instantly sobered up.
 

 
He couldn’t have been more awake.
 

 
The room fell silent, with the women he had forced to drink stifling laughter to the point of oxygen deprivation.
 

 
When "Non-Official Lover" was released, the box office indeed crashed, just as Shi Qianqiu predicted. A well-known critic, unaware of their feud, gave a similar review: "The screenwriter seems to misunderstand tropes. In the process of exploring innovation, constant attempts can overwhelm a film. If the skill isn’t sufficient, there shouldn’t be more than one or one-and-a-half innovative attempts in a single movie—films require guiding the audience. If the director is also uncertain, how can they lead?" He ended with recognition of the writer’s innovative spirit, giving him face.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was right about everything.
 

 
But he was too harsh.
 

 
The consequence of being harsh is having no friends, spending every day digging holes at home. Shi willingly accepted this outcome, conveniently avoiding unnecessary social interactions. Some colleagues, struck by his critiques but unwilling to admit it, harbored grudges against him while trying to console themselves that he simply couldn’t give compliments.
 

 
Humans are strange creatures; when one discovers that someone is consistently critical, it softens the sting of their own criticisms.
 

 
This balance worked well—until the anomaly, Tong Zhao, appeared.
 

 
Shi praised her highly, proving that he could indeed speak kindly. His compliments and criticisms were genuine, which only made those he had criticized feel even worse about themselves.
 

 
Take the screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, for instance.
 

 
He was quite pleased when "Heartless Tribulation" was indefinitely shelved due to the inability to find a lead actress, secretly celebrating with champagne at home—how could Shi Qianqiu criticize him for having high expectations? At Shi's standards for female leads, it could take ten more years to make this film!
 

 
However, before he could finish the discounted champagne, "Heartless Tribulation" officially announced its lead actress.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi: …damn it.
 

 
As he watched the film rise to great heights, breaking box office records, he…
 

 
Had nothing better to do than write little essays and shower praise on Tong Zhao, damn!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi's mindset could have been balanced; it was Tong Zhao who ruined it for him.
 

 
He bought the viewing rights for "Heartless Tribulation" and watched it in a holographic cinema no less than three times. Given Shi Qianqiu's negative reputation with him, along with the bias of his colleagues, he couldn’t understand why this film was so successful.
 

 
It was too cliché!
 

 
Wasn’t it just a typical female empowerment story?
 

 
Although Zhang Wenshi didn’t predict that Mu Yingchen would experience a rebirth through adversity, he did foresee the reversal. The later Goldfinger moments given to the female lead by Shi were plentiful—Tong Zhao delivered a performance worthy of the extravagant budget, delighting the audience and reflecting positively at the box office, leading to a significant profit.
 

 
Box office figures are straightforward data that can be checked online at any time.
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming praise for the two of them in the news, Zhang Wenshi felt a slight crack in his composure.
 

 
Initially, he simply disliked Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
He believed that "Heartless Tribulation" became successful due to the lead actress's influence. If he could get Tong Zhao for his own project, he could also create a blockbuster!
 

 
Zhang Wenshi happened to be working on a film that still needed a lead actress. The director and producers agreed with his suggestion that Tong Zhao would be an excellent choice, so they sent the script to her agent, expressing their interest in inviting her.
 

 
Tong Zhao declined.
 

 
The film was titled "Chasing Immortals."
 

 
Just hearing the title felt like a trend-chaser, and Tong Zhao didn't want to repeat herself or slow her momentum; she needed to rest—so she turned it down casually, having rejected countless offers lately, and didn’t take this small matter to heart.
 

 
The director and producers of "Chasing Immortals" didn't mind much either.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao's market value was soaring, with billions in box office earnings. If she agreed to star in another fantasy film, that would truly shock them!
 

 
Only Zhang Wenshi cared deeply.
 

 
Without Tong Zhao, it seemed he could never compete on the same stage as Shi Qianqiu…
 

 
This "harsh critique" was a product of his imbalanced mindset.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi originally just wanted to vent, but he didn't expect many who envied "Heartless Tribulation" box office and resented Tong Zhao's recent success to rally behind him, firing the first shot against her—
 

 
Calling it an attack felt more like a way to vent their frustrations.
 

 
Tong Zhao had only just debuted a little over a year ago, and at such a young age, what if it affected her mindset? In the era of instinctual filmmaking, mindset has a significant impact on the subconscious. Some young actors, in order to adjust their mentality, choose to take breaks during their peak times.
 

 
"This is a psychological tactic; Zhang Wenshi seems like a fool being used in the moment… Just look at his previous conflicts with Shi Qianqiu to see he isn’t very smart."
 

 
Agent Chu analyzed this for Tong Zhao, hoping she wouldn’t be affected.
 

 
This is also a product of the instinctual filmmaking era, which focuses on actors' mindsets, akin to how they used to sabotage singers' voices.
 

 
"Don't worry, my mindset is solid; I’m very stable," Tong Zhao reassured her. "Think positively—I’m about to get popular again!"
 

 
Being comforted by an artist who could be her niece, Chu was a bit amused. She said, "You still have the energy to cheer me up! I'm fine; can there really be a problem? My biggest issue is that my throat hurts from all the calls I’ve been getting, all wanting to invite you to be the lead!"
 

 
"Isn't that the case with every project?"
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t react much.
 

 
"In the past, only similar types of projects would invite you. Now, well… I can’t say all, but among the scripts being produced daily in Huaxia, removing those who know they can’t afford you or those already designated with better options, most roles will first come to you. You’ll pick from what’s left, and only then will others get a chance to compete. Sigh, anyone who can call me has some skills; the rest just email me, which is making my eyesight worse.”
 

 
Sister Chu spoke with a tone that suggested regret yet was filled with genuine delight as she boasted.
 

 
After she finished, she glanced at Tong Zhao, waiting for her reaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “If your throat hurts, drink more warm water and make sure there’s plenty of light in the room.”
 

 
…Okay, her artist's mindset should be fine now.
 

 
The discussion in the WeChat group was lively; after all, this was clearly aimed at undermining ‘Heartless Tribulation’ and its golden crown.
 

 
Modeling artist: “Will it affect the box office? It hasn’t even peaked yet.”
 

 
Supporting actor: “Come on, Shi, do something. Isn’t it time to buy him some help?”
 

 
Ding Jiao: “Should I speak up to support Zhao Zhao? That guy is turning Tong Zhao into someone who seems ready to collapse at any moment!”
 

 
Fu Xiaoheng: “Support Sister Zhao!”
 

 
The actress playing Qing Niang, Fu Xiaoheng, was eager to call him Master. She felt a strong connection and was even more outraged than Tong Zhao, who was being slandered; she had already retweeted and blasted Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Should I respond?”
 

 
The director wanted to set a good example for everyone.
 

 
However, the crowd immediately restrained him.
 

 
He was a public relations disaster who spoke too loudly.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng understood and took on the responsibility, representing ‘Heartless Tribulation’ with a brief statement. He assured that the entire film's production was legal and compliant, with no crew members experiencing psychological issues during filming. He emphasized that the team didn’t glorify anyone but simply aimed to make a good movie while trying some new approaches to entertain the audience.
 

 
He shared this statement with the group for review before posting, receiving unanimous praise like “Top-notch bureaucratic tone,” “That basically means nothing!” and “This definitely won’t be a problem now!” among other affirmations.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng was relatively unknown, a non-entity in the film industry, with only a few thousand fans on Weibo—one-third bought, one-third given away.
 

 
His voice was reliable, but no one paid him any attention.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng: "Hey, Shi, you should retweet and support this!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu retweeted.
 

 
So he wanted him to back him up?
 

 
He was sincere, not cutting corners with fast-forward, and added, “Well said!” to show his support.
 

 
However, the comments and retweets below didn’t match Shi Qianqiu’s expectations—
 

 
[Deputy Director’s words seemed normal, but once Shi Old Thief retweeted, it took on a strange vibe.]
 

 
[Now it feels off.]
 

 
[Aren’t you going to say something else? We’re waiting for you to confront someone!]
 

 
Many were eager to see him clash with Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Netizens were excitedly following the situation. Since Shi Qianqiu retweeted the crew’s stance, Tong Zhao should come out and say something too! They kept refreshing Tong Zhao’s Weibo page until finally, her response appeared—
 

 
@Tong Zhao V:
 

 
“Well said! //@Shi Qianqiu: Well said!”
 

 
[Deputy Director Zeng’s Weibo]
 

 
…
 

 
Originally, Deputy Director Zeng’s serious comments became amusing after being mixed up with the two big names.
 

 
Fans, who were initially angry, were amused by their sister’s tweet.
 

 
[Sister, don’t get led astray! /laughing and crying/ laughing and crying.]
 

 
[If it goes astray, so be it. Isn’t optimism better? Just don’t let it affect your mindset. What’s so special about subconsciousness? I love every version of Tong Zhao (especially Han Zhi).]
 

 
[Same here! It’s all Tong Zhao herself (especially love for Han Zhi).]
 

 
Some of the popular comments got sidetracked, while the rest understood the main points the subject wanted to express, organizing their agreement—returning to the film itself, Tong Zhao is healthy, gets along well with the crew, and doesn’t give off any sour vibes.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans understood the message.
 

 
Deputy Director Zeng opened with a solid start, but he never expected the two to take a sharp turn, leaving the supporting cast to go along with the humor, using the format “Well said!” to uniformly express their stance.
 

 
These catchy four words washed over the audience’s minds.
 

 
# "The Heartless Tribulation" Crew: Well said! #
 

 
The tension was diffused by humor. It was the weekend, and many workers connected to the holographic network, interested in the topic on Weibo, bought viewing rights.
 

 
“Heartless Tribulation" not only exploded in popularity but also had lasting momentum.
 

 
Previously, there was a chorus of praise, and many were curious enough to watch, with some managing to hold back. Now that there were questioning voices, those who had hesitated were even more curious—
 

 
Is it really that good?
 

 
Good enough to make peers jump in frustration?
 

 
When Zhang Wenshi saw this question, he nearly had a heart attack from anger.
 

 
[It really is that good! Mu Yingchen's sword skills are exceptional.]
 

 
[I don’t like that Tong Zhao has so many facets... if only she were like Mu Yingchen in real life...]
 

 
Fans who got to know Tong Zhao through "Heartless Tribulation" felt unsettled.
 

 
In the age of instinctive cinema, characters and actors are inseparable. Fans who got hooked after watching the show wouldn’t unfollow due to a significant gap with the actors; instead, they’d feel reassured by the consistency between on-screen and off-screen personas! But Tong Zhao was an exception—liking her felt like traditional fandom, with a clear separation between the character and the actress.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans quickly jumped in to say they were used to it.
 

 
[Oh, what's the big deal? Fans of Han Zhi's girlfriend are the real zen ones.]
 

 
[I suggest you check out Tong Zhao’s other works; every version of her is quite charming!]
 

 
Fans who loved Tong Zhao’s ethereal, cold demeanor were still quite conflicted.
 

 
This group cared a lot about Zhang Wenshi’s article, where he pointed out that Tong Zhao's performances would be fleeting, never to be seen again...
 

 
Never to be seen again? What should they do?
 

 
Just pay to watch it again!
 

 
Rewatching is basic; some even watched it three or four times.
 

 
However, besides core fans, most were drawn in by the big scenes.
 

 
A film good enough to warrant a rewatch certainly has lasting appeal.
 

 
No matter how jealous peers were, no matter how hard it was to accept, "Heartless Tribulation" still dominated the box office, creating a significant gap with the second and third-place films. Song Wanzhuo's manager stopped mentioning Tong Zhao, instead praising his insight in booking a duet with the box office goddess.
 

 
Wanzhuo felt a bit discontent.
 

 
He understood "Heartless Tribulation" fans all too well.
 

 
Why couldn't Tong Zhao be as enchanting as in "Emperor Ming"?
 

 
He felt the same way.
 

 
Perhaps it was the editing by Shi Qianqiu that triggered this reaction. Bilibili's talented UP creators, unwilling to fall behind Shi, began to take action.
 

 
Other UP creators had to admire Shi Qianqiu; his angle of “Tong Zhao in different works—self-reliant yet vulnerable” generated the highest buzz. Collaborating with other male leads didn’t compare to this theme, and there were plenty of editing opportunities.
 

 
And since it has an ancient backdrop, the hottest pairing is...
 

 
Immortal Master X Imperial Concubine.
# Chapter65
How did these two end up together?
 

 
Viewers who have watched this TV series and the movie may feel puzzled. In "The Legend of Emperor Ming," the favored consort has always ignored same-sex affections. Although part of this is due to the assumption that same-sex individuals in the harem are competitors, it is true that the consort has never shown tenderness towards women.
 

 
Mu Yingchen is a character who is completely the opposite.
 

 
She is exceptionally gentle with girls and shows no interest in men.
 

 
Even when treating her male disciples, her kindness is limited to not drawing her sword...
 

 
In "The Heartless Tribulation," there is a segment questioning Yingchen Fairy about only accepting female disciples, highlighting her obvious favoritism towards them.
 

 
Mu Yingchen coldly replied:
 

 
"Isn't the favoritism that men receive in this world enough? Family businesses, ancestral lines, and achievements are all inherited by men. In the mortal realm, respect is given to the ruler, the father, and the husband. Given that they enjoy so many benefits yet still feel insufficient, they cannot tolerate my favoritism towards women and come to dispute it with the term 'fairness'? My actions do not require outside opinions. If you have anything to say, take it up with my sword."
 

 
The hall fell silent immediately.
 

 
Who would dare take on her sword and then talk about fairness?
 

 
So no one dared to speak.
 

 
If we must talk about the commonalities between the two, it’s that they are both domineering, portrayed by the same actress, and are both female.
 

 
No matter how hard you think about it, you just can’t understand how they got paired together.
 

 
It’s okay not to understand.
 

 
Perhaps those in the know might not get it, but many fans take pride in creating a shipping vibe between two people who had no connection, watching the audience evolve from “Wait, how is this possible?” to “Once I accepted this pairing, it’s actually kind of cute,” and finally to “What is this random pairing? This AE is real!”...
 

 
Among them, the thrill of distorting facts and manipulating hearts is like a god holding great power.
 

 
Once the first shipper video hit the charts, other shippers eagerly followed suit—
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Correct Way to Open the Palace and Immortal Realm”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Girls She Loved Were Fake”
 

 
“[Mu Fei] The Wind Rises”
 

 
It’s like the classic scene of Bucky falling from a train off a cliff, frequently used in Marvel edits; this couple also has a scene that gets recycled over and over—
 

 
Coincidentally, the luxurious palanquin that the female supporting character Li Qiaoqiao rides in "The Heartless Tribulation" shares the same modeling code as the one used for the favored consort in "The Legend of Emperor Ming" when she is brought into the palace. The production team didn’t think much of it; they simply bought a set for the popular data and that was it, which resulted in solid evidence that “this cross-drama couple is real.”
 

 
Thus, with injuries all over and looking utterly disheveled, Mu Yingchen leans against the tree once again, only daring to silently gaze at the magnificent palanquin on the main path, inside of which sits the girl she loves, about to be taken into the imperial palace...
 

 
Meanwhile, the actress playing Li Qiaoqiao, Ding Jiao, tweeted a complaint.
 

 
@DingJiaoV:
 

 
I shouldn’t be inside the palanquin; I should be underneath it.
 

 
[Mu Fei CP Screenshot]
 

 
The comments below are hilarious.
 

 
[Poor sister became a tool/dog head emoji]
 

 
[I’ve really been brainwashed by these edits and have rewatched “The Heartless Tribulation” three times, always wanting to see where the favored consort is...]
 

 
[Mu Fei Szd!!! I recommend everyone to watch “[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears,” the lyrics fit perfectly; it’s so heartbreaking!]
 

 
“[Mu Fei] A Thousand Years of Tears”
 

 
This video topped the Bilibili film and television editing hot list, ranking fourth overall, showing just how many netizens it touched.
 

 
Due to the numerous close-ups of their one-sided conversations, they edited it into a shippy dialogue.
 

 
—You gaze at the horizon, I gaze at your face [Note 1]
 

 
In the masterful editing of the canola flower creator, the favored consort says, “This dance, the person I wanted to perform it for is no longer here.” It’s actually about her regretful sister, the queen, but it was interpreted as referring to Mu Yingchen.
 

 
Mu Yingchen once danced with a sword on the Sword Peak, accompanied by the favored consort playing the guzheng for the emperor.
 

 
When the background music changes, it feels like one person plays the zither while the other dances.
 

 
Favored Consort: “I want the riches of this world.”
 

 
Mu Yingchen: “Wealth and power are nothing but dust.”
 

 
There’s a close-up of Mu Yingchen holding her sword, her cold voice stating, “My golden core has been shattered, and my spiritual power is nearly depleted; today is my day to die.”
 

 
“I’ve come to seek justice for myself, to settle the past grievances.”
 

 
After saying this, she strikes down with her sword.
 

 
This section cuts from some unfortunate period drama where the palace gets destroyed.
 

 
Next is the scene where the favored consort coughs up blood and dies in the emperor's embrace.
 

 
A close-up of Mu Yingchen's astonished expression follows.
 

 
A tear falls from the favored consort’s eye, sliding down her delicate cheek.
 

 
—Your tears are not the only thing teetering on the edge.
 

 
—The mocking wind sings a farewell. [Note 2]
 

 
Here begins a series of hard cuts showcasing memories, accompanied by suggestive lines that could easily confuse viewers who haven't seen the original version:
 

 
Favored Consort: “The first time I saw her, I thought to myself, how could there be such a woman in the world? She is beautiful and noble, has a good background, and the man she marries is…” Her voice trails off, a hint of mockery evident in her tone.
 

 
It transitions to Mu Yingchen’s debut at the Dao Companion Ceremony, dressed in white, untainted by dust.
 

 
The creator who used “A Thousand Years of Tears” as background music has a dirty mind. At the end, they splice in the “Sea King Kill” along with the real-life “Tong Zhao,” crafting a yuri version of their reunion a thousand years later. This edit is much easier since Tong Zhao has recently become popular due to Mu Yingchen’s role, and during promotional events, she would pose with a cold expression that matched everyone’s imagination, thus…
 

 
Cold and aloof actress X manipulative green tea, modern CP is now a thing.
 

 
“The rise of the Mu Fei CP, and the biggest victim should be my brother, Wan Zhuo.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really has it hard.
 

 
He was dragged out to be beaten down again.
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a duet for the New Year’s Eve party? Considering the timing, it was about right, so he posted on Weibo again, cueing Tong Zhao. The tone was very businesslike, almost bureaucratic, clearly written by his agent. However, the comments section completely backfired.
 

 
[Break up my Mu Fei CP, the dog emperor, come out and face death!]
 

 
[But I want to see the consort and Mu Yingchen sing love songs together. How about you take responsibility for playing the guzheng, Your Majesty?]
 

 
This comment immediately sparked a rebuttal from Wanzhuo's fans: [No way, our brother can only play the electric guitar. Can Yingchen rock out?]
 

 
Although Tong Zhao and Song Wanzhuo had a very casual friendship, they maintained ongoing collaborations in public.
 

 
Their relationship was known to be pretty good, and when others commented on it like this, fans would inevitably start arguing.
 

 
The new generation of young stars were all avid surfers on the internet, and Song Wanzhuo was no exception. He loved browsing Bilibili to watch video edits. During the middle of “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” the romantic plot between the dog emperor and the favored consort sparked a wave of videos, and he had saved a special compilation of moments with his goddess in his favorites.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo complained to Tong Zhao on WeChat: [Why am I the dog emperor again? I clearly pamper you!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Because in the fan edits, you killed the favored consort.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was taken aback: [Why would I kill my beloved consort?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The plot needs a villain; just accept your fate.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [I must be the most resentful person regarding this CP in the world.]
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and wanted to say, “No, you’re not.”
 

 
The most resentful person in her mind was—
 

 
Concubine Chen: [Help! Spare me, even if all the men in the world die, I will never have the thought of being with her!]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [If I have committed any offenses, the palace rules would punish me, not let me see this kind of thing.]
 

 
Concubine Chen’s intense output: [Even if I were paired with He Shun, at least that would make sense. Have we ever appeared together? It’s impossible. Let go of that thought; the person edited in is not me at all.]
 

 
Duan Ge (brother) accurately strikes: [You guys are serious.]
 

 
[Back in the palace, could the palace rules do anything to you?] Lu Yingchen said coolly, with a tone full of exhaustion from seeing the fickleness of the world: [It’s quite nice; finally, there’s something that can sanction you, the calamity-bringing concubine.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I really enjoy watching these videos. I didn’t expect that we could have this side in the eyes of the audience. They all praise your portrayal of Mu Yingchen as the most ethereal cultivator! In “The Legend of the Ming Emperor,” you were a flower of wealth and nobility, but in “The Heartless Tribulation,” you have that disenchanted look that seems above the mundane.]
 

 
Concubine Chen: [What disenchanted look? I see her as a retired security guard.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...Pfft.”
 

 
“What’s wrong?” The manager, who was discussing the variety show details with Tong Zhao, looked over with concern as she suddenly burst into laughter.
 

 
Tong Zhao covered her mouth with her hand and pulled out a versatile reply: “I just thought of something happy.”
 

 
She really couldn’t help it; she wanted to laugh out loud.
 

 
“Seeing you laugh makes me happy too,” Sister Chu said. “Come and take a look at the flying guest spoilers prepared by the production team.”
 

 
@OneLifeSurvivor:
 

 
#OneLifeSurvivor# Guess who the flying guest is for the next episode.
 

 
[Silhouette]
 

 
The figure in the silhouette is tall, and the long sword at their waist is a recognizable feature.
 

 
At first, no one recognized it as Tong Zhao; they didn't dare to guess it was her. She has been quite popular lately. Would she really come to this kind of grueling variety show? It seemed unnecessary for her to participate; it would be much more comfortable to join lighthearted shows filled with food, drink, and entertainment while still maintaining her fanbase.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans often say that their idol works too hard and hope her manager can arrange some easier gigs for her.
 

 
“Stop scheduling activities that involve losing limbs or digging for bullets all the time.”
 

 
The manager felt quite wronged.
 

 
After the spoiler tweet was posted for a while, some sharp-eyed netizens thought the silhouette looked familiar. They compared it with screenshots from "The Heartless Tribulation," and surprisingly, they lined up perfectly. This netizen posted the comparison in the comments, and it was quickly shared on forums. Other netizens were skeptical but also felt there was some logic to it—
 

 
[Not to mention, this variety show really has that girl’s style.]
 

 
[Fan: My heart aches for my sister QAQ. Tong Zhao: Is there any other way to torture me? Hurry up.]
 

 
[#The last female celebrity who doesn't need fans to feel sorry for her#]
 

 
[What is she doing on this variety show? If she goes, is there still a way for others to survive?]
 

 
"In One Life Survives," there are twenty contestants each episode.
 

 
They form groups of four and must survive on a deserted island for fifteen days. They face not only the challenges of hunger and thirst but also the potential dangers from wild animals. The production team will periodically drop limited supplies to encourage conflict and competition among the teams, leading to mutual elimination.
 

 
It’s essentially a real-life, team-based version of PUBG.
 

 
If a guest is attacked by a beast, there will be a struggle period. If there are no teammates to defeat the beast or escape successfully, the system will directly determine them as dead, without any additional physical pain or gruesome scenes of being bitten.
 

 
The firearms issued have real lethal force when hitting wild animals, but when they hit other contestants, they are simply paintballs. Depending on the area hit, there will be corresponding negative effects—for example, if a contestant is hit in the knee by a paintball, they won’t feel any pain aside from a slight jolt, but they will be deemed hit and thus unable to move that leg.
 

 
Therefore, aiming for the legs to incapacitate them is a viable strategy in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
After the holographic technology matured, this type of survival variety show sprang up like mushrooms after rain.
 

 
However, there aren't many stars willing to participate, especially idols.
 

 
Those who are delicate and precious will get teary-eyed with just a slight bump; if they endure even a little hardship, they’ll buy marketing campaigns to maintain their image. Participating in such a variety show would be self-inflicted suffering and ruin their reputation. Fans also don’t want to see them suffer, so this type of show is generally reserved for tough-guy male stars, who can come in, dominate the competition, and immediately gain a large male audience's favor.
 

 
Long Jue, the top rising star, became an instant sensation in "In One Life Survives."
 

 
Originally a young man working on a construction site while dealing with family debt, Long Jue had trained in martial arts before his family fell on hard times. He stepped in at the last minute for a missing contestant due to illness. His ability to endure hardship and fight was fully displayed on the show, particularly in a scene where he was wearing a black tank top, washing off sweat and blood under a waterfall, which left countless viewers breathless.
 

 
His chest and biceps were incredibly impressive.
 

 
When he dove into the water and raised his head, slicking his hair back, his handsome and strong face caught the audience's attention, revealing him as a hidden gem. After the show ended, he was immediately signed by an entertainment company, and his experience on "In One Life Survives" made him successful during auditions for tough-guy roles.
 

 
[Those who got into "Countdown 72 Hours" are really looking forward to seeing Tong Zhao's strong "true self" again.]
 

 
[72 Hours 1]
 

 
Tong Zhao's strong subconscious is evident in "Countdown 72 Hours."
 

 
Initially, netizens were quite surprised that a rising female star would be willing to participate in a survival variety show. As discussions went on, they began to feel excited about it, though there were also male users on a male-dominated forum who were openly mocking her—
 

 
“Seriously, are there really female stars who think they can thrive in a survival variety show?”
 

 
“Friendly reminder: in a survival variety show, no one gets special treatment like in movies.”
 

 
“Click to see confident comments from Chinese female fans.”
 

 
Since her debut, Tong Zhao has had a group of male haters.
 

 
Her PR team and manager analyzed that it's mostly born from love turning to hate.
 

 
The character she portrayed, the imperial concubine, can be considered a heartthrob killer, attracting a significant number of male fans. Many on that forum refer to her as their wife, believing that having her makes them feel like emperors. Given that the survival genre often depicts a character's journey from being a newcomer to facing life-changing experiences...
 

 
Tong Zhao has chosen to play Feng Yanqi.
 

 
Her portrayal of a cold and fierce woman shattered some male fans' delicate hearts.
 

 
At first, they criticized her manager for taking on too many roles.
 

 
But when they realized Tong Zhao was willingly accepting these roles, they felt she wasn't listening to advice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's patriarchal mindset reflects the sentiments of many men—
 

 
You have to listen to me; I understand a lot, and I am the truth of the world. If you don’t listen to me, something bad will happen.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t run into trouble; instead, everything she acted in became a hit, and her new film ‘Heartless Tribulation’ had a great box office success, showcasing a cold demeanor that didn’t rely on men.
 

 
This instantly triggered those male fans, turning them into die-hard haters, hoping she would fail.
 

 
Seeing her take on a highly challenging role in the male-dominated survival variety show In ‘One Life Survives’, they immediately got excited. On one hand, they felt their masculinity was being insulted, while on the other, they were relieved that she dared to take on anything, giving them a chance to mock her.
 

 
"Rational Discussion: What Gave Tong Zhao the Confidence to Venture into Survival Variety Shows?"
 

 
Original poster:
 

 
“From randomly taking on post-apocalyptic films to hitting it big, someone has tasted the sweet fruit of a fierce woman image. After listening to her fans' uncritical praise, she feels like she can take on five at once, forgetting how she got here—wasn’t it by flattering men as the imperial concubine?
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao makes me think of those soft support girls I encounter when I’m playing ranked matches...
 

 
Getting carried to diamond rank by the wild king brother and occasionally winning MVP, they start to think they’re really at that level.
 

 
It’s not that I’m misogynistic; let’s let the data speak.
 

 
Survival variety shows generally lack female guests; even if they go, they’re just dragging everyone down. Tong Zhao’s fans shouldn’t be too quick to curse me. Your sister has such a beautiful face; do you really want to see her ruin her image? Isn’t it better for her to be a beautiful little fairy or a little princess? She could do great in shows like ‘Sea King Kill’.”
 

 
The provocative original post, which wore the guise of a rational discussion, quickly became a hot thread that represented the mainstream voice of this forum.
 

 
At first glance, it seemed to make a lot of sense.
 

 
Tong Zhao is indeed beautiful, and some fans hope she maintains a delicate and beautiful image, participating in leisurely and fun variety shows.
 

 
The original poster felt that their comments were quite reasonable.
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans, unable to accept this, were labeled as mindless defenders who couldn’t grasp the situation.
 

 
Data analysis also showed that after Tong Zhao took on ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, the male percentage in her fan base slightly decreased.
 

 
However, some male users held a different opinion: “I admire Tong Zhao for being willing to take on various challenging roles, which is why I became her fan. Why do you insist on demanding that an independent and strong woman fit your idea of a delicate flower?”
 

 
The same argument had different responses in different places.
 

 
On Weibo, Tong Zhao, who severed her father-daughter relationship, was met with sympathy from netizens.
 

 
The mainstream opinion felt she was strong, unaffected by her weak mother, and impressively independent.
 

 
On the cat forum, however, this was seen as a black mark against her.
 

 
There were plenty of posts expressing that if their daughter were a fan of Tong Zhao, they would break her legs to stop her from emulating an idol who easily disowns her father like an ungrateful wolf.
 

 
Bias often shapes perception; one's position determines their thoughts.
 

 
This topic intensified, fueled by some who wanted to bring Tong Zhao down, creating a spectacle for their competitors while causing more trouble, spreading to Weibo.
 

 
They claimed that fans were resisting Tong Zhao appearing on ‘In One Life Survives’.
 

 
The fans looked completely bewildered.
 

 
They immediately went to check the original post that was shared and felt even more wronged than Dou E.
 

 
[... We don't want Zhao Zhao to suffer, but we never thought of her like that!]
 

 
[Please, straight male cancer, if you can’t handle a female actress being tough, don’t drag us into it, okay?]
 

 
[I’m a male fan, and I feel really wronged; I suggest removing this brain-dead person from the male ranks.]
 

 
[Ugh, I can’t take it. I really hope Tong Zhao survives until the end and slaps those self-confident boys in the face.]
 

 
Normal male fans felt unjustly treated and couldn’t understand this group’s mindset.
 

 
In ‘Countdown 72 Hours’, Tong Zhao was indeed fierce, yet she remained beautiful; when she was shooting with the gun, she was undeniably sexy—especially for otaku who loved mobile games like ‘Girls' Frontline’, who all referred to her as the gun girl of their dreams, feeling as if she had stepped out of the 2D world as a Valkyrie.
 

 
Different strokes for different folks.
 

 
But these haters didn’t feel the same way; they adored Tong Zhao’s performance in ‘Emperor Ming’ and believed she had gone astray, criticizing her for her own good. Couldn’t the fans see how many boyfriend fans she had when she performed in ‘Emperor Ming’?
 

 
For these haters, seeing Tong Zhao was like watching their delicate wives go to work as a strong woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were infuriated, but looking at the data…
 

 
It seemed that survival variety shows really had very few female guests!
 

 
And even fewer had outstanding performances.
 

 
However, some fans countered with solid arguments—
 

 
Although the physical fitness of female guests may be lacking, their emotional stability is quite high, unlike what some male netizens say about them easily breaking down. They also move very cautiously and carefully. There was a winning team that managed to survive because one female guest remembered to erase their traces in the jungle.
 

 
Haters:
 

 
[Oh, so your sister plans to survive by avoiding confrontation?]
 

 
[Then we’re not wrong; she might as well go to a relaxing variety show where she can shine. If she spends the whole time avoiding confrontation without getting a single shot, isn’t that just a waste of time? How long is a female actor’s golden period? Isn’t it a waste for her to spend it avoiding confrontation like a coward?]
 

 
...
 

 
It seems there’s some truth to that.
 

 
Some more influential fan leaders advised fans not to get too worked up. If someone made a claim like, “Tong Zhao will lead the team to victory in the variety show,” and a screenshot was taken by someone with ill intentions, only for her not to deliver in the end, that would be quite embarrassing.
 

 
Isn’t it unfair to raise expectations for sister?
 

 
Don’t give the haters attention; let them go crazy. Zhao Zhao is a woman they can never have.
 

 
With such a big uproar, Tong Zhao naturally knew about it.
 

 
The production team was thrilled; the natural buzz surrounding her made other variety shows that didn’t invite Tong Zhao jealous. Some with darker minds were already hoping she wouldn’t perform as well as the haters claimed.
 

 
The female journalist humorously commented: “Is this the power of the national disaster beauty? Little Chen should reflect on this.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke more harshly than the fans defending Tong Zhao against the haters: “All I can say is that there have always been such fools in every era. They don’t consider that if it were an era of imperial authority, my beauty would be something they could only covet. Everyone thinks they could be the emperor; I should be their beloved concubine. But if we were to dream back to ancient times, their only chance to interact with me would be to enter the palace as eunuchs.”
 

 
Tong Zhao found it hilarious and was in a great mood.
 

 
No one could ruin her mindset; it was all related to her.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Alright, don’t be upset. I’ll find a way to support you.”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “I’m not upset; men can’t get to me. The only one who can truly anger me is that cultivator.”
 

 
Female journalist: “Do you know how many people are going to comment ‘I’m shipping this’ after you say that?”
 

 
With Duan Ge backing her up, Concubine Chen was happy again.
 

 
Duan Ge: “As long as you’re not angry, that’s good. But I’m a little upset.”
 

 
Online, some of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t stand the backlash and secretly sent her encouraging messages in private and comments, hoping she could lead her teammates to victory and slap the haters in the face. In situations like this, the best response is not to engage, and the fans understood that.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s response shattered their hopes—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
“I’m sorry, but it’s impossible to lead my teammates to victory in #OneSurvives#.”
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[Why is sister saying such pessimistic things????]
 

 
Just as the haters were about to celebrate, the production team of “One Survives” retweeted.
 

 
@OneSurvives v:
 

 
“Because @Sister Tong Zhao is serving as the hunter for this episode of survival!”
 

 
An external trial officer for a group of twenty.
 

 
Unlike other teams that can muddle through to victory, the hunter's only winning condition is to eliminate everyone. They have no teammates, and for every person they eliminate, they receive supplies for one day. Theoretically, there’s no need to search for food; they only need to find people.
 

 
Lead teammates to victory?
 

 
Impossible, because Tong Zhao has no teammates.
 

 
Both the haters and the fans were stunned.
# Chapter66
“Did you hear that Tong Zhao is coming? Is it true?”
 

 
“It’s true; it’s already officially announced.”
 

 
“I heard she was only supposed to come for two days, but then it changed. Who knows what she’s after.”
 

 
“Then we have to help her out, right?”
 

 
At the filming site of ‘OneLifeSurvivor’, three ordinary guests huddled in a corner, discussing quietly.
 

 
Even with a 24-hour survival show, there’s still some room for behind-the-scenes manipulation.
 

 
It’s just much less than traditional variety shows.
 

 
In survival-type shows, if a certain guest's physical capabilities are enhanced—like when everyone is getting rained on and drinking raw water—only that guest won’t suffer from headaches or fevers. Or if the same food supplies are available, one specific guest might feel fuller than the others, giving them an invisible advantage.
 

 
However, the audience for survival shows seeks a sense of realism, so such behind-the-scenes interference is rare...
 

 
Or rather, it’s very well-kept secret, with few leaks.
 

 
“Who knows?”
 

 
When Tong Zhao was mentioned, the two shrugged dismissively, and one added, “Director Chen wouldn’t dare to go too far. If the complaint rate exceeds 40%, the backend data has to be made public. The show’s ratings are good; why would they ruin their reputation for a publicity-seeking female star?”
 

 
The remaining person looked a bit embarrassed: “I actually like Tong Zhao, so don’t say that about her.”
 

 
“Why do you like her? Is she going to ruin your own rice bowl?”
 

 
...
 

 
As soon as the words left their mouths, Director Chen walked in through the door.
 

 
He was no longer the aloof figure he usually presented to his subordinates; instead, he wore a smile on his face. “I can’t feel at ease for even a moment when I don’t see anyone.”
 

 
Walking beside Director Chen was a tall, slender woman.
 

 
“I’ve always been on time.”
 

 
Her voice was a bit cold. Dressed in sporty casual clothes with sneakers and a baseball cap, she wore an outfit that, while suitable for sweating it out on the sports field and not showing off her figure, made it clear that she had model-like proportions with her long legs. Even if she wore a burlap sack, she could easily be ready to strut down a runway.
 

 
When people see a good figure, they can’t help but imagine she must be beautiful.
 

 
When she took off her black cat-ear hat, the other guests couldn’t help but have their hearts skip a beat.
 

 
It was really Tong Zhao!
 

 
They had known for a while that a very beautiful female star would be coming today—the recent splash screen advertisement on Weibo was for ‘Heartless Tribulation’, and with Tong Zhao’s rising popularity, anyone in the film industry, even a temporary actor, couldn’t possibly have not heard of her or seen her photos.
 

 
These guests, who often frequented the film city, had long been accustomed to handsome men and beautiful women.
 

 
To stand out among so many attractive faces, Tong Zhao’s looks had to be remarkable.
 

 
The guests who had been whispering and speaking dismissively about her fell silent in unison, turning their attention to her with respect.
 

 
The smile at the corners of her lips was faint.
 

 
Director Chen wanted to say something else to her but couldn’t think of a topic, so he moved aside to put on the protective gear provided on-site—knee pads, elbow protectors, and fingerless gloves.
 

 
The film city, primarily focused on survival variety shows, was built on the outskirts, encompassing a large area.
 

 
This setup was intended to ensure that when the guests took breaks from the cabin, there wouldn't be a significant environmental contrast that could cause psychological discrepancies. After waking up in the cabin, they would still see green mountains and clear waters outside their dormitory windows, accompanied by the sounds of birds and the fragrance of flowers. The location rented for ‘One Life Survivor’ included a site for artificial off-road challenges, where a warm-up activity would be conducted before filming, allowing the audience to observe the physical fitness levels of the guests in real life.
 

 
There was no way to alter the backend data in reality!
 

 
Director Chen really dared to go this far.
 

 
The crowd couldn't help but steal a few more glances at Tong Zhao.
 

 
After she skillfully donned the protective gear, she began to stretch and warm up in place.
 

 
"She looks pretty serious."
 

 
Guest No. 7 muttered.
 

 
"Maybe she really has some skills; otherwise, why would she dare to come? If she shows off a bit during the warm-up, it would make sense to alter the data later," another seasoned guest, often seen on survival variety shows, whispered. Her black knee pads accentuated her long legs, which looked snow-white and delicate, making him swallow hard.
 

 
While the other guests quietly gossiped about Tong Zhao, she was completely oblivious.
 

 
After all, the noise in her mind was loud enough.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “There are so many men here!”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Are you happy?”
 

 
Lu Yingchen: “I wake up in a place like this…”
 

 
Lu Yingchen couldn't hide his disgust and wanted to clear the place with a single sword stroke.
 

 
“Happy my ass! It’s infuriating! I shouldn’t have come to this place; it’s an insult to my eyes,”
 
Concubine Chen said, fanning herself with a peacock-feather fan, covering half of her beautiful face. “Let me reiterate, I only accept the best men in the world. Not just any good, definitely not mediocre—only the best will do.”
 

 
Concubine Chen spoke with an arrogance born from being spoiled.
 

 
She wasn’t targeting anyone in particular; she considered all the men present to be trash.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted Lu Yingchen: “Why don’t you rest a bit longer? Duan Ge (brother) will cover for you here.”
 

 
They had previously considered who should participate in the survival variety show.
 

 
After all, Lu Yingchen’s outdoor survival skills were quite strong; she had lived in the jungle for a long time before restoring her cultivation, much like a monk in training. She had done all sorts of exaggerated things often seen in anime, like meditating under a waterfall and challenging wild black bears—her ethereal aura had come later.
 

 
If she lacked capability, how could she remain untarnished?
 

 
But later, upon looking up the guests for the survival show, Tong Zhao knew that there would be many men. She was aware that Lu Yingchen didn’t like this kind of environment. Even if she said she could handle it, it didn’t matter; she wouldn’t be willing to.
 

 
If she didn’t cherish her own character, who would cherish it for her?
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been the one who valued herself the most.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t speak. She had been unhappy ever since the negative comments about Lu Yingchen started circulating online.
 

 
One, she felt pity for Concubine Chen being coveted by a group of lowly people.
 

 
Thinking about it, the haters who favor Concubine Chen and resist Tong Zhao's participation in other roles are really trying to sow discord between their different personalities. To put it bluntly, it’s like demanding that a girlfriend or daughter be virtuous and gentle, molding them into what they want like clay, erasing any aspect they dislike.
 

 
They love her for being delicate and charming but hate her for being strong and fierce.
 

 
And they never consider that both the delicate and the strong sides are just facets of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Do they want Tong Zhao to erase some of her traits just to please them?
 

 
That's impossible. Not only will she not give them the satisfaction, but she will also continue to walk her own path.
 

 
Additionally, due to being immersed in a war-torn apocalypse, Duan Ge's hostility is heavier than that of other personalities, and it’s impossible for her to vent her anger at her sisters during this survival variety show. Tong Zhao agreed to change her participation from two days to one episode for this reason—both the production team and she felt they were leveraging each other, achieving a win-win situation.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Well, I’m going to sleep now. Wake me up when you’re done having fun with the body.”
 

 
Duan Ge chuckled lightly and replied, “Okay.”
 

 
……
 

 
"One Life Survivor" is a live-streamed variety show.
 

 
Similar to "Countdown 72 Hours," it has both post-edited versions and 24-hour live broadcasts.
 

 
The warm-up activity consists of a four-person group completing an obstacle course challenge.
 

 
The first task is a basic 1,000-meter run on grass, followed by climbing an artificial rock wall, a short hurdle race, crossing an artificial lake, completing a rope net climb, and then facing various minor challenges, finishing with a 200-meter swim…
 

 
The shorter the time it takes to complete, the better the score.
 

 
Of course, if someone can’t finish, there’s no need to force themselves; they can withdraw partway and still participate in subsequent segments of the variety show.
 

 
The show itself has decent popularity, and with Tong Zhao joining this episode, the viewership for the warm-up activities has already reached six figures and is continuing to rise. This is also why the show has chosen to have Tong Zhao make her appearance last… They’re worried that once she completes her challenge, the audience will leave, so they’re keeping her as a highlight to hold the viewers' attention.
 

 
[Where’s Tong Zhao? When is she coming out? I came to see her.]
 

 
[Why hasn’t she shown up yet?]
 

 
[I suggest we fast-forward to Tong Zhao’s appearance!!!]
 

 
[Wow, there are really so few female guests, I’m a bit worried about Zhao Zhao QAQ]
 

 
The frequency data of keywords in the comments clearly demonstrates Tong Zhao's commercial value.
 

 
Regardless of the evaluations, netizens are simply curious about her.
 

 
Actors often repeat the same type of roles, just like an author who only writes one genre. While this can stabilize their fan base and provide a steady income, it can also lead to fatigue—it's difficult to keep all audiences consistently engaged in the same tone over a long period. However, as long as they handle this well, they can earn significant wealth.
 

 
Tong Zhao changes her style with every film she makes; some people criticize her for being too unconventional, but one has to admit that this is also a way to maintain freshness.
 

 
……
 

 
At this moment, the crew member came over to call her: “Sister Zhao, it’s almost your turn.”
 

 
The host smiled at the camera and encouraged Tong Zhao:
 

 
“If you feel like you can’t hold on anymore, you can immediately press the emergency button on your watch, and a medical team will come to take you for a rest. Remember to know your limits, okay, miss?”
 

 
Prior to this, he had added Tong Zhao on WeChat and greeted her, saying he would make some provocative comments for the sake of the show’s effect.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood immediately.
 

 
Of course, the production team was racking their brains for explosive moments, and the host was just a worker; she wouldn’t make things difficult for him. She simply replied that she understood and told him to say whatever he wanted, but her fans might go after him, so he had to be careful.
 

 
[If the host can’t speak properly, he should just shut up.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao's fans are getting anxious? Advising her to know her limits is for her own good? Got it, some people’s fans are all elementary school kids who don’t understand kind advice.]
 

 
[Even though I think what the host said was unpleasant, I also hope the sister knows her limits. There are male guests ahead who are exhausted and can’t complete the tasks; there’s no need to push herself...]
 

 
The comments were buzzing, and a debate erupted.
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her eyelids and glanced at him.
 

 
That dark and silent glance cast a chilling and deadly aura over her beautifully shaped eyes.
 

 
The host's smiling face froze.
 

 
Humans are all part of the same species, yet there are a hundred different types. A student standing in front of their teacher will behave obediently under a gaze, while a fugitive will have their heart race at just a glance from someone in a police uniform. There is a theory of mutual suppression between people; herbivores will never get to eat meat in their lifetimes. Just putting on a wolf's skin won’t change that.
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really that intimidating?
 

 
The host felt dazed by her gaze, like a noisy sheep being caught by a disgruntled tiger ready to bite into its carotid artery, contemplating whether to give it a quick end.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
Duan Ge, a beat behind, flipped through Tong Zhao's memories to find their WeChat chat records, remembering that this person was only speaking oddly for work purposes…
 

 
The fierce aura that seemed to be ready to devour someone suddenly froze.
 

 
It was as if the sharp teeth of a wild beast were pressing against her skin but had stopped their advance.
 

 
The eyes that had been shrouded in hostility cleared slightly, as if the clouds had parted.
 

 
“No need.”
 

 
These three words were spoken with the same coldness as “Get lost and stop bothering me.”
 

 
“Okay, okay! Good luck, miss!”
 

 
The host, who had originally prepared a barrage of strange remarks, dared not utter another word and obediently retreated.
 

 
The challenge involved completing the obstacle course in groups of four, and the first five groups had already finished.
 

 
The best time was 10 minutes and 07 seconds, achieved by a male guest, number 16, who usually trained in long-distance running and looked like a potential star athlete.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the final contestant, and there would be solo camera shots of her throughout.
 

 
Several guests who dreamed of standing out in the survival variety show and joining the ranks of celebrities cast envious and jealous glances at her as she stood at the starting line. The various complex gazes seemed to pierce into her, but unfortunately, she stood too far forward for them to look her in the eye—
 

 
And Duan Ge would never look back.
 

 
“Get in position,”
 

 
“Ready—”
 

 
[Tong Zhao, go!]
 

 
[That figure is incredible! When she crouches in the starting position, her legs have muscle! How come I never noticed this before? She looks so good; I want to be squeezed to death by her thighs.] After this comment was posted, the fan who clicked on it angrily found out it was from a girl, so it was all good.
 

 
As the gun fired, her slender figure shot out like an arrow.
 

 
This body was a bit more delicate than the one Duan Ge used during the apocalypse, but Tong Zhao had consistently practiced her cultivation techniques since returning, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. This not only made her skin and overall condition nearly perfect but also strengthened her physique. She didn’t pursue a fragile “ideal body”; she had all the muscles she needed, and now was the time to put them to use.
 

 
If it came down to physical ability, Tong Zhao’s body was not much worse than that of a male athlete.
 

 
Duan Ge was also a good runner.
 

 
She understood exactly when to sprint in a kilometer, when to pace herself, and how to regulate her breathing.
 

 
This wasn’t something learned from a gym teacher.
 

 
It was experience gained from being chased by zombies; different paths led to the same destination.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team could be considered humane.
 

 
The afternoon sun was abundant, not scorching enough to make one feel dizzy. The light fell on Duan Ge as she ran on the track, like a layer of golden powder laid over her fair skin, dazzling to the eyes. This scene put many of her fans at ease.
 

 
A strong sister is certainly impressive.
 

 
However, beauty fans are quite real; they love that face and hope their idol looks beautiful in everything she does. They fear seeing her unflattering moments and unfollowing her—this group is common and is like those online who shout, “You can trick me with a fake photo, but please don’t scare me with a real selfie.”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao looking so beautiful during high-intensity exercise reassured her beauty fans!
 

 
[Mom asked why my screen is wet.]
 

 
[? GHS?]
 

 
[It's because I couldn't help but lick the screen when I saw the beautiful sister!]
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t think about the effect of the show.
 

 
She had never been a star; at most, she would remember that she was an artist now and should pay attention to her image. But deliberately running beautifully? That was impossible. Her thinking was very practical; the reason she looked good was simply that she was too comfortable and effortless.
 

 
This cross-country challenge was not just a test of physical ability but also the difficulty of switching between various activities.
 

 
One moment she had to run, the next she had to climb a wall, then hurdle, and then swim...
 

 
But for someone who had survived in the apocalypse, wasn’t this quite normal?
 

 
She didn’t even have to turn back to shoot zombies.
 

 
Watching Duan Ge complete the challenge, it was hard for not just the onlookers but even her fans to feel anxious.
 

 
They had initially been quite worried about her.
 

 
As a result, after watching for a while, they completely forgot their nerves and started admiring her beauty.
 

 
A significant portion of her fans had a strong admiration for strength. Tong Zhao's fanbase mainly consisted of career-oriented supporters, which was even more of a group that idolized strength. Watching their sister complete the challenge effortlessly and gracefully filled them with pride.
 

 
"Whoosh!"
 

 
When Duan Ge reached the finish line, the recorded completion time on screen was 10 minutes and 17 seconds.
 

 
That was only 10 seconds slower than the first place.
 

 
That was already incredible.
 

 
After all, the physical differences between men and women are objective and not discriminatory. Sports exams have different standards for men and women; if a unified standard were applied, it would be a form of invisible discrimination.
 

 
After swimming the two hundred meters, Duan Ge pressed her hands against the edge of the pool, pushing her upper body out of the water.
 

 
To facilitate movement, she had her hair tied up in a high ponytail today, which now hung down her back, wet and resembling a soft whip. Duan Ge was dressed quite conservatively and knew she would be entering the water, so she wore materials that wouldn’t become transparent when wet, showcasing the elegant lines of her shoulder blades. She looked like a dragon leaping from the surface of the water, embodying the cold and noble dragon maiden imagined by the people of China.
 

 
[...I’m dead. Thank you, production team, for arranging the wet segment!]
 

 
[Someone is desperately requesting Tong Zhao to play the princess of the Dragon Palace in the East Sea.]
 

 
[Princess? This is clearly a queen!]
 

 
This was the beauty fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Onlookers, especially those who loved survival variety shows, were shocked by Tong Zhao's performance.
 

 
[Does looks matter? The real issue is that Tong Zhao’s speed is incredible!]
 

 
[Is this a river raccoon? This is clearly not a river raccoon! Can her muscle mass support such intense exercise?]
 

 
[...Shocking my entire gym.]
 

 
Some stubborn individuals insisted on recording this segment to time it with their own stopwatch, refusing to believe that Tong Zhao was that fast. Those less adamant began to make jokes—previously, Tong Zhao had been jokingly suggested by netizens to get her brain checked due to her unique subconscious; this time, it seemed like she needed a full physical examination as well.
 

 
What others thought didn’t concern Duan Ge, nor did she have any interest in knowing.
 

 
After leaving the swimming pool, an assistant immediately draped a towel over her shoulders and handed her a hot drink.
 

 
"Thank you."
 

 
Duan Ge turned and smiled at the young assistant.
 

 
She was as fierce with the male host as she was gentle with the female assistant.
 

 
"You're too polite, Sister Zhao."
 

 
The assistant quickly waved her hand, blushing as she stayed by Duan Ge's side, waiting for her to finish drinking before collecting the thermos cup. She didn’t understand what was happening; despite working with Tong Zhao every day, she found her especially charming at that moment. Just a simple thank-you made her heart race.
 

 
What’s going on?!
 

 
She was straight!
 

 
The assistant strongly reminded herself.
 

 
The assistant's racing heart wasn't an isolated phenomenon; nearly 70% of the comments in the live chat mentioned that they were charmed, with the remaining 30% being male viewers who were drawn in. Some had even started researching how to work alongside Tong Zhao, thinking that they could also fetch water and hand over towels! They wanted to hear their sister say thank you in person!
 

 
The other guests at the event had long since collapsed from exhaustion after completing the challenge.
 

 
Even if they couldn't lie down to rest immediately, most were doing gentle exercises to bring their heart rate and blood pressure back to normal levels.
 

 
The performance of other competitors during the guests’ commentary was also a major highlight of the show, so there was a huge screen on site displaying the live footage.
 

 
The contestants, who had originally been chatting aimlessly, all raised their heads to look at the big screen as Tong Zhao began her challenge.
 

 
At first, their curiosity was mixed with malice.
 

 
But the more they watched, the more they couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Tong Zhao might not be the fastest, but she definitely ran the most gracefully.
 

 
Everyone found it hard to believe that she could run so effortlessly, especially since they had all just completed challenges that they knew were exhausting—while they had anticipated that the tests would challenge their stamina, they had not expected to feel completely spent afterward.
 

 
And Tong Zhao was even able to manage her expressions!?
 

 
What incredible professionalism!
 

 
“Wow, is she even human?”
 

 
“Hey, Lao Song, stop drinking water and look at the screen…”
 

 
In the rest area, all the guests instinctively started talking about the same person, their eyes glued to the screen showing the final challenger. When she completed her challenge, the time record flashed on the screen in exaggerated effects, accompanied by sound effects, and they all fell silent.
 

 
When the host asked the other guests for their thoughts, surprisingly, there were very few malicious comments.
 

 
They were stunned.
 

 
Host: “Now that you've seen Tong Zhao’s preliminary challenge, do you feel confident about being her opponent?”
 

 
The male guest answered instantly: “No.”
 

 
“Ah? Why not?”
 

 
“I feel like she could take me out without any expression.”
 

 
The host also asked the female guest who had given up midway and slowly completed the challenge. She replied in a standard manner, “Tong Zhao is much better than me. It’s a pity that she’s in the hunter role; otherwise, I would really want to be her teammate.”
 

 
This sentiment echoed the thoughts of most people.
 

 
After all, the winning team would receive extra bonuses, and they would have a greater chance of being favored by the production team for future survival variety shows.
 

 
No one mentioned the idea of manipulating the data anymore.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's current abilities, if they were to manipulate it again, she would have to be a Super Saiyan, right?
 

 
The preliminary event came to a successful conclusion, and the top three would receive a mysterious reward to aid in their survival on the show.
 

 
The first-place male guest looked at Duan Ge with a complex expression.
 

 
He was only ten seconds behind the young lady, and suddenly, the first-place spot didn’t seem so appealing.
 

 
“What did you say???"
 

 
After the modeling team leader ran over to Director Chen and said a few words, Director Chen’s expression changed dramatically.
 

 
Duan Ge was sitting close enough to hear their conversation clearly.
 

 
The map for each episode of ‘One Life Survivor’ would change, and the planned deserted island map had a bug that couldn’t be fixed quickly: “How could it not be fixable? If there’s a bug, just fix it!”
 

 
“No, that bug is a special kind; identifying it will take a lot of time.”
 

 
Duan Ge was stretching when Han Zhi’s sigh echoed in her mind: [Why does something go wrong every time we do a variety show?]
 

 
Last time during ‘Sea King Killer’, there was an unexpected incident that forced him to step in at the last minute.
 

 
It was impossible to delay the shoot, and killing the director wouldn’t solve anything.
 

 
After thinking for a while, Director Chen decided to change the map: “How many maps do we have that aren’t past their copyright?”
 

 
The popular wilderness themes were gone, leaving only an urban map and a Western fantasy castle.
 

 
Director Chen pressed his forehead and made a decisive call:
 

 
“Then let’s go with the urban map. Don’t bother fixing the bug; just identify it and report it to the uploading party, asking them to compensate for the filming costs!”
 

 
“Okay!”
 

 
Duan Ge quietly finished her stretching exercises.
 

 
In her mind, the Concubine Chen was puzzled, thinking: [Isn’t the urban map your strong suit? You should be happy!]
 

 
[No…]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m just wondering if this might be a bit too unfair for others.]
# Chapter67
When the director announced the change of map, the entire venue erupted in uproar.
 

 
After all, the "home-field advantage" is a real thing.
 

 
Among the attendees, several competitors might not excel physically but had plenty of experience in outdoor survival—children raised in rural areas had certain advantages on a deserted island, while muscles built in the gym might not be much help in the jungle.
 

 
"Why the sudden change?"
 

 
"I heard there's a bug in the deserted island map."
 

 
"What kind of bug? If it's not serious, can't we just make do?"
 

 
A host who usually livestreams cooking and advertising quietly complained, "With the map change, I’ve lost my advantage."
 

 
"It's pretty serious. Apparently, a member of the development team slacked off and reused some ancient data, which caused all the T-Rex eggs to hatch on the island. There's no time to check the data, and if we use this map, we not only have to battle wild animals but also outsmart and outfight T-Rexes..."
 

 
It's gone from "National Geographic Channel" to "Jurassic Park."
 

 
The competitor who previously said it could be made to work fell silent for a moment, then grumbled, "Fine."
 

 
They had to accept reality.
 

 
They had signed performance contracts, and unless there were uncontrollable factors, they couldn't withdraw without paying a hefty penalty, as it's practically impossible for the show to bring in replacements last minute.
 

 
[The T-Rex is killing me with laughter!]
 

 
[I want to see Tong Zhao battle the T-Rex!]
 

 
[This bug… it really shows that one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch in any industry. Luckily it was discovered in time; otherwise, finding out that a survival show turned into a dinosaur cooking show right before filming would be a huge loss.]
 

 
The entire production team was relieved.
 

 
However...
 

 
After the announcement, Director Chen sat down beside Duan Ge with a big smile: "Sister Zhao, you heard the situation just now."
 

 
Tong Zhao's situation was different from the others.
 

 
She was a special invited guest, and her contract was drafted separately. The sudden map change was a breach of contract by the producers, giving her the right to leave without filming.
 

 
Everyone else watched her with eager eyes.
 

 
When the map change was announced, Duan Ge's usually calm expression showed significant signs of wavering—everyone was paying too much attention to her, even catching the slightest change in her demeanor.
 

 
Was she scared?
 

 
Although the black-box operation to change the data wasn't particularly difficult, a sudden map change would surely have some impact.
 

 
Some competitors couldn't help but speculate.
 

 
While they had preliminary activity data, being able to run and jump was completely different from surviving in extreme environments; otherwise, athletes could easily transition to special forces.
 

 
"Yes," Duan Ge nodded. "I heard.”
 

 
...
 

 
And then?
 

 
There was no "and then." Duan Ge watched him quietly, waiting for him to continue speaking.
 

 
She showed no intention of taking a stance.
 

 
In fact, Duan Ge knew he was testing her attitude—even in the apocalypse, she wasn't just a mindless brute relying solely on force. Being a leader required a good grasp of emotional intelligence. However, her mood was currently poor, and the director had just hit a nerve.
 

 
She wouldn't lash out at just anyone, but if he had something to say, he should be direct.
 

 
Tong Zhao was in a bad mood today...
 

 
Chen Director speculated, but he also sensed the other contestants' unfriendliness towards her.
 

 
Who could maintain a good temper in such an environment?
 

 
There were plenty of big-name stars who loved to throw tantrums and act aloof, making cold faces and asserting their presence was not uncommon. Tong Zhao had previously seemed approachable enough to give him the impression of "maybe I can take advantage of her." But now, with that icy glare, he quickly dismissed his earlier underestimation. He wiped the flattering smile off his face and earnestly explained the situation, sincerely apologizing and hoping she would stay.
 

 
After speaking, Director Chen was sweating profusely.
 

 
He had mentally prepared himself for Tong Zhao to explode and say she wouldn't film anymore.
 

 
After all, Director Chen knew very well that there was no black-box operation to favor Tong Zhao; her performance depended solely on herself. The public pressure she was under was immense. If she could find an excuse to walk away, it would be understandable... While she might have confidence in wilderness survival, she might not feel the same about a city map!
 

 
An easy excuse had just been handed to her.
 

 
[Tong Zhao doesn’t want to film anymore?]
 

 
[This map change is way too sudden; who would be happy about that?]
 

 
[Only she has objections while the other contestants unanimously agree? Is she really that noble?]
 

 
Those who questioned were immediately countered by more informed viewers—
 

 
[Exactly! In terms of this variety show, she is "noble" because her contract is different. A last-minute map change generally constitutes a breach of contract, giving her the right to opt out. Didn’t you see that some contestants also had concerns? Everyone came prepared for survival on a deserted island... It’s like a science student taking a liberal arts exam, got it?]
 

 
This analogy was easier to understand.
 

 
But then the comments quickly turned into a debate about the differences between the deserted island and city maps.
 

 
...
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay, no problem.”
 

 
“We really hope…”
 

 
Director Chen's persuasive words were on the tip of his tongue but then paused, realizing that the other party had readily agreed: “Huh?”
 

 
“A map change is fine,” Duan Ge patiently explained. “I thought you were going to mention other issues.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Director Chen's bewildered expression garnered a unanimous [hahahahaha] from the comments.
 

 
In that moment, the director deeply understood one thing—
 

 
Don’t play games with Tong Zhao; just speak directly and clearly.
 

 
After sweating profusely during the off-road challenge and even swimming in the pool, the production team gave everyone an hour to freshen up and rest before gathering in the shooting studio. This film studio had space for fifty holographic filming booths and was adjacent to a villa-style dormitory resembling a resort. As a special guest, Duan Ge enjoyed certain privileges, having an entire small villa to herself, complete with a garden enclosed by a grassy wall and an outdoor bathtub. Considering her status as a female star, she only took a shower indoors.
 

 
Other contestants were relaxing in a Zen-like manner while waiting for the shoot to start.
 

 
Some hurriedly sought advice from colleagues who had experience in urban survival variety shows, trying to adjust their mindset in the limited time.
 

 
There were also a few individuals who weren’t even considered variety stars; they were merely lucky enough to be selected for a chance to earn some appearance fees, dreaming of winning the prize money. They eagerly searched for a chance to get autographs and photos with female celebrities.
 

 
However, they couldn't find anyone.
 

 
They didn’t see anyone in the rest area, nor were they able to gather with the director, and the villa door displaying Duan Ge’s name indicated that the owner was temporarily unavailable.
 

 
Where could she have gone?
 

 
In the end, a clever contestant pulled out their phone to check the live stream of “One Life Survivor,” clicking on the camera that followed Tong Zhao throughout—
 

 
They had searched all the recreational facilities but had overlooked the gym inside the shooting studio.
 

 
Meanwhile, Duan Ge was running on a treadmill at a steady pace.
 

 
A flying camera hovered to her right.
 

 
Under the camera, Duan Ge slightly tilted her face up, and a droplet of sweat slid from her tight jawline down to her collarbone. The gym lights illuminated her, making her skin appear dazzlingly white. Perhaps because she wanted to focus on exercising, she wore very light makeup, which highlighted the striking features that seemed sculpted by divine design—her high nose bridge and full lips formed an impeccable profile, resembling a beautiful girl straight out of an anime.
 

 
Damn.
 

 
So beautiful.
 

 
Several male contestants watching the live stream couldn't help but start imagining—
 

 
If Tong Zhao accidentally fell into their hands during the survival show, would they dare to eliminate her?
 

 
They were thankful that the intelligent AI would block and suppress any inappropriate thoughts; otherwise, they were genuinely concerned about losing control.
 

 
[Zhao Zhao is really working hard, completely different from her role in "Emperor Ming."]
 

 
[The scariest part is that such a naturally beautiful woman is working so hard… Just finished a tiring challenge, took a shower, and now exercising. Does her stamina never run out?]
 

 
[So now are they trying to set up Tong Zhao as a strong sportswoman?]
 

 
[Huh? Is this really considered a character setup?]
 

 
The comments almost erupted again.
 

 
They didn’t because the time was up, and all the contestants gathered in the shooting studio.
 

 
Everyone lay down in the holographic shooting pods.
 

 
Duan Ge closed her eyes, waiting for the equipment to activate, and heard a faint child’s voice in her mind:
 

 
[Big sister Duan Ge, you seem really irritable lately. Are you unhappy?]
 

 
The chances for Zhao Zai to emerge were very rare.
 

 
Since it had been so long, this personality was buried deep within, and it was only during the last check of her consciousness palace that Zhao Zai had awakened.
 

 
[It's a bit,]
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t want to scare her little self and explained actively: [Every world setting and life experience in the quick-traveling has been exaggerated—like Sister Lu almost losing her life due to betrayal by her husband, I inevitably ended up with blood on my hands in the apocalypse, and Xiao Chen developed an odd personality in the palace… Each of us has obvious character flaws, and I’m just a bit restless in peaceful times. Sorry about that.]
 

 
Zhao Zai was puzzled: [Why does sister need to apologize to me?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Not becoming a perfect adult, I feel quite sorry for my childhood self.]
 

 
At this moment, the equipment activated, and a strong wave of uncontrollable drowsiness swept over her, pulling her into the depths of consciousness...
 

 
Zhao Zai still wanted to say something, but Duan Ge could no longer hear.
 

 
...
 

 
When she regained consciousness, all the contestants were initially in an uncontrollable state, with a full minute to absorb the introduced plot background.
 

 
In "One Life Survivor," the contestants retained their original memories.
 

 
Only the memories related to the survival variety show would be temporarily blocked, replaced by a new unified storyline.
 

 
[This is Ganan City, an empty city.]
 

 
[It was once the city you were most familiar with. You lived here, trading your labor or knowledge for meager rewards. A war has transformed Ganan City beyond recognition; every shadow could hide danger or opportunity.]
 

 
From a bird's-eye view, the aerial shots captured the entire concrete jungle.
 

 
If it weren't for the signs of destruction scattered throughout the high-rise buildings, it would remind one of a promotional video for a first-tier city.
 

 
[Before the withdrawal of your country’s army, three supply points were left in Ganan City.]
 

 
[Compared to the unpredictable airdrop resource packages that could land on your head or in front of the enemy, these three supply points offer you fair competition.]
 

 
A low, soft male voice emphasized "fair competition."
 

 
On the live broadcast, the map of Ganan City slowly unfolded, with the locations of the three supply points highlighted in bright yellow circles. Next, fifteen equally long routes in different colors were shown—this ensured that the "spawn points" for the five four-member teams were at equal distances from each supply point, making it a "fair competition."
 

 
This information was marked as "For Audience Only" on the live stream, and the contestants were unaware.
 

 
Some contestants might notice this detail and deduce their opponents' approximate positions.
 

 
For those who couldn't figure it out, they would just have to guess.
 

 
[Ganan City has no other living people. Your goal, as a group of twenty, is to survive for fifteen days. To stay alive, you must search for limited resources in this wasteland and learn to hide yourself in danger...]
 

 
[Due to periodic gas attacks from the enemy, the area available for safe activities will keep shrinking. Try to find enough supplies while you still have the chance to explore!]
 

 
[Alternatively, stealing from other teams is also a good option.]
 

 
[You five teams come from five different countries, and the seeds of suspicion and conflict have long been planted in your hearts. Do you really have enough trust to collaborate and achieve a win-win situation across language barriers?]
 

 
The "Language Barrier" option lit up on the live stream.
 

 
All the guests were from China, and this was a difficulty setting to prevent full cooperation among them.
 

 
[---Just try your best!]
 

 
[You are respectively the Cloud Team, Sun Team, Star Team, Moon Team, and Thunder Team.]
 

 
As the deliberately slowed narration played, the live stream switched between different teams. Since the storyline hadn’t fully been introduced, they were still unable to control their bodies, forced into a half-awake sleep as the plot unfolded.
 

 
It was like an unskippable opening CG.
 

 
[Friendly reminder: Enemy assassins are wandering in Ganan City, searching for their prey.]
 

 
[You can attempt to kill or capture her, and both will yield generous rewards.]
 

 
While all the contestants were asleep, the camera shifted.
 

 
It landed on a gray concrete floor, where a pair of pure black military boots walked steadily.
 

 
The footsteps were light.
 

 
The camera slowly panned up, revealing a section of a fair leg, followed by a woman dressed in tight black gear.
 

 
She walked outside, and the rising sun broke through the clouds, unveiling the entirety of Ganan City, casting light on her face and outlining her cold, beautiful features—
 

 
The special guest of "One Life Survivor," Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Only when you kill, capture, or are killed by her... ]
 

 
[Will you know the name of this assassin.]
 

 
[Hiss—]
 

 
[The temporary change in the map's storyline setup is really exciting! Tong Zhao is so cool QAQ]
 

 
[Assassin!]
 

 
[Shall I call out the name of the Assassin?]
 

 
[The previous Assassin was referring to the killer.]
 

 
Duan Ge woke up particularly early.
 

 
Unlike the other guests who slept until the opening CG finished, she had been wandering around for a while.
 

 
The storyline she received was different due to her "faction," and much shorter than that of the other contestants—
 

 
[You are an imperial assassin.]
 

 
[Your mission is to identify the living hidden in this city and eliminate them all.]
 

 
[This is not a simple task, as you will be facing twenty opponents.]
 

 
[Your superiors expect you to die on this mission and have not provided you with any weapons or resources; you must provide proof of your kills to exchange for survival resources.]
 

 
In her mind, a special watch appeared, the kind worn by the other contestants.
 

 
[You don’t want to die.]
 

 
[If you want to survive, you must hunt down these twenty survivors.]
 

 
[Your codename is—]
 

 
[Hunter.]
 

 
As the deep, powerful male voice finished the last English syllable, Duan Ge tilted her head back, her dark eyes seemingly locking onto those of the audience watching the live stream. The background noise faded into a whisper, leaving only her cold gaze and vibrant lips.
 

 
[...If ABO really existed, Tong Zhao would undoubtedly be an Alpha.]
 

 
[I’m crazy! Too Alpha! I used to think I was straight until I met Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Target! Aim! Shoot!]
 

 
In the large crowd of Tong Zhao's female fans, they excitedly discussed the live stream content, relieved that their sister didn’t adopt the same values as the male viewers; otherwise, they wouldn’t have witnessed her cold and cool side! Of course, the sweet and charming Tong Zhao had once captivated them at first glance, but the Tong Zhao in "One Life Survivor" made the fans want to marry her!
 

 
They wanted to be taken out by the assassin sister!
 

 
…
 

 
The assassin sister wore a displeased expression.
 

 
She had every reason to be unhappy.
 

 
Her unscrupulous superior was pushing her toward a deadly mission, which was why she was given such a challenging task.
 

 
To ensure the show began with excitement, the production team cruelly set Tong Zhao's initial hunger level to thirty, equivalent to waking up after ten hours of sleep and having just one dry piece of bread.
 

 
Meanwhile, everyone else started with an eighty hunger level.
 

 
This was to urge her to quickly hunt down the other contestants.
 

 
Duan Ge found herself on the top floor of a building disguised as a ruin, where she could send signals to headquarters for resource exchanges via a special watch—her base as a hunter and her sleeping place—
 

 
which was just a simple nylon bed.
 

 
It was identical to the one in Tong Zhao's consciousness palace, likely a gag by the production team.
 

 
"So annoying..."
 

 
Duan Ge clasped her hands and moved her joints.
 

 
The intelligent AI did not broadcast her inner thoughts, leaving the audience to guess.
 

 
At the same time, the members of the five teams gradually woke up.
 

 
After receiving the background setting, their reactions varied. Some first-time participants were overwhelmed by the dire situation and burst into tears while holding onto their teammates.
 

 
"I want to go home..."
 

 
"Can we really survive for fifteen days? There’s no food, and we can’t even hide to get through this."
 

 
A short-haired man, about 1.8 meters tall, cried on his teammate's shoulder.
 

 
People are easily influenced by the atmosphere; listening to his muffled sobs, the remaining three teammates felt the pressure and couldn’t find comforting words to say, only managing to awkwardly say, "Stop crying, it won’t help."
 

 
This only made him more distraught.
 

 
[While it's human nature, given the circumstances, why do I feel like laughing?]
 

 
[Laughing 1, I hope some narrow-minded elementary students realize that vulnerability isn’t exclusive to women; stereotypes that discriminate against women also oppress men.]
 

 
[If I were in their shoes, not knowing it’s a variety show, I would definitely be scared...]
 

 
In the live broadcast, the other four teams had cautiously begun to explore. Everyone recognized the importance of the supply points, and with three supply points to be divided among five teams, conflicts were highly likely. The best strategy was to reach one first and secure the resources.
 

 
Only the team with the emotionally broken member stood still, each person looking troubled. The contestants only had vague information about the supply points.
 

 
They didn't know the exact locations of the supplies.
 

 
For example, Point A was marked as the McDonald's at 280 Qilisi Avenue, but it was a larger McDonald's. Where exactly inside the store were the supplies kept? That would require the contestants to go in and search for themselves.
 

 
Once found, they had to transport the supplies quickly.
 

 
Otherwise, they risked being outpaced by others or getting into a conflict that would leave both parties worse off.
 

 
At this moment, two groups were approaching the McDonald's at Point A, one right after the other.
 

 
The two teams had about a five-minute time difference.
 

 
The first team to arrive successfully entered the McDonald's. Upon entering, they immediately noticed that the kitchen was devoid of any food, and even the straws and tissue boxes that were supposed to be available in unlimited quantities were empty. After confirming that the inside was relatively safe, the leader signaled for his teammates to come in—he remained vigilant, indicating that they should pay attention to the other door in case other teams entered, so they wouldn’t get trapped inside and forced into a conflict.
 

 
As two of them entered the kitchen, one stayed outside to keep watch.
 

 
“Captain!”
 

 
He Su excitedly called the captain over when he discovered a box in the storage room, eager to take credit.
 

 
Since all useful supplies in the store were gone, he instinctively thought he had found a supply pack. Just as the captain came over, delighted, he heard a strange noise: “Wait, there’s something odd inside.”
 

 
Tick-tock... tick-tock...
 

 
A faint, strange sound that could only be detected by careful listening.
 

 
There was a broom by the door, and the captain held the broomstick, slowly prying open the box.
 

 
At the moment the stick lifted the lid, a spark ignited—
 

 
Boom!
 

 
The two of them instinctively fell back, only to be hit by a noxious chemical smell.
 

 
Fortunately, the explosion's force was minor, and since they had anticipated it, they managed to retreat in time. Aside from being covered in smoke and their hearts racing, they suffered no injuries.
 

 
But if someone had been right next to the box when it exploded or had opened it barehanded, they might have lost an arm or worse.
 

 
“If I had just opened the box directly...”
 

 
The terrifying image flashed through He Su's mind, leaving him shaken.
 

 
“Every dark corner may hide danger or opportunity,” the captain repeated the words left by their reinforcements.
 

 
In Ganan City, there were dangers left behind by the enemy, which could be a small “surprise” or an unreasonable landmine.
 

 
To navigate this city in search of survival, without extraordinary luck, one had to be extremely cautious!
 

 
“What happened?”
 

 
The earlier explosion had attracted the attention of other teammates. A young boy, Chen Xiangtai, peeked in and said, “I found a cardboard box under the cash register in the dining area. Captain, come check if it's what we’re looking for!”
 

 
The captain quickly and concisely briefed Chen Xiangtai on what had just happened and acknowledged his caution: “Well done. We need to move quickly; that explosion was loud, and it’s possible others heard it.”
 

 
This time, they had successfully found a supply box filled with food and drinking water.
 

 
Another team would arrive in two minutes.
 

 
Fortunately, they hadn’t heard any noise from the kitchen.
 

 
Only a pair of eyes, which had captivated countless souls, stood at a high vantage point observing the activity on the street.
 

 
“Ah, I see food!”
 

 
Duan Ge's gaze fell on the second team rushing toward point A.
# Chapter68
The once globally popular reality show "One Life Survivor" focused on the conflicts between humans and nature, as well as the tensions among people. To emphasize the former, the filming locations were set on resource-scarce islands (the production team intentionally chose places without easily accessible natural resources). To stimulate the latter, an elimination system was established.
 

 
Many subsequent survival-themed shows originated from this concept.
 

 
To enhance viewer engagement, the production team preferred contestants of equal strength rather than a solo act dominating the stage, which is why they invited Tong Zhao to play the role of the hunter—part of the consideration was to "balance the power."
 

 
While all the other contestants had yet to obtain weapons, the hunter already had a crossbow. If given to a burly man with relevant experience, he might eliminate an entire team by himself. Giving it to a fit female celebrity, however, was seen as more balanced.
 

 
The entire production team was quite pleased with this arrangement.
 

 
At that moment, Duan Ge, who had just discovered the whereabouts of the other contestants, was descending.
 

 
—And she was really going down.
 

 
Repeated explosions had left many buildings in Ganan City in disrepair, with frequent missing tiles on the east side or gaping holes on the west, and entire ceilings blown away. Duan Ge climbed down the fire escape, the wind tousling her short hair, as she hummed "Hotel California" leisurely.
 

 
Viewers watching this scene momentarily felt as though they were watching an action blockbuster.
 

 
She had originally had long hair.
 

 
However, after pondering for a while, she couldn't figure out why she, as an assassin, had grown long hair in the first place. Even if tied back into a manageable ponytail, it could easily become a noticeable weakness in close combat, where being grabbed by the hair would be quite troublesome.
 

 
Without hesitation, Duan Ge took a small knife and cut her hair to a neck-length bob.
 

 
This action left her fans feeling a chill.
 

 
Soon after, they noticed that Tong Zhao had a small face, and her short hairstyle accentuated her delicate features, making their hearts warm again.
 

 
Even with a messy haircut, the beautiful sister looked good—especially with her stylish short hair!
 

 
Assassins never take the main roads.
 

 
Similarly, Duan Ge preferred not to walk the main path.
 

 
Her aversion stemmed from her experiences in the apocalypse, where countless eyes lurked in the shadows. Walking the main road was just asking to be ambushed. Thus, viewers watched as she effortlessly navigated between buildings in a straight line, like a wildcat roaming the city, unconcerned with human-made paths—why should a little cat adhere to human social rules?
 

 
If this segment of Duan Ge’s actions were cut out, it would make a delightful parkour short video.
 

 
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
 

 
Duan Ge landed on a rooftop, bending slightly before leaping to a lower terrace.
 

 
From a bird’s-eye view, the height between the buildings looked perilous, a misstep could mean fatal consequences.
 

 
Traditional viewers were fine, but the immersive experience of holographic viewing had many feeling weak in the knees.
 

 
Duan Ge’s movements were decisive, showing no hesitation.
 

 
The camera maintained a distance that was neither too close nor too far, allowing the audience to see her expressionless, cool profile, with only her breathing slightly quickening.
 

 
A special alert from the production team read: “Dangerous actions, please do not attempt.”
 

 
[Wow, my legs are shaking!!!]
 

 
[What’s so impressive about this? I did it all the time before I broke my leg.]
 

 
[Thinking about it, if she falls, it’s not just a broken leg that’s at stake.]
 

 
The audience's first reaction was that the official had given her cheat codes.
 

 
"One Life Survivor" is a relatively credible variety show.
 

 
Regardless of whether it's the template or the storyline, everything is published on the official website—like in a cop drama, where the lead gets the [shooting] skill, it’s not just a simple line of text saying they’ve acquired it; multiple lines of code must be integrated into the lead's subconscious.
 

 
Even if a skill is mastered, based on personal style, the lead might not use a gun as their primary weapon.
 

 
Just like someone who has never used a gun may instinctively grab the nearest item—a folding chair—when confronted with conflict; it’s a matter of thought patterns, it’s subconscious.
 

 
Astute variety show fans checked the official website and found that there were no related skills assigned to Tong Zhao.
 

 
This proved that her walking habits were genuine.
 

 
She doesn’t take the usual path.
 

 
[So, can some fans chime in? Does your sister in real life also dislike walking properly? /doge]
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans were just as perplexed.
 

 
Despite watching countless interviews and keeping up with her on social media, thinking they understood her well...
 

 
Every time Tong Zhao appeared, there was always something new to discover!
 

 
[If I had to describe Tong Zhao with a food, I’d say she’s a lasagna.]
 

 
[You only see the second layer; you think she’s the first layer, but she’s actually on the fifth!]
 

 
[So hard to see through her!]
 

 
Climbing the fire escape on the outside of a skyscraper might be bold for a normal person, but she effortlessly slid down the vertical pipes attached to the wall, with no footholds in sight.
 

 
Duan Ge's parkour route was not just impressive; she significantly shortened the time it took to get from Point A to Point B. In the blink of an eye, she landed in the alley behind the McDonald's kitchen. She approached the door quietly and overheard two teams inside.
 

 
[Wow x100]
 

 
[This place looks a bit dilapidated; it probably can't support an adult's weight... Anyway, don’t try this; we don’t know any tricks.]
 

 
[Maybe they climbed down when no one was watching the pipe.]
 

 
[That makes sense.]
 

 
A minute earlier, a member of the Sun Team, on lookout duty, heard the approaching footsteps and immediately interrupted his teammate's excitement over finding supplies, urging them to leave through the second door quickly.
 

 
The McDonald's had three doors.
 

 
Two faced the customers and led to the dining area.
 

 
The last one was in the back kitchen, facing the alley.
 

 
“Someone's coming!”
 

 
“Quick, go!”
 

 
“Damn, someone got here first!”
 

 
The captain of the later-arriving Cloud Team hesitated for a moment. Although he couldn’t understand what the Sun Team was saying, he sensed their anxiousness from their expressions—this meant they were also afraid of conflict!
 

 
In this instant, he quickly called his teammates to advance and fight for the supplies.
 

 
Duan Ge stood at the back door and listened for a moment.
 

 
The smart AI scanned her thoughts:
 

 
[Once again, I can’t understand their chatter.]
 

 
[Hmm, seven guys and one girl.]
 

 
According to the variety show’s settings, as the "hunter," she also couldn't understand the other contestants' languages. However, she could categorize each voice based on subtle differences, immediately visualizing the specific number and gender of the speakers in her mind.
 

 
Upon seeing this, the variety show fans became excited, eagerly anticipating a fight with one celebrity taking on eight.
 

 
However, the next moment, Duan Ge decisively made a choice: “Hmm, there are too many people to take on, I’ll wait a bit.”
 

 
...?
 

 
Wait, does your dictionary really have the words "too many to handle"?
 

 
Perhaps Tong Zhao's earlier unexpected moves had raised the audience's expectations to a Super Saiyan level. Now, seeing her practical mindset made the audience both amused and understanding—yes, she wasn't Superman, nor a berserker charging into the crowd; she was a nimble and perceptive assassin.
 

 
The production team noticed this change and couldn't help but admire how intuitive Tong Zhao's subconscious was.
 

 
If she maintained a perfect persona all the time, completing missions would just be satisfactory, not stunning.
 

 
Unintentionally, she showcased the strategy of building up before revealing strength…
 

 
Director Chen commented, “Her subconscious really brings a sense of drama, it’s amazing.”
 

 
In reality, the director was overthinking it.
 

 
Duan Ge was just a practical person; as long as they could scan her thoughts, they’d realize she was particularly "calculative," skilled at finding the optimal solution in chaotic situations.
 

 
The Sun Team's hesitation had its reasons. Among the four, there was a female doctor who probably thought she couldn’t take on four big men. Unexpectedly, the female doctor of the Sun Team quickly grabbed a chair and smashed it onto the attackers' knees. The force from their close encounter startled the opponents.
 

 
Inside the McDonald's, a fierce battle was underway.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded repeatedly, leaving the audience wondering what she was up to.
 

 
Is she catching the rhythm now?
 

 
The AI promptly scanned her thoughts:
 

 
【A horse stance forward, throw a left hook, then a right hook… quickly use the nunchaku, hum hum ha!】
 

 
……
 

 
She was still humming.
 

 
Due to the reality of not being discovered, she was quietly humming in her mind, still to Jay Chou's "Nunchaku," skipping over the parts she forgot.
 

 
Having just "woken up" in the variety show, everyone was still getting into the groove. The members of the Cloud Team were startled by the fierce display from the female doctor, and in a moment of distraction, the opposing team managed to escape. Hearing that one side had fled, Duan Ge slipped into the kitchen.
 

 
At this moment, the entire Cloud Team's attention was focused on the direction the Sun Team had fled, unaware of the pair of eyes watching them from the kitchen.
 

 
Duan Ge: 【Four of them...】
 

 
Duan Ge: 【I can probably handle this.】
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[I take back what I said about her being a normal person!]
 

 
[No, what do you mean "probably handle"? Sister Zhao, wait, let’s talk this through!/panic/panic]
 

 
Duan Ge readied her crossbow:
 

 
Duan Ge thought clearly: 【My lousy boss only left me two arrows, damn it.】
 

 
She knew that her ranged weapon was meant to weaken the strongest member of the opposing team, who would be a difficult opponent in close combat—undoubtedly the Cloud Team's captain, a tall man nearly six feet tall with a background in sports.
 

 
As she readied her crossbow, the audience held their breath.
 

 
Could she hit her target?
 

 
Keep in mind, her boss not only left her with just two arrows but also didn't give her any shooting skills.
 

 
Soon, the answer was revealed!
 

 
The moment she pulled the trigger, although it didn’t produce a terrifyingly loud bang like a gun, the ensuing gasp confirmed its power—the captain, about to exit McDonald's, howled as he slumped against the wall, collapsing to the ground: “What the fuck? I got hit?!” He touched his wound in disbelief: “An arrow???”
 

 
In "One Life Survivor," pain perception is significantly reduced.
 

 
All contestants accepted this setup without feeling it was unusual.
 

 
However, sustaining multiple injuries would still decrease their mobility.
 

 
Even if the Cloud Team's captain managed to stand up, he would lose combat effectiveness for a while…
 

 
The unexpected attack, combined with the leader's injury, threw the remaining three into chaos. Duan Ge knew this was her fleeting advantage; she had to take out all four of them before they could react. She vaulted over the counter, landed on a table, and with a powerful push, jumped onto one of their shoulders, using her thigh to exert force. Within seconds, the first person was knocked out.
 

 
How to defeat the strong with the weak, to fight solo against many?
 

 
If Duan Ge were to explain, she would say that combat skill is the most important.
 

 
Why can a small, frail assailant kill a tall, strong man? It’s about catching them off guard. Most ordinary people are law-abiding citizens who freeze in fear when faced with evil, becoming even weaker when injured, panicking and only knowing to throw wild punches when fighting back.
 

 
Of course, brawls among ordinary citizens are on the same level.
 

 
But Duan Ge is not ordinary.
 

 
Her combat skills have long been ingrained in her bones through countless skirmishes and ambushes.
 

 
Even her mind sees it as trivial, hardly producing any adrenaline.
 

 
Ordinary people struggle psychologically before life-and-death fights, hesitating over whether they might kill someone… Predators are always in the minority; humans are social creatures, and killing is undoubtedly an act of alienation, a behavior that exiles one from the community. Duan Ge has long been accustomed to the process of humans turning into beasts, and she doesn’t need to wrestle with that.
 

 
If you don’t want to kill, then you shouldn’t draw your weapon in the first place.
 

 
The resolve to put someone to death is the sharpest blade in Duan Ge's hand.
 

 
If life-and-death combat is akin to treasure hunting in water, ordinary people are like beginner swimmers, while Duan Ge is an amphibian; she can calmly and skillfully dive in and find what she seeks—
 

 
The enemy’s vital points.
 

 
The latest episode of "One Life Survivor" features the most popular combat U1, which displays both sides' heart rates, HP values, and fighting spirit levels—when fighting spirit decreases, a person begins to show fear and looks for a chance to escape; when it hits rock bottom, they lose all desire to resist, kneeling down to plead for mercy.
 

 
And in the live broadcast—
 

 
Hunter "Tong Zhao"
 

 
Heart Rate: 140 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 80
 

 
Cloud Team "Shi Sha Tao"
 

 
Heart Rate: 180 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 40
 

 
[Wait, is Tong Zhao’s heart rate during a light jog? Are these two really engaged in the same fight?]
 

 
[You see her looking calm, but her fighting spirit is really high.]
 

 
[How is that determined?]
 

 
Since this is a newly launched system, the audience doesn't understand the principles behind it.
 

 
They might not get it, but they certainly understand the scene where the assassin takes down everyone with a cold face:
 

 
One summary in the comments gets a lot of praise: [Got it, it boils down to four words—steady hands and ruthless.]
 

 
If Duan Ge couldn’t handle eight people, she would instantly become the target of concentrated fire.
 

 
Just like some wild animals won’t attack groups of humans, when the numbers drop to a certain point, they will hesitate no longer, pouncing from the shadows to bite the throat of the straggler, taking them down one by one.
 

 
Everything happened very quickly.
 

 
Without any cinematic slow motion, Duan Ge's speed had the audience furiously typing question marks.
 

 
Good movies don’t have dull moments, and her fight scenes left the audience without even a chance to blink; in the blink of an eye, a big man had fallen. The differences in muscle, height, gender, and age seemed irrelevant before this assassin.
 

 
So fierce that it made the audience's hearts race.
 

 
Yet she was also very beautiful.
 

 
The audience's gaze drifted between her expressive eyes, slightly parted red lips, and the contours of her body.
 

 
Blood splattered onto Duan Ge's cheek.
 

 
She closed her eyes quickly, avoiding any in her eyes, and raised her hand to wipe her face with the back of her hand.
 

 
The captain, who had initially been shot and incapacitated, ended up being the last survivor.
 

 
Cloud Team "Pei Sijie"
 

 
Heart Rate: 177 bpm
 

 
Fighting Spirit: 10
 

 
Director Chen switched to Pei Sijie’s perspective, who was sitting on the ground, looking up at Duan Ge with sheer fear on his face.
 

 
Duan Ge stepped through a pool of blood and approached him.
 

 
Her steps were light and graceful, fitting in perfectly even at a gala.
 

 
Pei Sijie was too scared to speak.
 

 
The exemption from pain didn’t make him braver; rather, it diminished the courage needed for a desperate fight to the death. He still believed he could survive, as long as the deadly figure in front of him spared his life.
 

 
Those who rely on their opponents to spare them cannot win.
 

 
[It’s over, it’s over, it’s over…]
 

 
The audience could hear his racing heartbeat.
 

 
Duan Ge, however, had a slight smile, her eyes curving with an expression of delight, as if pleased.
 

 
She nudged Pei Sijie's thigh with the tip of her boot, causing the wound in his side to reopen and let out a small trickle of blood: “Hey, you can move, right?”
 

 
Pei Sijie didn’t understand.
 

 
He covered his wound while begging for mercy and apologizing.
 

 
“Ah, forgot you can’t understand,”
 

 
Duan Ge lost interest instantly.
 

 
[It’s okay, we understand! Zhaozhao, say more QAQ]
 

 
[Want to hear 1]
 

 
“My first arrow was a bit off; I didn’t hit your heart, just your lower back,” Duan Ge lifted her foot, pressing the boot against the arrow’s end, slowly and firmly driving it deeper into his abdomen: “You could stand up, but you didn’t. You watched your teammates die and chose to plead with me… From their attitude towards you, you must be a little leader, right?”
 

 
Duan Ge: [Forget it, it’s boring.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [All dog bosses in the world are the same.]
 

 
Duan Ge had good qualities and didn’t take pleasure in torturing her prey; she ignored the heavy undertones of Pei Sijie’s pleading and gave him a swift end. Then, she removed the watches from the wrists of the four and gathered them.
 

 
After a moment’s thought, she also took any visible jewelry and miscellaneous items from them.
 

 
Duan Ge actually wanted to strip off their clothes.
 

 
However, this fell under restricted behavior. Even though she had no inappropriate subjective intentions, the system would still prevent her from such excessive thoughts to protect the contestants' minimum dignity.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I don’t want to expose my target, which is their watches.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Let’s just leave it at this…]
 

 
Duan Ge: [It would be great if I could blow this place up in one go.]
 

 
The light fell on the assassin’s face, casting a gentle hue.
 

 
Only the audience knew that her mind was filled with anything but gentle and merciless thoughts.
 

 
They had no doubt that as long as she had the materials and conditions allowed, she would indeed blow the entire restaurant to smithereens.
 

 
The audience felt a bit dazed.
 

 
[Duan Ge caught four lone ones by herself?]
 

 
[Oh my, it’s like four soft and crispy players ran into a fully geared assassin and were wiped out in the blink of an eye.]
 

 
[False dangers: landmines and poison gas; true danger: Duan Ge.]
 

 
While the audience was dazed, the production team was losing it.
 

 
Director: “Thick crab…”
 

 
Assistant Director: “Ward?”
 

 
In the filming studio, the four innocent and pitiful contestants woke up in the holographic filming chamber. Pei Sijie looked around in confusion and raised his hand to report: “Director, it seems there’s a problem with the filming chamber; I didn’t enter the survival show.”
 

 
Shi Shatao raised his hand: “Me too.”
 

 
The other two members of the Cloud Team also raised their hands, eager to give feedback.
 

 
However, what they received was a subtle gaze of disappointment mixed with pity from the production staff, leaving them puzzled as they glanced at the clock on the wall—sure enough, it wasn’t long before the equipment had indeed malfunctioned!
 

 
Director Chen waved his hand: “Xiao Wu, go talk to them and find out what happened.”
 

 
Was there even half an hour since the start?
 

 
Editing it down, there might only be fifteen minutes of content?
 

 
… No, we can focus on giving more shots to Tong Zhao to extend the time, making the sacrifice of these four contestants seem less pointless. Director Chen exchanged glances with others, and they all saw the shared pain in each other's eyes.
 

 
There are twenty contestants, and with Tong Zhao, that makes twenty-one.
 

 
Starting off by losing four—how are we supposed to film this?
 

 
And looking at Tong Zhao's subconscious…
 

 
Fewer than five people are seen by her as easy targets.
 

 
According to the show's setting, teams cannot communicate or cooperate…
 

 
To prevent teams from banding together for peaceful coexistence, the production team had unintentionally turned into Tong Zhao's slaughterhouse.
 

 
“This episode's audience retention rate has hit a new high!” an excited staff member exclaimed.
 

 
Director Chen shook his head, pointing out the problem: “Don't be shortsighted: the high retention is because Tong Zhao made a big move, raising the audience's expectations significantly—think about it, if you were the audience, wouldn't you be curious about how this survival show can continue after losing one-fifth of its contestants in less than half an hour?”
 

 
The staff nodded honestly.
 

 
“That’s exactly it,” Director Chen held his head in despair: “I want to know how to continue filming too!”
 

 
The worst situation for a survival show is when everyone is ordinary, just waiting to die at the starting point.
 

 
The second worst is a series of solo acts.
 

 
The audience would get bored quickly, leading to a severe imbalance.
 

 
A meticulously prepared survival variety show turning into someone's personal showcase is something the director absolutely does not want.
 

 
The assistant director suggested, “What if we throw in four more people?”
 

 
“That would just seem like cheating…”
 

 
The director shook his head again, pondering: “How about this—let's remove the language barrier between the teams and see if the remaining teams can find a way to work together against the hunter.”
 

 
Staff member: “Chen, wouldn’t that also be cheating?”
 

 
Director Chen: “This is just a desperate measure.”
 

 
After some thought, everyone realized there was no better solution and agreed to change the rules as the director suggested.
 

 
Thus, the audience in the live stream saw a special effects announcement in the chat—
 

 
Temporary Announcement
 

 
“Except for the Cloud Team, the other teams are all citizens of the same country and can communicate freely. [Crying face emoji]”
 

 
The audience slowly began to flood the chat with question marks.
 

 
[Don't ask, just know that Tong Zhao is too awesome.]
 

 
[Can anyone explain what's going on?]
 

 
[The production team definitely didn’t expect Tong Zhao to be a walking cheat code. They initially had the language barrier for balance but realized they miscalculated and quickly patched it to stabilize the situation; otherwise, they couldn't continue filming.]
 

 
After a fan explained, even some viewers who usually don’t watch survival shows began to understand.
 

 
Tong Zhao, a woman who made the production team change the rules!
 

 
And this woman, upon returning to base, tentatively used a watch to trade for promised resources from her superiors…
 

 
She received a gun, which contained only one bullet.
 

 
And three packs of Master Kong instant noodles.
 

 
The instant noodle packaging had three stickers on it, labeled "Breakfast," "Lunch," and "Dinner."
 

 
Duan Ge: "..."
 

 
In that moment, the cold and stylish imperial assassin turned into a worker exploited by her boss.
# Chapter69
Angry as she was, she still had to eat.
 

 
After all, she was too hungry.
 

 
The imperial assassin could only bow down to instant noodles.
 

 
Duan Ge ripped open the packaging.
 

 
When she looked inside and didn't find the seasoning packet, the cold, beautiful face wavered again. Her pale hand crushed the noodle block through the packaging. Watching the unlucky assassin struggle, the audience couldn't help but burst into laughter.
 

 
["Tong Zhao is just too, too cute!"]
 

 
["An assassin who's working while eating plain instant noodles without the seasoning packet feels so painfully real… I can't believe I'm feeling the hardship of being an overworked employee in a survival show. After finishing a tough day of overtime and wanting a good meal, but the takeout you ordered turns out awful—it's enough to break your spirit."]
 

 
["Production team, have a heart! I know you're reading the comments, give my girl a decent meal!"]
 

 
The third comment was upvoted to high visibility and bolded.
 

 
But it was no use—the production team knew this would hit the audience’s soft spot.
 

 
Is a particular contestant especially capable and popular with the viewers?
 

 
Great! Make things harder for them! The audience will keep complaining but still watch.
 

 
Since there was no electricity at the ruins and no hot water at the base, Duan Ge bit directly into the crunchy noodles, gnawing them as if she was chewing on the skull of her annoying boss. After finishing the whole block, her hunger level rose to 50, which left her in an awkward spot of "barely not hungry, but definitely not full."
 

 
With Duan Ge's level of activity, she wouldn't gain weight even on a feast of meat.
 

 
She needed more calories!
 

 
Eating three packs of instant noodles a day, and dry at that—if the survivor doesn't die first, she'll want to.
 

 
Duan Ge jumped twice on the spot to vent her frustration.
 

 
Her legs were long and straight. Not long ago, she had used those beautiful legs to press against an enemy's carotid artery, causing them to pass out from lack of oxygen. Her whole body was a lethal weapon, but when she wasn't fighting or showing off her skills, the audience found her adorable—
 

 
["Those two little jumps make her look like a bunny!"]
 

 
A cold comment from a passerby: ["That bunny could kick your head clean off."]
 

 
["Stop, I can picture it now."]
 

 
Duan Ge pursed her lips, realizing they were a bit dry.
 

 
Dry noodles are dry enough, but with no water in her supplies, it was practically the definition of "extra dry." Thinking about it carefully, how could there be no water in the supplies—weren't they deliberately making things difficult? Clean drinking water is a critical survival resource.
 

 
As for the survivors in the city, Duan Ge knew little: there were twenty people in total, but the gender and age ratio was unclear. Judging from the recent conflict between two teams, it seemed the survivors weren't in the United States, which worked to her advantage.
 

 
Duan Ge: "If none of them are alone, even I'd find it troublesome."
 

 
["Now that's more like an assassin."]
 

 
["As long as I kill all the witnesses, it's a successful stealth mission!"]
 

 
The audience nodded in agreement.
 

 
Duan Ge: "But there are advantages to groups gathering, too."
 

 
Duan Ge: "I'll need to find a way to get some explosives, just in case..."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Sigh, that kind of stuff should've been prepared by my boss. I'm not really good at handling that."
 

 
["Huh?"]
 

 
["Okay, explosions are art. Anything can be assassin gear!"]
 

 
["Traditional assassin equipment: black clothes and a grappling hook; modern assassin equipment: explosives."]
 

 
In the variety show, the “annoying boss,” who in reality was the production team, subtly added a special effects subtitle: “If we prepare anything more for you, the show would end in a day,” accompanied by a trembling, cartoonish dog emoji. It was a precise attempt to be cute without being annoying, turning their rule-changing "desperate move" into something more palatable. After all, everyone knew Tong Zhao wasn’t in it for the prize money; the production team clearly wanted the show to be entertaining. Making small rule adjustments was understandable.
 

 
The audience was thoroughly amused.
 

 
Where was the supposed apocalyptic atmosphere?
 

 
Where was the brutal combat in the ruins?
 

 
Even though they understood, they were still eagerly waiting for Tong Zhao to dominate her opponents!
 

 
This series of cheeky maneuvers indirectly proved that Tong Zhao wasn’t colluding with the production team. But, if there was any shady business going on, it wasn’t about favoring Tong Zhao. Instead, it seemed more like the opposite—making things harder for her.
 

 
...
 

 
Duan Ge casually stuffed the remaining unredeemed watches under her pillow.
 

 
Wasn’t she redeeming them all to see if there might be other useful items?
 

 
Just as the audience began to wonder, the AI revealed her inner thoughts and cleared up the confusion:
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’m saving up for a ten-pull before redeeming.”
 

 
["Ten-pull, hahaha!"]
 

 
["Come on, production team, at least guarantee an SR self-heating hotpot with the ten-pull!"]
 

 
["Look at how they’ve pushed the imperial assassin!"]
 

 
Director Chen didn’t expect Tong Zhao’s subconscious to take her acting skills to a new level—she was like a walking meme machine. He quickly instructed the effects team to create a prize wheel, which would be used the next time Tong Zhao came to redeem her items. They also came up with a small event: the top ten viewers on the gift leaderboard, all wearing Tong Zhao fan badges, would participate in a prize draw. Whatever the fan won, Tong Zhao would receive in the survival show.
 

 
If those ten fans were willing, they could even fill out their address in the background, and the production team would send them a real-life version of the item their idol received.
 

 
If the fan was super lucky, their idol might just end up with a self-heating hotpot, freshly coded by the modeling team working overtime!
 

 
If the fan drawing the prize for their idol has bad luck, well, sorry—your idol will just have to keep eating instant noodles without a seasoning packet...
 

 
Tong Zhao's fan clubs, a few unofficial support groups, immediately got anxious, determined to make sure she got a decent meal. Five members in the top ten leaderboard were wealthy patrons from her fan club. These rich fans certainly had money, but since they usually just spent directly on mobile games, they had no idea if they were lucky or not. So, they started asking other fans with better luck to draw for them in the support group.
 

 
In real life, the “lucky” and “unlucky” fans were teaming up to ensure Zhao Zhao could finally enjoy a hotpot feast.
 

 
In the variety show world, the Sun Squad returned to their "spawn point"—a partially destroyed house with half the ceiling blown off, but with three intact walls and a secure front door, which seemed safe enough. They opened a box to check their supplies.
 

 
At the bottom were 24 bottles of 500ml mineral water, stacked neatly. On top of that were various canned foods, and finally, there was a layer of tightly packed, individually wrapped small bread rolls, which bounced out like little white rabbits as soon as the box was opened. Rice was hard to come by, but the bread could be dipped in the canned food—quite a thoughtful arrangement.
 

 
[...]
 

 
["I'm losing it here... Won't Tong Zhao just break down if she sees this?"]
 

 
["The production team has no chill, hahaha!"]
 

 
The team captain pondered for a moment and said, "Everyone's tired. Let’s each have a bread roll, and two people can share a can. Let’s eat something first."
 

 
He Su chose a can of luncheon meat and shared it with the female doctor.
 

 
He tore open the bread roll and stuffed some luncheon meat inside.
 

 
The cold, unheated meat was a bit greasy, but He Su was so hungry that even the grease soaking into the bread became delicious. The four of them silently finished their portions of bread. He Su couldn’t hold back and muttered quietly, “Is this all we get to eat? How are we supposed to last fifteen days? Preparing something better wouldn’t cost much.”
 

 
The female doctor patted him on the shoulder and said, “Be grateful we have anything to eat.”
 

 
He Su, still frustrated, added, “It’s hard to accept that the enemy’s lackeys are feasting while we’re stuck gnawing on bread and cold canned food.”
 

 
Due to the storyline’s faction setup, He Su’s reference to the “enemy’s lackeys” was a direct jab at Tong Zhao.
 

 
["The ‘enemy lackey’ is over there gnawing on plain instant noodles, so let’s not bring her into this."]
 

 
["Good thing Tong Zhao doesn’t speak their language, or would she be furious hearing this?"]
 

 
["Now I want to see an angry bunny!"]
 

 
It’s unclear who started it, but somehow, Tong Zhao had been nicknamed "bunny" by the audience.
 

 
There was no hidden food stash in the house—no safe, no basement. After some discussion, the Sun Squad decided to hide half of their supplies deep under the bed and cover them with miscellaneous items. Canaan City was a tiny, remote place, and the chances of running into one of the twenty survivors were slim, let alone having their base discovered. The captain reasoned, “From the outside, this place looks like any other abandoned house. The chances of someone coming in while we’re out and doing a full search are very low. Don’t worry about things that haven’t happened. What are we going to do, stash our food in a bank?”
 

 
The banks in Canaan City had been bombed into ruins. Cash was now as worthless as scrap paper, even less valuable than toilet paper.
 

 
At least toilet paper could be used to wipe your face.
 

 
After the captain finished, the group found his reasoning sound and stopped worrying.
 

 
The conversation then shifted to the conflict that had occurred while searching for supplies.
 

 
He Su said, “Sister Tan was so cool—she threw a chair and scared them all off. They didn’t even bother chasing us afterward.”
 

 
Sister Tan was the female doctor on their team.
 

 
Actually, she had decent stamina. After all, being a doctor requires endurance—without it, one could collapse during surgery. When the young, enthusiastic teammate praised her, she didn’t feel much emotion, but instead voiced her suspicion: “...I noticed that after they recovered and wanted to chase us, we weren’t running very fast. But after a while, there was no noise at all. It’s a bit strange.”
 

 
At the time, they had been so scared, adrenaline was pumping through them. They bolted out the door and ran as fast as they could, avoiding retracing their steps to avoid being followed. Instead, they took several detours before finally returning to their “spawn point,” the residential area in Julong District.
 

 
Thinking back now...
 

 
The captain said, “Yeah, after we reached the end of the street, we couldn’t hear anything anymore.”
 

 
Although he could run much faster, he held back, struggling with himself but ultimately slowing down to stay at the back of the team to protect those who were slower: “From what I remember, as soon as we left the store, they didn’t chase us. I even heard a strange scream.”
 

 
That was the Cloud Team’s captain howling like a wounded pig after being shot with an arrow.
 

 
Sister Tan added, “I heard that too.”
 

 
He Su disagreed, “It sounded more like a roar to me.”
 

 
A roar could make sense too, as a way to boost morale.
 

 
One of the team members quietly suggested, “Should we... go back and take a look?”
 

 
The captain shook his head, fearing an ambush.
 

 
His reasoning was clear: since they had already secured food, it was better to stay holed up until their supplies ran low before taking another risk. “Why look for trouble when you don’t have to? Surviving these fifteen days is the real goal of this game. If we must take a risk, I’ll be the one to go.”
 

 
He patted a teammate on the head. “Don’t overthink it. We don’t know when the enemy might release poison gas. Keep an eye on the alerts on your watch.”
 

 
The poison gas was released at random intervals.
 

 
However, thirty minutes before the gas was released, the watch would display a map of Canaan City along with an official warning, giving any players in the affected area time to escape.
 

 
“If we have to take risks, we might as well check out the other two supply points,” He Su suggested.
 

 
So, what were the conditions at the other two supply points?
 

 
The Thunder Team had exceptional luck. When they arrived at their supply point, they didn’t run into any other teams and successfully gathered food supplies and a small amount of basic medical supplies from a hospital.
 

 
The Star Team and Moon Team evenly split the supplies at an elementary school supply point.
 

 
Although they only got half of what was available, they came away without any injuries.
 

 
From the audience's omniscient perspective, not running into Tong Zhao was a huge stroke of luck.
 

 
This turn of events surprised both the audience and the production team.
 

 
How did they manage to negotiate without speaking the same language?
 

 
AI-scanned thoughts revealed the answer—
 

 
Star Team Captain: "Damn, the other side looks strong. We wouldn’t have the advantage in a fight."
 

 
Moon Team Captain: "Those muscles must’ve come from eating protein powder. If I took a punch, even if I didn’t die, I’d definitely get a concussion."
 

 
After weighing the pros and cons, both sides tentatively used gestures to express minimal friendliness. They then divided the resources equally and backed away slowly while keeping each other in view. They only turned around and left once they had reached a safe distance, ensuring there was no opportunity for a sudden betrayal.
 

 
When every potential human treachery was taken into account, the outcome turned out to be peaceful and civilized.
 

 
The production team was quite pleased with this development.
 

 
“Not bad, starting to feel like a proper survival show.”
 

 
Director Chen finally felt a bit of relief. “This feels right.”
 

 
As the show seemed to be getting on the right track, the staff could relax slightly. As for the contestant who had been eliminated early, well, they just chalked it up to bad luck!
 

 
“By the way, what’s Tong Zhao doing?”
 

 
Just as the words fell, the director switched the main screen to focus on the exploited imperial assassin, Duan Ge.
 

 
After the other contestants had found supplies, they followed human instinct and hid indoors, where they felt safe. Meanwhile, Duan Ge, who was still hungry and thirsty, managed to find the last two bottles of mineral water on a nearby supermarket shelf.
 

 
That's right—there were still a few remaining resources in Jinan City.
 

 
However, they were hard to find, requiring contestants to take the risk of running into other teams or being caught by the assassin while out searching.
 

 
How did Duan Ge just happen to find them in the nearby supermarket?
 

 
Was this a moral awakening or the production team growing a conscience?
 

 
No, it was neither.
 

 
It was because AI had scanned that Duan Ge, who was suffering from thirst and on the verge of losing her temper, had decided to return to the McDonald's nearby, intending to cut open the bodies while they were still fresh to drink blood...
 

 
To avoid airing such a graphic scene, Director Chen had hastily added two sets of mineral water into her path, hoping to calm her down.
 

 
The two bottles of water somewhat appeased Duan Ge.
 

 
She then found a high vantage point to overlook the city.
 

 
While contestants had supply points, hunters like Duan Ge also had special privileges. Her privilege was being able to choose the gas drop location an hour before the toxic gas was released. The range and timing of the gas drop were decided by the production team, but the exact location within Jinan City was up to her.
 

 
Duan Ge took only ten minutes to finalize her plan.
 

 
It wasn’t difficult.
 

 
She would wait near the edge of the gas, waiting for the right target to appear. It was like fishing on the edge of the shrinking zone in PUBG—wait, and you'll catch someone. As the safe area shrank, even if she was unlucky, she had mapped out three main routes on the map. All she had to do was watch from her high perch.
 

 
"They didn't even give me a military-grade binocular…”
 

 
Duan Ge muttered quietly in complaint.
 

 
Those escapees were way too poor—none of them had any useful resources on them.
 

 
[Our girl is the poorest assassin in history!]
 

 
[The production team has no heart.]
 

 
[No, think about it—if they actually gave her a full assassin's kit, the other teams would probably already be wiped out. This show could go straight to casting for the next season = =]
 

 
The audience laughed while agreeing this made sense.
 

 
While Duan Ge in the show struggled with her lack of resources, outside the show, a video of Tong Zhao single-handedly taking down four people was edited by devoted fans and uploaded to Weibo. Her agent, Sister Chu, had been keeping a close eye on things and wasn’t about to miss such a golden opportunity for promotion. She quickly paid for big influencers and some PR pieces to boost the video.
 

 
@VarietyShowReviewsV:
 

 
I have to share this hidden gem of a variety show, “One Life Survivor”! Less than 15 minutes into the episode, and four contestants are already eliminated. Can you guess who the killer is?
 

 
[Video]
 

 
This post hit the target audience perfectly.
 

 
Since the fight scene was so short, the video posted by the marketing account was a combination of two clips: the original and a slow-motion version. In slow motion, you could clearly see how Tong Zhao had taken down four opponents in such a short time. Some people who hadn’t been following the entertainment industry but remembered liking Tong Zhao’s previous work were immediately intrigued:
 

 
[Whoa? Is this a variety show? This clip gives off serious Feng Yanqi vibes.]
 

 
[Mind blown!!! So cool!!!!]
 

 
[Oh please, is this supposed to be impressive? If Tong Zhao fought me, she’d be begging me not to die within five seconds*.]
 

 
[The person above... your mom's dumplings are really delicious.]
 

 
The scene of Tong Zhao taking on four opponents was incredibly entertaining, something rare in Chinese entertainment—at least in variety shows. Once people explained the context behind it in the top comments, the post got even more traction and was shared widely.
 

 
Her agent, Sister Chu, monitored the data feedback and nodded in satisfaction.
 

 
The money spent had brought back substantial returns, which made perfect sense.
 

 
Great content + a well-managed entertainment company = success.
 

 
Everything had progressed logically up to this point.
 

 
However, just as the agent closed the chat to attend to another artist's matters, the assistant she had been in contact with suddenly started messaging frantically again.
 

 
What now?
 

 
Sister Chu, puzzled, opened the chat:
 

 
[Something big happened!!!]
 

 
[Because the fans allowed reposts, that clip got shared on international platforms. A lot of people from overseas are asking who this girl is and whether this is the legendary Chinese martial arts! (Twitter screenshot) The response is huge, even the National Martial Arts Institute posted a Weibo about it… (Weibo screenshot)]
 

 
Just seeing the number of shares on those two screenshots made the agent snap to attention.
 

 
This was basically an example of something becoming a hit abroad and then being re-imported to the domestic market.
 

 
In the West, there's often a preference for Japanese culture when it comes to Asian content—things like “Dragon Ball” are right up their alley.
 

 
China's primary cultural export is martial arts, which remains popular worldwide, thanks to iconic stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, who opened the door for international audiences and left a lasting impression.
 

 
Chinese fight scenes are incredibly captivating!
 

 
Even as traditional cinema fades and action blockbusters dominate, martial arts choreography continues to thrive, with Chinese martial arts films remaining in high demand.
 

 
However, the video of Tong Zhao circulating on international platforms is something different.
 

 
This wasn’t from a movie?
 

 
It was from reality TV?
 

 
Was there an action choreographer involved?
 

 
The person who reposted it kindly answered the curious netizens—no, there was no action choreography; it’s a survival-themed reality show, and the girl’s name is Tong Zhao, a Chinese celebrity!
 

 
The hashtag “#TheGirlWhoFoughtFourOnRealityTV” started gaining moderate attention across North American and European networks. Although Tong Zhao's fighting skills weren’t traditional martial arts—just something she’d honed through rough survival training—it didn’t matter. Her incredibly beautiful East Asian face in front of the camera, combined with the fact that she was Chinese, sealed the deal.
 

 
No problem! It was ‘definitely’ Chinese kung fu!
 

 
Most foreign comments humorously agreed that Chinese kung fu is real.
 

 
Childhood dreams weren’t shattered, and they joked that it would be perfect if a panda appeared as well.
 

 
Chinese students abroad reacted, “Damn, there’s no way we can explain this to foreigners anymore.”
 

 
But despite the confusion, everyone was pretty happy.
 

 
After all, people from every country share a common trait: they love hearing foreigners praise their own people.
 

 
Since it was vaguely related to martial arts, the National Martial Arts Institute jumped on the bandwagon, re-importing the clip to Chinese social media by posting a screenshot from Twitter.
 

 
@NationalMartialArtsInstituteV:
 

 
New-style Chinese Kung Fu! /Laugh and cry/Laugh and cry
 

 
Miss Tong, are you interested in joining our institute?
 

 
This National Martial Arts Institute isn’t like the many fake institutions that use the guise of traditional culture to scam students. Whether in the era of traditional films or the era of instinctive action movies, the top martial arts choreographers and action designers all come from this institute’s masters and students. It is well-known in the film industry, and in recent years, more than 80% of martial arts stars have either graduated from or trained at this institute.
 

 
Their official social media account is not managed by any PR team. In fact, it’s run by the old headmaster himself, who, after learning how to type with one finger, personally posts updates.
 

 
This was basically the grandmaster speaking.
 

 
In the martial arts community, the concept of master and disciple is significant, so naturally:
 

 
- "Are we getting a new junior sister?"
 
- "I really want a junior sister!"
 
- "I just happen to need a female lead for my new film."
 

 
At first glance, these replies seemed like ordinary fan comments...
 

 
But upon closer inspection, they were all verified gold accounts, and all belonged to famous actors, action designers, and directors in the martial arts film industry. Any one of them could provide invaluable resources to newcomers aspiring to enter the world of action films.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, this wasn’t particularly enticing since she was already in a position where she could choose roles at will.
 

 
The problem was the surge in popularity that followed, propelling this short video to the number one spot on trending topics.
 

 
#JuniorSisterTongZhao#
 

 
Manager Chu scrolled through the replies, overwhelmed by the buzz.
 

 
Especially the top comment—director Shi Dingjun, who said he was looking for a female lead for his new film…
 

 
This famous director had just won an international award with his last movie.
 

 
Unlike commercial directors like Shi Qianqiu, who made money from passion projects, Shi Dingjun pursued artistic excellence, particularly in the realm of Chinese martial arts films.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao had piqued his interest?
 

 
Her peers were stunned—who knew that participating in a survival reality show could yield such results!?
# Chapter70
The favor from both the National Martial Arts Academy and Shi Dingjun was like two giant windfalls landing on manager Sister Chu's head. When someone's luck picks up, there's really no stopping it.
 

 
Sister Chu was so pleased that she couldn't contain her smile. She wanted to immediately pull Tong Zhao out of Jinan City and discuss these opportunities with her. Of course, that wasn't possible, so she could only send her a WeChat message. She was sure Tong Zhao would contact her once she emerged from the holographic filming pod.
 

 
With other artists, things might be uncertain, but Tong Zhao always put her at ease.
 

 
...
 

 
At the same time, within the “One Life Survivor” variety show.
 

 
In Jinan City, the captain of the Sun Team, while searching for possible resources in the city, ran into two members of the Thunder Team at a Walmart. As both sides hesitated, unsure whether to part peacefully or start a fight, the Sun Team captain blurted out, “What the hell?” breaking the tension.
 

 
The Thunder Team realized they could communicate!
 

 
When there's a common language, things become less frightening.
 

 
After some long-distance discussion, the two teams reached an agreement.
 

 
What convinced the Sun Team captain, Kong Yeming, was a single statement: “Think about it. Who said we have to be enemies? Why do we have to fight the moment we meet? Our common enemy should be the military, the assassins sent to eliminate us. We should join forces, survive these remaining fourteen days, and wait for the rescue team to pick us up.”
 

 
To show sincerity, the Thunder Team captain handed his weapon (a stick) to his teammate, then walked over to the Sun Team captain with empty hands, extending his right hand.
 

 
Kong Yeming hesitated for a moment but eventually shook the hand that symbolized cooperation.
 

 
Once the decision was made and physical contact occurred, the atmosphere became noticeably more relaxed.
 

 
The Thunder Team captain invited him to join in the search for supplies, and Kong agreed. As he moved to stand between the two Thunder Team members, he finally got a clear look at the "weapon" that had been handed to the teammate earlier—an old, worn-out baguette.
 

 
Kong Yeming: "This?"
 

 
The Thunder Team captain gave a wry smile. "Couldn't find anything better for defense, so we’re making do with this. It's too hard to eat anyway; I can’t even bite into it."
 

 
To emphasize his point, he picked up the baguette and struck a nearby metal shelf twice. The force of the impact made a loud banging sound, causing the metal shelf to shake slightly, while the baguette remained completely intact. It was easy to imagine the damage it might cause if swung at someone’s head by an adult man... well, maybe not really.
 

 
[What? A baguette? Is the show serious?]
 

 
[Russian black bread could at least put up a fight!]
 

 
[Lol, such an insult to the French!]
 

 
At that moment, the special effects team added a glowing blue outline around the baguette, accompanied by mechanical sound effects, and a pop-up window displayed its item stats:
 

 
[Name]: A baguette forgotten by customers, staff, and chefs alike.
 
[Expiration date]: One year ago.
 
[Note]: As food, it’s a failed, expired product.
 
As a weapon, it’s an unmatched heavy sword with no edge.
 

 
The item description was clearly a joke.
 

 
Kong Yeming was skeptical, but the Thunder Team members actively shared their findings during their search for supplies— a small amount of medical supplies and food, as a gesture of goodwill. Kong understood that this was an act of kindness and trust, meant to prevent him from having any thoughts of greed or theft, and said, “It just so happens that we have a doctor in our team. If you have any injured members, he might be able to help.”
 

 
The Thunder Team was delighted.
 

 
Although none of them were injured at the moment, having a medical professional was certainly valuable.
 

 
Kong Yeming continued, “You guys are lucky you didn’t run into anyone else. We went to a McDonald's, and we almost got into a fight there…”
 

 
He recounted what had happened that day and then expressed a concern he hadn’t mentioned to his teammates before: “I’m pretty sure that once we ran out of McDonald’s, they didn’t follow us. That doesn’t make sense; after all, we’re not fast runners, and they were willing to use force to fight over food. Would they really be the type to give up just because we left the restaurant? We didn’t run far. I wanted to go back and take a look, but I felt it wasn’t worth the risk.”
 

 
“I think we should go back and check it out.”
 

 
The Thunder Team captain confirmed Kong’s concern: “If they’re in danger, it’s something we’ll need to face together.”
 

 
[That’s right, if your team runs into Tong Zhao, you’ll get wiped out.]
 

 
[If the two teams cooperate, Tong Zhao will be in danger; the remaining Moon and Star teams should also be able to unite. They managed to split supplies even when they couldn't communicate, so it should be easier now that they can.]
 

 
[Everyone targeting Zhao Zhao, and she can only eat instant noodles without seasoning packets.]
 

 
The two teams agreed to meet at that McDonald's the next morning at eight o'clock, after which they would search for supplies together.
 

 
With eight people working together, safety would be increased.
 

 
When Kong Yeming returned to the gathering place and spoke to his teammates, the members of the Sun Team, with the exception of Tan Jie, were usually indecisive and always followed his lead, so there were no objections this time.
 

 
The next morning at eight o'clock.
 

 
On the empty street, the two groups met right on time at the corner across from McDonald's. He Su from the Sun Team took the initiative to chat and lighten the mood as they crossed the street together. After all, the two teams had never had any conflicts, and under He Su's cheerful laughter, the atmosphere felt as relaxed as a high school field trip.
 

 
However, just ten meters from the entrance of McDonald's…
 

 
A wave of putrid stench surged into their nostrils, leaving everyone in shock.
 

 
What was that smell?
 

 
The team's mood-lifter, He Su, couldn't help but turn away and cover his mouth, gagging, while Sister Tan also changed her expression.
 

 
She knew what was causing the smell.
 

 
[Warning ahead! Protect yourselves!]
 

 
[Bros who are scared, put up your shields on the screen.]
 

 
[What’s there to be afraid of? Those corpses are just code; the real ones have probably woken up and are watching the livestream!]
 

 
The third comment was on point.
 

 
The entire Cloud Team, which had been wiped out, theoretically could be reintroduced into the reality show because their contract hadn’t expired yet. Director Chen hadn’t decided if there would be any opportunities for them to be useful again, so they were kept around to do odd jobs in the studio. Naturally, they would see the live broadcast on screen.
 

 
The Cloud Team looked at the close-up of their own corpses with complex feelings.
 

 
The broadcast version was heavily edited (adult viewers could pay to purchase an unedited version), while what they were watching backstage was the high-definition, unedited version.
 

 
The stage manager said, “Oh man, you’re in bad shape.”
 

 
The Cloud Team captain responded nonchalantly, “No, not really; it’s just a bit decayed.”
 

 
Member A asked, “Are there maggots on my face...? Wait, why are you filming me?”
 

 
Member A turned to look at a guy holding a camera filming him. The guy said he thought their conversation was quite interesting and figured that since Member A probably wouldn’t get any screen time on the show, he might as well show his face in the behind-the-scenes footage. Member A thought this was fair and encouraged the guy to film more.
 

 
The Thunder Team also had unpleasant expressions, hesitating.
 

 
Kong Yeming took a deep breath and showed the leadership expected of a captain: “I’ll go in and take a look first.”
 

 
No one objected.
 

 
He stepped inside, and through the glass door, he could already see a horrific scene.
 

 
Kong Yeming furrowed his brow and opened the door; the stench intensified, making his eyes water.
 

 
After all, it was an enclosed space with poor air circulation, and things were decaying rapidly, creating a strong odor.
 

 
A comment quietly floated by: [Fermentation is on point...]
 

 
[To the one who said “fermentation on point,” what kind of devil are you? I’ll gag in respect.]
 

 
[Is the little girl chasing after Tong Zhao scared off by the survival show's standards?]
 

 
There were definitely points that could provoke a debate. Goodness.
 

 
The girls were already a bit intimidated; who wouldn’t be? Even some of the guys were afraid of corpses, but now with the provocations, Tong Zhao's fans couldn’t sit still and began to retaliate: [What’s there to be scared of? This is an artwork made by my sister; we’re lucky to be able to appreciate it!]
 

 
[Exactly! With a filter, it’s just like other female stars posting pictures of their handmade cookies on Weibo.]
 

 
The love from these fangirls was incredibly strong!
 

 
Some particularly proactive fans even took screenshots of the blurred corpses, added a dreamy pink filter, and included them in Tong Zhao's collection of highlighted works. They used their actions to prove that the stereotype of women being timid was outdated. What’s there to be afraid of? They loved Tong Zhao, who even created the corpses, so what were a few more corpses to them?
 

 
Fangirls were not afraid of corpses.
 

 
The two teams in the variety show were genuinely scared.
 

 
Even someone like Sister Tan, a healthcare professional who was used to seeing cadavers during her studies, felt her grip tighten and chills run down her back when she thought about the presence behind the “creation” of these corpses.
 

 
Kong Yeming pinched his nose to reduce his breathing and crouched down to examine the state of the bodies.
 

 
He Su, who had finally managed to suppress his gag reflex, said, “Ugh, Captain, what’s so interesting about this?!”
 

 
The captain ignored him.
 

 
After a while, he signaled his teammates to follow him out onto the street, returning to the embrace of fresh air. He took several deep breaths to expel the faint stench of decay and said, “The fatal wound is in the throat; there are no other obvious external injuries. They were all killed by having their throats cut.”
 

 
The members of the Lightning Team looked at him with newfound respect. “Are you a forensic doctor?”
 

 
“No, just a loyal “CSI viewer.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Alright then.
 

 
Kong Yeming cleared his throat and analyzed the situation: “In other words, when we had the conflict with them, there was a third party in McDonald’s that I didn’t notice. They must have attacked them after we left the store.”
 

 
“The wounds are clean; the attackers were human.”
 

 
The captain of the Lightning Team nodded thoughtfully.
 

 
“The supplies are in my hands. If it were another team, they should be consistently pursuing us. Clearly, the ones who attacked them must be the enemy’s lackeys.”
 

 
Kong Yeming’s analysis received high praise from the audience in the live stream.
 

 
So far, everything he said was correct, and he had even guessed the identity of the murderer.
 

 
[Not bad, Mr. Kong, lucky and smart; you might just survive to the end.]
 

 
[I feel like the Lightning Team wants to side with him now.]
 

 
“I believe that the intelligence about the reinforcements was wrong, or the enemy has changed their mind,” Kong Yeming continued.
 

 
Kong Yeming's tone shifted, becoming grave: “The enemy’s lackeys are not just one; they’re not a single person but a team. That’s why they were able to take out four people in such a short amount of time! This isn’t a brawl or a fight; it’s a cold, ruthless execution. We’re in danger!”
 

 
His words jolted everyone awake from their stupor.
 

 
Yes, it was unreasonable to send just one person to wipe out twenty survivors.
 

 
With such a disparity in numbers, who would kill whom?
 

 
There must be a scheme behind this!
 

 
…
 

 
[Uh…]
 

 
[Correct reasoning process leading to the wrong conclusion.]
 

 
[Actually, it’s not really wrong; Tong Zhao alone is like an army. Is there a problem with that?]
 

 
[No problem; you’re very right.]
 

 
Understanding this point, Kong Yeming felt that uniting the other teams was now an urgent task.
 

 
At this moment, the camera suddenly pulled up, higher and higher…
 

 
Up to the edge of a rooftop of a tall building.
 

 
The first thing visible on screen were two long, perfectly white legs, creating a strong visual contrast with the pure black military boots. The camera pulled up further, revealing a pair of always bright and alert beautiful eyes coming into the audience's view.
 

 
It was her.
 

 
Duan Ge gently swayed her legs, beneath her a bottomless abyss, a maze of complex buildings, as if a single misstep would result in a fatal fall. Yet she appeared oblivious to it all, enjoying the cool breeze high above.
 

 
Everything in The City was still; there was no traffic, no throngs of people. Those walking through this city were undoubtedly her targets. Duan Ge once again occupied a high vantage point and spotted Kong Yeming and his group.
 

 
Duan Ge's eyes lit up, narrowing slightly as she tried to see more clearly.
 

 
But she was not Superman; no matter how hard she strained her eyes, she could only see the vague movement of ants.
 

 
Duan Ge whispered in frustration, “If only I had binoculars.”
 

 
Forget it, relying on the boss was not as good as relying on herself.
 

 
After locating her target, Duan Ge skillfully took a route that the audience could hardly imagine, dashing down. Just when the audience thought she was fearless enough to go anywhere, she chose a safer path while passing through an apartment.
 

 
[Eh? I thought she would jump straight across.]
 

 
Just as the audience was puzzled, the special effects team pulled up a small box.
 

 
In a picture-in-picture format, they replayed Tong Zhao's perspective, and the audience then realized—
 

 
From Tong Zhao's viewpoint, no matter how bumpy it got, running up and down, or jumping between two buildings, members of the Thunder and Sun teams were always within her line of sight.
 

 
The earlier adjustment of the route was not for safety but to avoid losing sight of her prey.
 

 
[Wow, that line of thought is quite terrifying.]
 

 
[Kong, hurry up and run!]
 

 
After exchanging information, Kong Yeming and his group illuminated their “spawn points” on the map displayed on their watches, realizing that the distance to both their spawn points and supply points was the same. They deduced that the remaining two teams’ bases wouldn’t be too far away.
 

 
They needed to find them without being discovered by the enemy…
 

 
Kong Yeming's eyes lit up: “Right, the resource package!”
 

 
He Su: “Captain?”
 

 
“The resource packages that the reinforcements drop irregularly; the drop points are known only to our five teams. We can meet there when the time comes.”
 

 
Everyone nodded in agreement; it made sense.
 

 
The female doctor was troubled by the doubts: “In my memory, the five teams couldn’t communicate because they were from different countries. I didn’t expect that when we actually met, we could communicate. The irregularly dropped resource packages also carry the implication that we should fight over them. I suspect there’s a conspiracy behind this.”
 

 
[Sister Tan is absolutely right; it’s all the fault of the dog program team.]
 

 
[Feeling sympathy for the program team for a second; the originally planned map had a bug, and in the last-minute switch, Tong Zhao, this big weapon, popped up.]
 

 
[Who would have thought Tong Zhao’s subconscious would be so fierce?]
 

 
No one thought so.
 

 
This is the interesting aspect of instinctive variety shows; the program team is not all-knowing and omnipotent. Even if they can temporarily change the rules, they cannot alter the memories in the contestants’ minds. They cannot achieve the dominion of “with the script in hand, I hold the world.” This is also one of the reasons fans find instinctive variety shows more authentic and appealing than before.
 

 
The camera pulled back again.
 

 
The camera pulled back slowly, not causing any visual discomfort, but the audience, prepared psychologically, was still startled—
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao was hanging not far behind Kong Yeming and his group!
 

 
This was in a physical sense.
 

 
She hooked onto the railing from a height and swung down, her toes landing on the huge golden “M” sign of McDonald’s. After steadying her position, she fluidly climbed down. In just two or three seconds, she reached the ground, her snowy white arms demonstrating an inexplicable strength.
 

 
A parkour-loving audience member provided some insights about core strength.
 

 
[Core strength refers to the muscles that support our upright posture. If this part is well-trained… you know about swinging your legs on parallel bars, right? That’s using core strength. Tong Zhao is the same; many of her amazing parkour moves rely on her core. Her techniques and postures while doing parkour are very standard—any extra movement is wasted, and if it’s not precise, she won’t get through. It’s incredible.]
 

 
[I shared her in our city’s parkour group, and it has now turned into a fan group for Tong Zhao. “laughs and cries”]
 

 
Netizens seemed to understand, but in any case, she was awesome!
 

 
[Tong Zhao is so popular now; if she goes out without a mask, she’ll probably be photographed. I really want to know how she trains her parkour skills while being so busy with her schedules…] The comments showed envy.
 

 
How does she train?
 

 
All the real skills were honed at the brink of life and death, and they couldn’t be forgotten.
 

 
Tong Zhao herself didn’t remember clearly due to the system’s protective measures for her consciousness—if we were to liken Tong Zhao to a computer, her main personality would be the C drive, containing only the necessary content, while the other assorted skills would be stored in her sub-personality, lightening the load.
 

 
With her toes on the asphalt road, Duan Ge turned her gaze toward the prey.
 

 
Light enveloped her, casting a gentle halo around her.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I can’t understand what they’re saying.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [There are so many people; it’s a bit difficult to take action, so I’ll just follow them.]
 

 
In the audience’s imagination, following meant something very animated, like hiding behind a telephone pole and trailing along step by step.
 

 
But Duan Ge’s tracking was not like that.
 

 
She only ensured that those people remained in her line of sight; everything else was irrelevant. She didn’t mind lagging far behind, fluctuating between distance and closeness, filled with patience. Following and sniping are both disciplines that test one’s patience. There will always be answers at the end of tracking; if there aren’t, then you shouldn’t have embarked on this path in the first place.
 

 
Sometimes the audience felt anxious for her, but she remained unhurried, maintaining a distance that wouldn’t raise suspicion.
 

 
Duan Ge saw them arrive at the Julong residences, then change locations, and finally come to a primary school with two boxes of supplies—
 

 
This was the third supply point.
 

 
It was also the place where Star Team and Moon Team completed their transaction through gestures.
 

 
Originally, avoiding other teams meant they shouldn’t have come to such a place, but now their target had shifted, and using a supply point where other teams might come looking as a base was Captain Kong Yeming’s suggestion. Moreover, a primary school was itself a good choice… it was more reliable for escape or defense than residential buildings and had more places to hide supplies.
 

 
……
 

 
After a day of busyness…
 

 
Although they didn’t find new food sources, everyone took a portable gas stove, a frying pan, and some gas canisters from Walmart, deciding to heat the food in the cans before eating.
 

 
“No matter how hard life gets, we still need a sense of ritual.”
 

 
He Su rubbed his fists in anticipation.
 

 
“Yeah, we can find food again. Since Brother Zhang found a baguette that expired a year ago in the bakery, it shows that finding resources in Canaan City isn’t hopeless,” said Team Lightning member A, agreeing. “Besides, there are eight of us. How could we possibly lose when competing for the airdrop supply packages?”
 

 
Kong Yeming smoothed things over, saying, “Let’s try to unite everyone first; after all, we don’t know the number of enemy lackeys.”
 

 
“Stop talking about that. Let’s just throw in a few slices of lunch meat!”
 

 
The lunch meat slid onto the heated frying pan with a sizzle, releasing fat and filling the air with an irresistible aroma that captivated everyone present. He Su took a deep breath and sighed, “It’s true that lunch meat tastes better when it’s fried. Yesterday, eating cold bread with cold meat made my heart feel cold too.”
 

 
“Yeah, it was really hard to eat.”
 

 
“You talk too much. The first slice is yours, okay?”
 

 
Seeing that the lunch meat was nearly done frying, Kong Yeming picked up a piece and stuffed it into a sliced piece of bread before handing it to He Su.
 

 
He was starving, so he took the bread and started munching on it.
 

 
The edges of the pan-fried lunch meat were crispy, but biting into it revealed tender meat inside. The hot grease seeped into the fluffy white bread, making it so delicious that it made him feel as if his soul had left his body.
 

 
In survival variety shows, this kind of gathering to eat rare food is a classic scene that many variety show fans love. It looks especially appetizing and allows them to reflect on the difficulties of survival.
 

 
The sizzling sound of frying meat made everyone’s mouths water.
 

 
The oil and meat aroma intertwined, accompanied by wisps of white steam slowly rising…
 

 
Rising.
 

 
It reached the ventilation duct in the ceiling.
 

 
Duan Ge crouched in the ventilation pipe and looked down.
 

 
The view from the school auditorium was too open for her to follow closely behind, so she chose to sneak through the ventilation duct to see the situation. If anyone was alone, she could take the chance to eliminate them. Unfortunately, there had been no opportunity; they even went to the restroom together, likely already on guard.
 

 
She had a feeling she would be out for a long time today, so even though she was really dissatisfied with the instant noodles her boss had given her, she still took them along and stuffed them into her waist pouch. To her surprise, this group was getting carried away and actually started frying meat!
 

 
This was outrageous!
 

 
The aroma shot straight to Duan Ge's head, making her feel a little defensive and wanting to jump down and kill them all.
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m so angry.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Stay calm. There are too many people; I can’t take them on.]
 

 
Duan Ge was very rational.
 

 
After all, this wasn’t a world of magic and martial arts; she wasn’t a terrifyingly powerful fighting master. Her slender and agile figure was better suited for ambushes and assassinations.
 

 
[Hahaha, it’s really tragic!]
 

 
[The bunny is furious!]
 

 
[When a rabbit is cornered, it will bite! So what if she can’t win? She can still jump down and go all out!]
 

 
That was impossible.
 

 
Even if she faced four opponents, it wouldn’t make her heart race. It was just a hot meal; what did that count for? Duan Ge turned over, facing away from the ground, and pulled out a cup of Master Kong instant noodles from the dark ventilation duct…
 

 
Fortunately, this time she finally had a seasoning packet.
 

 
Below, there were sounds of laughter and joy, while above, there was a crackle of crispness.
# Chapter71
After finishing the instant noodles, Duan Ge fell into serious contemplation.
 

 
She was considering the possibility of slitting their throats one by one after they fell asleep.
 

 
But Kong Yeming was quite cautious. He didn’t leave only one person on watch but insisted that two people stand guard, with one person from the Thunder Squad and one from the Sun Squad each time: "Not only can they chat and bond, but it also improves safety."
 

 
“I have no issue with chatting, sounds nice,”
 

 
He Su, who loved to talk, scratched his head. “But usually, only one person keeps watch, right?”
 

 
“There are too many unexpected situations if it’s just one person.”
 

 
Kong Yeming shook his head.
 

 
Everyone trusted his judgment completely, and no one objected.
 

 
So, Duan Ge waited for a while, watching as they ate until they were full, using bread to soak up the gravy and finishing the canned food completely. She waited until they covered themselves with the backstage theater props and tried to sleep... but two tall men still remained awake, sitting to the side and chatting.
 

 
Duan Ge: [With two people standing guard, setting fire in the auditorium is also not an option.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [My biggest advantage right now is that they are in the open, while I am in the shadows. They still don’t know I’m nearby. Unless I can ensure a reduction in their numbers with one strike, I can’t act rashly and alert them.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is so pitiful, it really broke my defenses watching him. Can’t they give the kid something good to eat?]
 

 
[Why not sneak down and steal some food?]
 

 
[Congrats to both teams for successfully avoiding a death flag.]
 

 
Did they really avoid it?
 

 
In the middle of the night, the Thunder Squad's guard urgently needed to use the bathroom. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he mentioned it to the Sun Squad’s guard before getting up to go. By then, everyone who should have been asleep was in a deep slumber, and only a few dedicated viewers were still watching the livestream.
 

 
One advantage of a 24-hour live-stream variety show is that it’s great for night owls to keep on in the background. Many “urban immortals” who stay up all night working or gaming like to keep interesting live streams playing in a small window, glancing at them only when something exciting happens.
 

 
Going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, an everyday action, didn’t catch much attention from the audience.
 

 
The restroom was just outside the primary school auditorium, down the corridor. If the door was open, a shout could be heard immediately in the stillness of the night.
 

 
The other guard chose to stay by the sleeping teammates, urging him to be quick and continue their earlier conversation: "When you get back, I’ll tell you about my second girlfriend."
 

 
The Thunder Squad guard didn’t turn around but raised his hand, signaling an OK gesture.
 

 
After stepping outside, his pace faltered. An inexplicable sixth sense made him stop. He looked ahead—clouds had covered the moon, cutting off the only source of natural light. The pitch-black corridor looked like the gaping maw of some monster, and the night wind blowing through the railings should have made it cool and comfortable.
 

 
But the guard felt as if he had stepped into a mass of jelly.
 

 
His legs felt rooted to the ground, and he hesitated to take another step forward.
 

 
Instinct was telling him not to go any further.
 

 
But compared to the vague sixth sense, the urgency from his full bladder was more convincing. The Thunder Squad guard shook his head, laughing at himself inwardly, thinking he had been overly cautious due to Kong Yeming’s influence.
 

 
His silhouette disappeared into the darkness.
 

 
A slender shadow flashed by, hanging outside the railing.
 

 
Everything happened too quickly.
 

 
So fast that if the show didn’t provide a replay, viewers who weren’t paying attention to the livestream would have completely missed it. A dagger sliced through his throat and vocal cords effortlessly, like cutting through soft tofu. There was no need for light to precisely find the vital point of the prey. The dagger was the assassin’s fang, sinking into the throat with a single, lethal strike.
 

 
“Ugh...!”
 

 
A brief cry barely escaped before it was reduced to a whisper.
 

 
In terror and panic, the Thunder Squad guard tried to make a sound to warn his teammates, to call for help, but it was already too late. The assassin lurking in the dark had anticipated this, giving him no chance to utter another word.
 

 
[An Imperial Assassin is not interested in hearing any pleas from their prey.]
 

 
Another fatality, and the special effects team immediately released the poetic closing line they had long prepared.
 

 
[The show’s crew really puts effort into creating the right atmosphere.]
 

 
[This style is amazing, I’m saving this as my signature!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [It seemed like he wanted to say something?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Oh well, even if he did, I wouldn’t have understood it anyway.]
 

 
[...Our Tong Zhao is really committed to ruining the mood.]
 

 
[Rabbits shouldn’t refer to themselves as “laozi”!]
 

 
[Cover the rabbit’s mouth >w<]
 

 
Since it was the middle of the night, even though the show provided a replay, the number of comments in the live chat was minimal, allowing for relaxed conversations. Yet, among the few comments, about a third were in English: [Is this Tong Zhao? (in English)], [Cool!!!!!!!], [I’ve only seen moves like this in ‘Naruto’; if she had a kunai, it would be even better (in English)], and [Shut up, this is Chinese Kung Fu, not Japanese ninjutsu!].
 

 
Thanks to the advanced translation software of this era, a simple click would display translated content.
 

 
Though not always elegant, the translation was accurate enough.
 

 
The Chinese viewers still watching the stream were shocked.
 

 
They wanted to say…
 

 
Actually, this is neither Japanese ninjutsu nor Chinese Kung Fu!
 

 
What misunderstanding do you have about Chinese Kung Fu?
 

 
The Thunder Squad guard, who had his throat slit, struggled fiercely. However, Duan Ge used all her strength to shoulder-check him into the cold wall. The collision of flesh and wall made no sound, and he breathed his last in unwillingness. Duan Ge held up the tall man with both hands, preventing the loud noise of his body hitting the ground. She slowly placed him against the wall, sitting him in a pool of his own blood.
 

 
Whew, whew...
 

 
An assassin is no bodybuilder—while she could deliver precise and deadly attacks in a short time, moving a heavy human body still took considerable effort.
 

 
It was such a terrifying task to deal with a corpse—
 

 
Yet, when she did it, why did it somehow feel like a cute little bunny struggling to pull out a giant carrot?
 

 
The blood splattered from his artery formed bright red blossoms against the wall.
 

 
Duan Ge bent down for a moment, taking the watch and glasses off the man's wrist.
 

 
In the pitch-black environment, only her eyes glowed faintly.
 

 
That tiny glimmer of light sent a chill through the hearts of all the night owls watching, jolting them wide awake.
 

 
The assassin's reflection appeared in the restroom mirror.
 

 
At some point, the clouds had drifted away from the moon, and moonlight poured through the door. She quickly turned her head, the light tracing her high-bridged nose and slightly pouted lips, making her look like a mysterious and dangerous yet beautiful creature.
 

 
The assassin, with a displeased expression, let out a soft grunt.
 

 
Duan Ge: [That's what you get for eating meat.]
 

 
After silently eliminating one person, Duan Ge left without a sound and returned upstairs to resume her short nap.
 

 
...
 

 
Twenty minutes passed, and the other guard, He Su, began to sense something was off when the man didn’t return.
 

 
In such dangerous times, even if someone had diarrhea, they should still hurry back!
 

 
"Why is he taking so long…"
 

 
At that moment, He Su's instincts saved his life.
 

 
Instead of getting up and rushing out to investigate, he chose to wake up his captain, Kong Yeming. This small disturbance also woke up the Thunder Squad members, who hadn’t slept well. They rubbed their bleary eyes as He Su explained the situation. Some teased him for being overly cautious while they got up to check the restroom together.
 

 
What they found was a floor covered in fresh blood and their teammate’s corpse.
 

 
Everyone turned pale and, leaning against the walls, vomited violently.
 

 
The meat they ate that night ended up being for nothing.
 

 
On the other floor, Duan Ge, hearing the commotion, curved her lips into a smile, revealing a satisfied expression in her sleep.
 

 
Unable to control his emotions, He Su yelled, “If you have the guts, come out! Hiding and ambushing doesn’t make you a hero! Aren’t there a lot of you? Come out!”
 

 
Duan Ge turned over in her sleep.
 

 
Duan Ge: [So lively.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [They must be really full for their voices to be so loud.]
 

 
Kong Yeming said, “Let’s get some rest first. Only when we’re well-rested can we fight back.”
 

 
With death threats lurking nearby, no one dared to ignore Kong Yeming’s words anymore. The strong men huddled together, trembling, and even Sister Tan was treated like a cherished pet, protected on the inside. His decision was indeed correct. Duan Ge exerted psychological pressure while ensuring she could eliminate members. Continuous sleep deprivation would dull people’s reactions and lead to poor decisions, which could be fatal in close-quarters combat.
 

 
Duan Ge enjoyed a good, restful sleep.
 

 
...
 

 
In the later edited version, the production team carefully cut this segment of the kill.
 

 
It turned out that after everyone settled down to rest and decided to have two people keep watch, Duan Ge went upstairs to the corridor on the second floor to rest. She was a light sleeper, waking up at the slightest noise. When someone passed by downstairs, she immediately woke up, flipped down like a bat, and truly achieved the feat of killing one person in ten steps.
 

 
When Director Chen woke up in the morning and checked the high-energy segments from the night, a chill ran down his neck, leaving him speechless.
 

 
If it weren't for the control panel nearby, allowing him to intervene in the variety show world at any time…
 

 
This was practically a crime scene.
 

 
What kind of subconscious has he invited?
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really not a fugitive hiding in the entertainment industry?
 

 
The assistant director voiced what everyone was thinking: “Should we… call the police?”
 

 
“Call the police for what?!”
 

 
Director Chen summoned his fist, ready to attack, and punched the assistant director lightly. “It’s just a variety show! How long has Tong Zhao’s face been popular in the country? If she were a fugitive, how could she have escaped until now? It must be that our script is just too good and fits her perfectly!”
 

 
While the assistant director obediently took the hit, he secretly reminded himself not to provoke this female star.
 

 
She was too scary!
 

 
...
 

 
Kong Yeming and the others worked hard to sleep, but they didn’t rest well.
 

 
Duan Ge, on the other hand, had a good rest and woke up early, stirred by her superior’s message—
 

 
“Based on your known intelligence, choose a location for the gas deployment!”
 

 
The modified phone, now stripped down to only its essential functions, alerted her that she could choose a location for the gas deployment.
 

 
Duan Ge calculated the time and figured that the survivors in the school should be waking up soon. The possibility of them being poisoned in their sleep was low... However, she still held onto the thoughts of “what if” and “it doesn’t hurt to try,” deciding to deploy the gas at this school.
 

 
She skillfully crawled back into the ventilation duct, lying prone at a small window in the ceiling to observe below.
 

 
With half an hour left until deployment, their watches, tucked away in Duan Ge's waist pouch, lit up.
 

 
Duan Ge pulled out the vibrating watch—
 

 
This was the watch she had taken off the Thunder Squad guard's wrist last night, and it was now displaying a miniature map of Canaan City, with a red dot flashing. After double-tapping to zoom in, she saw that the red dot indicated the location of the school.
 

 
Immediately after, she saw the fugitives below hurriedly packing supplies and belongings, preparing to leave.
 

 
Hmm?
 

 
Duan Ge tilted her head slightly.
 

 
The special effects team had placed a small light bulb above her head.
 

 
Duan Ge: [Has the information leaked...?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Receiving news half an hour early means this gas deployment won’t be lethal. Unless I can create a sealed room they can’t escape from... Ah, I realized too late. If I had known, I would have figured out how to block all the doors last night.]
 

 
When Duan Ge replayed the situation in her mind, her tone was remarkably calm; she didn’t feel frustrated at all.
 

 
[Tong Zhao is truly the most transcendent variety show guest I’ve ever seen…]
 

 
[I want to see her play a female assassin in a movie QAQ]
 

 
The fact that the fugitives could learn about the gas deployment location half an hour in advance didn’t affect Duan Ge’s confidence at all. She simply noted this time difference for future reference.
 

 
At this point, the Sun Team was down to seven members.
 

 
[Fugitives: 15/20]
 

 
When this data appeared in the upper right corner, a comment popped up in the barrage: [Did Sister Zhao just get a Penta Kill?]
 

 
[Too bad it wasn’t a streak.]
 

 
[But it’s all Solo Kills—impressive!]
 

 
Coincidentally, with the ongoing esports world championship, viewers immediately started discussing and wanted to see Tong Zhao portray an esports player—she displayed the calm and steady demeanor that professional players needed most. It was clear she was a high-level competitor, the kind who wouldn’t lose her cool even in the fifth game.
 

 
As Tong Zhao followed the Sun and Thunder Teams to “run the gas” and change their location ahead of time, the production team behind the scenes confidently shifted their focus to the remaining two teams...
 

 
Not only did they closely monitor the guests' progress, but the entire staff also had to keep track of the competition situation while observing the live stream comments, aiming to stir the audience’s emotions and enhance the entertainment value of the show, setting up dramatic twists while ensuring everything could wrap up neatly.
 

 
The dramatic twist of Tong Zhao instantaneously taking out four people was already enough to satisfy the audience, who were left exhilarated.
 

 
It just nearly couldn’t wrap back up.
 

 
This was also something the director was eager to avoid.
 

 
From the observation cameras, it could be seen that the Star and Moon Teams were back on track.
 

 
They had settled down at locations ten minutes apart. After seeing that the first gas deployment was far from them, they all relaxed, becoming more proactive in searching for supplies. With a large area of Canaan City rendered inactive, the likelihood of conflict with other teams increased.
 

 
The early bird gets the worm.
 

 
Just when it seemed like things were calming down, the production team dropped the first resource supply pack—
 

 
And informed all team members via their watches that this supply pack contained lethal weapons!
 

 
Upon seeing the content on the watch, the Sun Team leader, Kong Yeming, changed his expression.
 

 
In the control room...
 

 
During lunchtime, when the viewership peaked, the director satisfiedly pressed the drop button: “What’s the point of them all settling down? It’s all about creating suspense. If they really unite, there won’t be much excitement left.” From the production team’s perspective, Tong Zhao was capable of killing and winning, but she shouldn’t do it too quickly.
 

 
Facilitating communication between the teams was meant to slow down her killing pace.
 

 
Dropping weapons was not only giving the players the means to resist but also lighting the fuse for conflict.
 

 
It was also a carefully prepared climax for the audience.
 

 
A helicopter slowly flew into the skies above Canaan City.
 

 
All the contestants looked up in unison.
 

 
Once again, standing at a high vantage point, Duan Ge also raised her head, observing the helicopter's flight path, thinking: What is that thing?
 

 
As soon as the thought crossed her mind, she pulled out the gun from her waist.
 

 
It had only one bullet, coming from her unscrupulous boss and the show's "supply resources." She hadn’t used it while killing, thinking it would be a waste of a bullet, but now she took it out without hesitation.
 

 
Seeing this scene, Director Chen's eyes widened: "That’s impossible to hit; this isn’t a movie—there’s no guaranteed hit coding…"
 

 
That's right. In many instinctive films, the “marksmen” and “snipers” have every bullet pre-programmed with automatic navigation codes, enabling them to achieve dramatic, guaranteed hits. Such coding is too detailed and needs to be incorporated early in the world-building; it’s not easy to implement in an instinctive variety show.
 

 
Moreover, the production team didn't want to give Tong Zhao that kind of treatment.
 

 
One dagger and two arrows could take out a team.
 

 
Would they really give her a gun that never misses? As if they thought she wasn’t killing quickly enough?
 

 
However, Duan Ge's marksmanship had withstood countless real-world tests; her physical abilities were slightly above average, and her dynamic vision was comparable to that of a hawk.
 

 
Her eyes narrowed slightly.
 

 
The shot was quick, so quick that the data couldn't be altered in time.
 

 
The shot was loud, loud enough that all the contestants drawn by the helicopter's presence saw this scene.
 

 
A dark figure brought the helicopter down—
 

 
This was obviously impossible.
 

 
It couldn't be done scientifically, nor could it be accomplished in the world of variety shows.
 

 
But the problem was that the knot hanging the supply drop package was a relatively large target. When the helicopter flew low, Duan Ge, standing on the rooftop water tank of the building, was quite close…
 

 
One could only say that Duan Ge's habit of occupying the high ground led the production team to forget about this possibility.
 

 
When that supply package crashed down right in front of Duan Ge, the director gritted his teeth: "Who the hell used a helicopter for a supply drop? Should have used a plane!"
 

 
Modeling Technician: "Uh, didn’t you say that the rental cost for the helicopter model is cheaper, Director?"
 

 
Director: "..."
 

 
He didn’t really expect something to appear at such a height.
 

 
Isn't the show's budget squeezed out by cutting costs here and there?
 

 
Speaking of which, the financial strain was partly due to Duan Ge's somewhat high remuneration.
 

 
"Hiss..."
 

 
The director slapped his forehead.
 

 
At the same time, Duan Ge had already opened the huge box, revealing it was filled to the brim with weapons.
 

 
Duan Ge: "...Wow."
 

 
[Poor Zhao Zhao, suddenly rich like a rabbit!]
 

 
[It’s over, it’s over! The big shot has got a full magazine; how are we going to fight with that?]
 

 
[I’m dying of laughter! Can she really shoot that down? Isn’t this set up by the production team?]
 

 
The livestream timely gave her a close-up.
 

 
Duan Ge's eyes widened brightly as she touched the weapons. Underneath them were military rations, the kind that could heat up with just a little cold water.
 

 
Duan Ge: “This definitely isn’t our military’s supplies.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “It must be from those fugitives…”
 

 
She stood up holding the box, carefully searching for an escape route while seriously contemplating:
 

 
[Is it too late to change jobs now?]
# Chapter72
Where’s the air support drop?
 

 
In the sky, flying, being hoisted by a helicopter, such a large supply drop?
 

 
All the players on the ground looked up, craning their necks in confusion, still unable to figure out what was happening.
 

 
The helicopter, following its pre-set flight path, slowly flew to the planned drop location. In front of the four teams preparing to compete for the supplies, it gradually dropped a long, thick hemp rope that had been broken. The point of impact was charred black, and there was nothing below.
 

 
It was a lonely drop.
 

 
After completing the “drop” motion, the helicopter continued to fly forward.
 

 
He Su shouted, “Hey, there’s nothing here!”
 

 
But this question was clearly in vain.
 

 
The program had no emotions, and the code had no reason.
 

 
The helicopter did not answer his question and continued flying without a hint of feeling.
 

 
He Su, looking hurt, bounced a couple of times in place: “What the heck? Can’t it at least check if the supplies were properly delivered to us? What’s going on with this air support? Totally unreliable! There’s nothing less reliable than our superiors…”
 

 
The captain held him down, signaling him to stop making a fuss.
 

 
The bullet comments responded to his question:
 

 
[Hello, there is.]
 

 
[There’s hot food to eat, and they’re sending weapons. Isn’t that reliable? Much more reliable than the enemy.]
 

 
[So funny, doesn’t the production team consider letting Tong Zhao understand what they’re saying?]
 

 
[I suspect that if Sister Zhao heard it, she’d be so furious that she’d start shooting at all the sharks.]
 

 
The resource supply drop that sparked the dispute was intercepted, and everyone lost their reason to initiate a conflict. Kong Yeming took the initiative to talk to the two teams who looked hesitant, sharing the information he knew and the potential situations they might face, in order to gain their trust.
 

 
Reflecting on the tragic deaths of the Thunder team members, Kong Yeming couldn’t help but feel a bit gloomy: “Looking back now, two people guarding the night really isn’t safe enough.”
 

 
“After all, we don’t have many people; Brother Kong has already thought things through thoroughly.”
 

 
The Thunder team members comforted him in return.
 

 
Kong Yeming waved his hand and continued, “Now that all fifteen of us are gathered here, it means that the person who shot down the supply drop earlier doesn’t belong to our camp. They are likely one of the Empire's lackeys, one of those who killed our team members. Since we were able to learn the location of the gas drop in advance, it’s also possible that they know we have a supply drop coming.”
 

 
“So that person just now…”
 

 
Moon Team member A recalled.
 

 
Everything happened very quickly, and with Duan Ge standing on top of a water tank on a rooftop, it was too high. When they heard the gunshot and looked over, they only caught a fleeting shadow and couldn’t even tell if it was a man or a woman. However, both teams were frightened by Kong Yeming's description of the brutal enemy, and coupled with the incredible marksmanship that seemed to have an aimbot, the team quickly agreed to take action together after a brief discussion.
 

 
The Moon Team agreed, and the Star Team had no choice but to nod and join in.
 

 
This wasn’t because their team names had a sense of harmony or couple dynamics.
 

 
The Star Team captain thought to himself, “If I’m the only one who doesn’t join, wouldn’t our four people become isolated targets? Acting as a group is the safest option.”
 

 
Since the two teams had encountered each other before Director Chen decided to change to a “common language” format, the events that had occurred couldn’t be altered. Thus, the language between the two teams remained unintelligible, and they relied on the remaining survivors to translate.
 

 
From Duan Ge’s perspective, it sounded like a perfectly identical encrypted communication in gibberish.
 

 
It was something akin to “wabi wabi, wabi baba.”
 

 
“After hearing about Mr. Shen's (the fallen Thunder Night Watcher) experiences, I’m too scared to go to the restroom alone,” one member of the Star Team said with a bitter smile.
 

 
Even though these survivors had never directly encountered the assassin, the ominous shadow of terror weighed heavily on their hearts. In Kong Yeming's description, they possessed the combat power to quickly subdue four tall adult men, patiently lurking, and would never engage in prolonged battles after eliminating one target.
 

 
All they had seen were cold corpses; they had never witnessed a fight.
 

 
“This is just like a vengeful spirit…” he whispered.
 

 
At that moment, the live broadcast displayed a line of special effects text in white against a black background:
 

 
“The mysterious assassin no one has ever seen, a predator moving through the darkness…”
 

 
“So, in the imagination of the contestants, what do they think the assassin looks like?”
 

 
Bullet screen: [This way of speaking has a Japanese variety show vibe to it.]
 

 
[The world's poorest assassin!]
 

 
[The rabbit princess reigning over Canaan City?]
 

 
A blue line appeared above the heads of the fifteen contestants, and as they pulled it upward, fifteen scanned images appeared with a swish—
 

 
These images embodied the empire’s assassin as imagined in their minds: muscular and brawny men, a classic bearded killer wearing sunglasses, lean figures that clearly seemed like they could take action, and a few who were too timid to imagine anything, resulting in a mental image of nothing but deep black fog.
 

 
Through the same actions of description, the images that people conjured up could differ vastly.
 

 
However, they all shared one common point…
 

 
[Uh, why are they all male?]
 

 
Among the fifteen scanned images, not a single one depicted a woman.
 

 
In the contestants’ imaginations, they defaulted to the assumption that this powerful and cold assassin was male.
 

 
The live broadcast screen was briefly dominated by question marks and ellipses.
 

 
Stereotypes regarding gender and strength reside deep within people’s hearts; we all know they exist, yet when they are blatantly displayed on the screen, ordinary individuals still feel discomfort. After a moment of unease, the audience began to anticipate their reactions upon finally encountering the assassin in person.
 

 
So, what is the beautiful and handsome assassin sister doing?
 

 
The live camera panned to the top floor of an abandoned industrial building, which was also Duan Ge’s “birth point.”
 

 
A wisp of white mist rose.
 

 
Duan Ge was having a meal.
 

 
She opened two large cans.
 

 
One was sardines in tomato sauce, and the other was a can of luncheon meat.
 

 
Duan Ge placed the fish and meat on top of the self-heating rice, pressing it down tightly, and let it steam for a while. When she opened the lid, the audience was struck by the excessiveness of this meal… the sweet and sour tomato sauce from the sardines seeped into the slightly hard rice, and each bite was filled with meat, the savory flavor coating her entire palate.
 

 
After several consecutive meals of bland, tasteless instant noodles, Duan Ge's sense of taste had almost been neglected.
 

 
This steaming can-topped rice completely awakened her taste buds!
 

 
She ate quietly, without making exaggerated slurping sounds, her brows and eyes subtly curving with happiness, which was incredibly contagious.
 

 
[Ah, this…]
 

 
In that moment, even those who weren’t fans of Tong Zhao could understand her cute point.
 

 
This was clearly a rare instance of a bunny getting a hearty meal!
 

 
With such a cute bunny, why would they let her go hungry? The production team deserves a beating!
 

 
Tong Zhao's looks really can make an impact.
 

 
While fans were being charmed, some passersby couldn't tear their eyes away from the screen, secretly thinking.
 

 
Duan Ge was obviously starving.
 

 
When she ate heartily, her expression was focused and serious, her cheeks bulging with rice and meat, completely contrasting with the cold and capable image she usually projected 90% of the time. If she behaved like this all the time, it would lose its special charm; people are creatures of novelty, needing visual stimulation, and occasionally seeing this kind of side on screen…
 

 
Ah, it's hard to tell whether it's the aroma of the rice or the scent of Tong Zhao.
 

 
...
 

 
After finishing her meal, Duan Ge eagerly began to examine the spoils of this round.
 

 
In the production team's plans, Kong Yeming and his team were supposed to seize the airdrop, gaining weapons and an advantage, slightly tipping the scales in their favor. The airdrop box contained a variety of weapons—
 

 
First was the most common type, a rifle that was easy to use.
 

 
She looked at the three fully loaded magazines in her hand and then at the one bullet her dog-like boss had given her, now already fired from the empty handgun...
 

 
Duan Ge felt a surge of dissatisfaction again.
 

 
There was a very powerful machine gun, and when Duan Ge's fair little hand touched the black firearm, a segment of official commentary appeared:
 

 
“The production team did not provide Tong Zhao with the instructions or usage for these weapons.”
 

 
“Because they were not prepared for her at all...!!”
 

 
The underlying resentment in the words amused the audience.
 

 
But could this really stump Duan Ge?
 

 
Not a chance.
 

 
“This gun has a very fast firing rate; it's a bit unstable, so I need to be careful,” she pondered. “But it’s great for defending a building; it can handle multiple opponents pretty well.”
 

 
The box also contained two sniper rifles and an eight-times scope.
 

 
“If I take this…”
 

 
Duan Ge curled her lips, creating a troubled arc.
 

 
The audience thought she wouldn’t be able to use the sniper rifle.
 

 
“Isn't that a bit unfair?”
 

 
...
 

 
“Alright, I’m willing to call her the strongest force.”
 

 
“If anyone else said that, I’d think they were just trying to show off, but my sister Zhao really can do it.”
 

 
“By the way, didn’t we find out about Tong Zhao’s background before? After seeing all her impressive moves in the reality show, I still think this girl is incredible; she’s not like ordinary people.”
 

 
“I’m a bit confused—did Tong Zhenming raise his daughter with the intent of making her a special forces soldier?”
 

 
Tong Zhenming felt innocent, but he wasn’t entirely sure.
 

 
Because Tong Zhao’s school emphasized “quality education,” she took numerous extracurricular classes. Not to mention the usual ones like piano, violin, tennis, and calligraphy, but some boys were interested in learning shooting. Anyway, he was only responsible for transferring the tuition fees from his card each semester. What if Tong Zhao had learned these things without him knowing? He could only scoff at the thought that she didn’t act like a proper girl.
 

 
Just as the comments were discussing Tong Zhao's background, a line of official special effects text appeared again:
 

 
“Even if you’re cheating, you have to follow the basic rules!”
 

 
“Since this is an exclusive weapon for fugitives, the little thief rabbit is prohibited from using it /heart/heart.”
 

 
The official commentary subtitle was being cute, but the analysis that followed was very serious: “The weapon resources from the reinforcements utilize brand new technology. The fingerprints of all twenty survivors can unlock these weapons, and they cannot be used unless unlocked.”
 

 
“Cold weapons are not subject to this restriction.”
 

 
In other words, although she was restricted from exclusively using these bug-like weapons, she still obtained a crowbar, a crossbow, an axe, and the telescope she had longed for.
 

 
After all, this unexpected operation of intercepting the airdrop was an impressive maneuver that the production team highly recognized. They couldn't simply discourage her enthusiasm for completing the mission but could only secretly adjust the balance.
 

 
...
 

 
The more cute she acted in front of the audience, the more seasoned she was behind the scenes.
 

 
Director Chen lit a cigarette, biting it with satisfaction: “Fortunately, the batch of firearms we rented came with identity verification functions; otherwise, we would have been in serious trouble.”
 

 
“Even humanoid self-driving hacks need to be sanctioned by the officials!”
# Chapter73
Duan Ge quickly discovered the issue with the firearms.
 

 
She had never dealt with such high-tech equipment, so she naturally couldn't figure out how to unlock them.
 

 
Just as she frowned in confusion, she found a manual at the bottom of the box. After reading the brief introduction, her expression immediately fell.
 

 
[Facepalm.jpg]
 

 
[Sister Zhao might be ungrateful, but the production team is really the worst.]
 

 
[Why would firearms have instruction manuals?]
 

 
A line of special effects text quickly addressed the audience's confusion:
 

 
《Since we're pursuing the unethical, we must follow through completely!》
 

 
《That's right, that instruction manual was hastily compiled by our modeling team in a burst of speed and placed inside!》
 

 
The audience was delighted.
 

 
It was evident that, in addition to the two opposing factions, this survival variety show also featured an invisible conflict—Tong Zhao versus the relentless production team. Such a confrontation was rare in the world; typically, it was the director who maintained tight control over the guests. No one expected Sister Zhao to turn the tables and repeatedly surprise the audience.
 

 
Viewers had grown a bit weary of traditional variety shows.
 

 
They would wonder which parts were meticulously arranged by the production team, and what meaning there was in their emotional ups and downs. The conflicts that occurred in variety shows were all scripted by the director, differing only slightly from movies in terms of portraying real human emotions.
 

 
Unlike movies, variety show fans looked forward to the unexpected.
 

 
When they saw the production team flustered by the endless surprises from the special guests, that anticipation was fully met.
 

 
Some viewers watch reality shows hoping to see celebrities fail.
 

 
If the celebrities don’t fail, then fine, let the famous production team take the fall instead!
 

 
Past guests who have appeared on "One Life Survivor" continue to follow this show, frequently venting their frustrations on Weibo. Most of them are unknowns or ordinary people, so initially, no one paid them any attention. Until one former contestant who made a name for themselves on the show posted:
 

 
@Long Jue v:
 

 
“If I have such opponents, I probably won’t win the prize.”
 

 
Although they didn't name names, those in the know immediately understood who they were talking about.
 

 
Fans quickly replied, insisting, “How could that be? Brother is the best!”
 

 
As for the retweets from bystanders and marketing accounts, most were looking forward to a clash between the two.
 

 
A few insightful individuals commented: “They’re a legitimate movie star who just finished shooting a wildly successful blockbuster, and they’re booked solid with offers… Variety shows are just for fun; what’s with all the hype about a showdown like Tyson vs. Ali?”
 

 
Thinking about it carefully, that was indeed the case.
 

 
[Ah, but this is still really fun! Just thinking about it is amusing!]
 

 
Fun and interesting.
 

 
This is truly the ultimate answer in this era of entertainment, the only currency more effective than beauty.
 

 
Long Jue's Weibo post created quite a buzz, coinciding with a day that lacked major entertainment news. Netizens, bored and scrolling through a dull homepage, found a marketing account that had dug up previous guest comments from "One Life Survivor" about this episode. They compiled a collection of the guests reveling in the production team’s misfortune, which naturally led to a wave of shares and laughter.
 

 
More curious onlookers, eager to see how Tong Zhao could turn a deadlock into something spectacular, flooded into the live stream. When it came time to choose a contestant they were interested in, they unhesitatingly picked Tong Zhao, proudly displaying their "freebie" fan badge...
 

 
Backstage, a tally was taken...
 

 
Sure enough, Tong Zhao’s votes completely overwhelmed the competition.
 

 
The focus was gradually drifting away from the planned direction of the variety show.
 

 
While the production team could control the resources Tong Zhao received, the audience's expectations were beyond their control.
 

 
Strictly speaking, having Tong Zhao on "One Life Survivor" was an invisible confrontation between the second dimension and the third dimension, a challenge from humanity to God!
 

 
…
 

 
Viewers were enjoying the show to the point of exasperation and found Tong Zhao extremely entertaining.
 

 
This woman was like an endless book, full of inexhaustible talents and never-ending bravado.
 

 
The production team thought Tong Zhao was out of options.
 

 
Meanwhile, the audience was enthusiastic about offering her strategies, as if she could actually hear them—
 

 
[Why not just cut off the thumb from the previous corpse?]
 

 
[You must not have seen many dramas; fingerprint unlocking technology relies not only on having a hand but also on body temperature and pressure sensitivity… A person’s body temperature drops quickly after death, so even if you had the finger of a deceased fugitive, the usable period would only be three hours; after that, it would start to stiffen and be ineffective.]
 

 
[As long as you have a hand, it's fine, hahaha. That’s a weird sense of humor that really hit the mark.]
 

 
Duan Ge tentatively reported this issue to her superior.
 

 
“I’ve captured a batch of weapons supply from the survivors, but I can’t use them because of the fingerprint authentication lock. Is there a solution?”
 

 
In Duan Ge’s understanding, her superiors were quite capable.
 

 
It was just that most of the time, they didn’t help her.
 

 
This was also convenient for the production team to give orders that would be accepted.
 

 
Her dog-like superior (the director) replied bluntly: [You are already a mature imperial assassin; you need to learn to unlock it yourself.]
 

 
Duan Ge tightened her grip on the gun handle expressionlessly.
 

 
There was a groove on the gun where one finger could be pressed down, but when she placed her finger there, it didn’t respond. Since this was support from that group, it would most likely require their fingerprints.
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [Why?]
 

 
The inner voice in her mind shifted from bland to suppressed, interrupting the rhythm of the audience's laughter.
 

 
Is the rabbit feeling wronged?
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [Why is it that their superiors even considered this? A bunch of useless people I wiped out are getting such good treatment?]
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [They all deserve to die!]
 

 
The rabbit was not wronged; the rabbit was furious.
 

 
The gun handle creaked under her grip, making a sound that was unsettling to hear.
 

 
Duan Ge suddenly stood up, deciding not to wait any longer. She wanted to quickly eliminate these pampered little useless individuals favored by a good leader, complete the mission, and get a pass from her superior to leave the city. Once she left Canaan City, she would figure out a way to get rid of her dog-like superior who was connected to her, and from then on, she would be free as a rabbit in the open sky.
 

 
...
 

 
In the filming backstage.
 

 
Director Chen pondered, "Is the dog-like superior she wants to eliminate talking about us?"
 

 
The deputy director replied, "It's just a dog-like superior; it should be you, Director."
 

 
Director Chen said, "I'll smoke a cigarette to calm my nerves."
 

 
Director Chen continued, "I'm not scared, really not scared. Just think about how great this program is for the effects! Tong Zhao's Weibo is also gaining followers; it's a good thing! At worst... at worst, we can wait for her to wake up and treat her to a nice meal!"
 

 
...
 

 
Led by Kong Yeming, the survivors moved away from the gas area and settled on the second floor of a residential building.
 

 
Since the four-person team was easily wiped out and only one of the eight was killed, Kong Yeming ultimately decided that five people would share one room, sleeping in the living room, while two single rooms would be occupied by the remaining three who would guard the hallway.
 

 
They would try to act collectively as much as possible.
 

 
Kong Yeming sternly emphasized, "Remember, if anything happens, wake up the others. We need to respond immediately as a group. From what happened before at school... at least he still fears large numbers.”
 

 
They were not standing there waiting to be slaughtered; they had a strong desire to survive.
 

 
Seeing such careful consideration, the audience couldn’t help but worry about Tong Zhao.
 

 
[If only there were guns.]
 

 
Although there were no guns, Duan Ge had obtained a batch of cold weapons, which was a significant upgrade from just carrying a dagger.
 

 
Now she had a telescope!
 

 
Searching for living people in a dead city was like everyone looking for grains of sand, searching for those moving points of life.
 

 
Kong Yeming was very cautious and did not venture out for the first two days, staying on the second floor and sharing the limited food with everyone. Even though they tried to ration their food, feeding fifteen mouths consumed a lot. After two days of stable living, they finally began organizing small teams to go out and search for resources on the third day.
 

 
Five people per team, divided into three teams for action.
 

 
They searched through one street after another, ensuring that if one team called for help, the other teams would be within earshot and could immediately provide support.
 

 
It was very well thought out.
 

 
While they huddled tightly at their base, Duan Ge still roamed the streets and alleys of The City every day, never feeling bored. The audience also preferred not to watch these people cowering in fear; it was too dull—much better to watch Tong Zhao!
 

 
It had to be said that Tong Zhao truly knew how to create engaging moments.
 

 
Duan Ge, who never took the conventional route, seemed to have endless energy as she leaped across rooftops and residential buildings. She even climbed the walls of tall structures, a faint smile gracing her lips, indicating that she was thoroughly enjoying herself. The wind blew her short hair, making her appear even more light and agile.
 

 
Fans simply couldn’t get enough.
 

 
With lively and cute children's music playing in the background, it was like watching a happy little bunny frolicking through a concrete forest.
 

 
Today, the bunny was also guarding the peace of The City!
 

 
Two days of silence couldn't wear down the patience of a professional assassin. When Kong Yeming and his group appeared within Duan Ge’s line of sight, the previously dull live stream instantly erupted with excitement—
 

 
[Bunny is charging for Mama!]
 

 
[I’ve been keeping the livestream open for the past two days; it feels like I’ve raised a desktop pet that can run and jump.]
 

 
[They’re all moving together. Does Bunny have any chance?]
 

 
……
 

 
Just when the mom fans were worried, Duan Ge, spotting the survivors on screen, broke into a smile.
 

 
In this variety show, she didn’t smile much.
 

 
Apart from the rare times when she enjoyed a hearty meal and her eyes crinkled with satisfaction, she mostly had a slight smile while parkouring alone, but it was very faint and not obvious. It merely allowed the audience to sense her relaxed demeanor, but it couldn’t be said that she was genuinely happy.
 

 
[The girl looks so cute when she smiles QAQ]
 

 
[I want to protect Bunny’s smile!]
 

 
Pampered by the mom fans, Duan Ge let out a light, low laugh filled with a hint of dark intensity: [I’m going to kill them all today!]
 

 
[……]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
What should we do if the little one is about to go on a killing spree? Waiting online, getting anxious.
 

 
Duan Ge selected a submachine gun, a handgun, and a rifle from the box to take with her, leaving the sniper rifle behind since she wouldn’t be able to use it for long-range since she couldn’t unlock it. She stuffed one gun into her backpack, filling it with as many magazines as she could carry; it felt heavy and satisfying.
 

 
The survivors were searching through a shopping mall.
 

 
Most of the store windows had been shattered, and there were no edible supplies left inside. However, items like jewelry and watches remained intact, though without specialized lighting, even expensive luxury goods lost their luster.
 

 
Seeing where they were searching improved Duan Ge’s mood even more.
 

 
The mall's complex layout was more suitable for her to showcase her skills.
 

 
Duan Ge thought: [So which of these three teams should I target?]
 

 
The mall had a large glass ceiling, providing excellent lighting during the day. If the midday sun was too harsh, the security would press a button backstage, causing a mechanism on the roof to pull up a layer of gauze to help diffuse the light.
 


In ordinary survival variety shows, it was a popular segment for contestants to “scavenge” in supermarkets and malls.
 

 
But the audience clearly preferred to watch from Tong Zhao's perspective.
 

 
They wanted to see how she would infiltrate the mall, outnumbered!
 

 
Duan Ge first went to the already deserted security room, where she found the mall’s floor plan. Searching through the security room often yielded useful information; most of the guards who were just getting paid wouldn’t pay attention to it and didn’t need to.
 

 
The entire city was without electricity, and the surveillance cameras were all in darkness.
 

 
Duan Ge studied for a while, first turning off all the lights in the mall, and then she found the switch for the mall's backup power supply—
 

 
[Can this even be done?]
 

 
[The little one is really capable!]
 

 
[No, this is beyond just being capable... How are you so familiar with this?]
 

 
Tong Zhao had become a mature assassin, learning how to infiltrate the mall on her own.
 

 
After a while, the ten or so surveillance screens surrounding Duan Ge lit up, clearly capturing the movements of all the survivors.
 

 
After all, it was backup power mainly used to supply emergency lighting and network access in the hallways, so it couldn't be used for long. Duan Ge calculated that it could only support an hour...
 

 
Duan Ge: [That’s enough.]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I just need to see where they are.]
 

 
The survivors still didn't know they had not only been discovered but that every one of their movements was under the hunter's surveillance. She focused on one man and one woman from Team Sun; their shorter stature made them easier to control. It would be best to catch them both.
 

 
They moved systematically through the shops, skipping over stores that clearly had no use—such as clothing and bag shops—while targeting stores like Watsons for thorough searches.
 

 
The survivors hadn’t come away empty-handed that morning.
 

 
They had found a wrench in a hardware store and equipped each person with a kitchen knife from a market; at least they could pretend to be tough guys in Causeway Bay without any issues.
 

 
After observing the surveillance footage in the security room for a while, Duan Ge hid in a Watsons store.
 

 
[The little bunny is lurking!]
 

 
[Waiting for a bunny ambush.]
 

 
Once the perspective shifted to that of the hunter, the survival show suddenly felt much lighter.
 

 
For the group of survivors, however, this was undoubtedly a horror film.
 

 
Having searched in the mall for quite some time, the group gradually lowered their guard. He Su was the first to walk into the store: “We haven’t found anything; these people cleaned out the place before they fled.”
 

 
The snack area was completely empty.
 

 
As far as the eye could see, there were still unnecessary supplies like foundation and lipstick on the shelves.
 

 
The five of them didn’t give up, spreading out to search in the spacious store.
 

 
The female doctor spotted a large roll of toilet paper in the corner.
 

 
Duan Ge patiently waited in the staff room.
 

 
Someone would definitely come in looking for something, but the door was narrow, only allowing one person to pass at a time, maybe two at most if they squeezed close together.
 

 
She didn’t need to peek out to see; just from the sound of footsteps, she could tell how far away the person was. She needed to take control of this unlucky soul coming toward her in two seconds.
 

 
The footsteps grew closer.
 

 
He Su wanted to see if any supplies had been overlooked in the staff lounge.
 

 
As he opened the door, the audience’s hearts rose, their heartbeats quickening.
 

 
As He Su grasped the doorknob, he thought: “Could there be enemy troops inside?”
 

 
This sudden thought heightened his alertness as he prepared to quickly back out and shout for help if anything seemed off.
 

 
He pushed the door open forcefully.
 

 
However, the space behind the door was empty, unlike the scene he had imagined.
 

 
Only the audience watching the livestream knew that the slender Duan Ge was hiding behind the door, right in his blind spot.
 

 
He let out a sigh of relief.
 

 
He Su: "Ugh, I'm really such a coward."
 

 
With that thought, he took three steps inside.
 

 
At that moment, Duan Ge was already behind him.
 

 
Before He Su could sense anything, Duan Ge reached out and locked her arm around his neck while roughly slapping a piece of packing tape over his mouth, sticking it to his nose as well. This left him only able to make muffled sounds of "Mmm mmm mmm mmm!" — quieter than if she had just covered his mouth.
 

 
Uncertain about how long the unlocking would last, Duan Ge had no intention of suffocating him, fearing that if he died, his fingerprints would be useless.
 

 
She quickly tied He Su's hands behind his back with some rope and used his thumb to unlock all three guns. After unlocking, the pixel display above the small groove lit up, counting down... 1800, 1799, 1798...
 

 
Duan Ge: "Is this in seconds?"
 

 
She quickly calculated in her mind: it was half an hour, hovering on the ambiguous edge of being enough and not enough.
 

 
Duan Ge gently peeled back a corner of the tape to allow He Su to breathe, albeit barely.
 

 
As soon as he made contact with the air, he immediately began to gasp for breath, panicking to the point of forgetting to make a loud noise to call for help.
 

 
Duan Ge lowered her head and smiled. "Be good, and I’ll let you live for another half an hour."
 

 
He Su couldn’t understand her words and grew even more frightened.
 

 
The audience understood.
 

 
The content of the show had been so lighthearted over the past two days that they had almost forgotten what kind of killing machine she really was. They genuinely thought of her as a carefree, struggling little rabbit, parkouring around The City every day...
 

 
[Ugh, I've been A'd!]
 

 
[Cubs are so ruthless, mommy likes it, woo woo woo!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, kill me!]
 

 
Without showing a hint of her sharp teeth and claws, she had truly made the cheetah look like a rabbit.
 

 
Once he calmed his breathing, He Su was able to make out the appearance of the person in front of him in the dim light—
 

 
It was an exceptionally beautiful face.
 

 
Even when viewed from below at this deadly angle, it was still undeniably stunning.
 

 
Although it was highly inappropriate, He Su couldn't help but think: “So there are such beautiful girls among the enemy's lackeys?”
 

 
[Well, there goes my chance with a pretty girl.]
 

 
[But if you had a choice, would you rather be killed by a greasy middle-aged man or have your throat slit by a gorgeous and sexy lady?]
 

 
[...Such a persuasive argument!]
 

 
"He Su?"
 

 
Although the struggle between the two ended quickly, with Duan Ge successfully executing a unilateral ambush, some sounds inevitably emerged from the staff room. Her teammates called out loudly, as this guy was quite talkative, and just a single response would put them at ease.
 

 
From the depths of the room, a voice could be heard, but it was an unintelligible female voice.
 

 
The remaining four momentarily failed to react—
 

 
Then, a gunshot rang out, echoing throughout the entire store!
# Chapter74
What happened?
 

 
Lying on the ground with his hands tightly bound by a belt, He Su couldn't understand the situation outside. When he heard his companions' terrified screams, he crazily arched his body on the floor and kicked his legs wildly, trying to stop the crazy woman from her violent actions.
 

 
Just as he was about to kick Duan Ge, she effortlessly lifted her leg to evade the attack and then stomped down hard on his ankle. He had no idea where she was stepping, but she managed to immobilize his legs, her military boots mercilessly grinding against him.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Be quiet."
 

 
He Su didn't know what she was saying.
 

 
However, the violent glare she shot at him made him instinctively close his mouth tightly.
 

 
How terrifying...
 

 
He Su shivered.
 

 
Duan Ge's shooting was precise; in the blink of an eye, the number of survivors in the top right corner dropped from 15/20 to 11/20. The three people in the filming room awoke to see the equally astonished expressions of the staff...
 

 
Actually, people had rushed over upon hearing the commotion.
 

 
Duan Ge initially wanted to wait with her gun for a few of the less intelligent ones to walk into her line of fire. However, after being angrily reminded by Kong Yeming, no one dared to make a reckless move.
 

 
"Fine then…”
 

 
She softly muttered as she used strong packing tape to attach the machine gun's grip to a cardboard box, placing it under the cashier counter and slightly pushing it out. Anyone glancing in from outside the store would see the exposed gun muzzle.
 

 
“Sure enough, ambushes suit my style better, right?”
 

 
“And I’ve really wanted to try this trick…”
 

 
After taking down three enemies who had much better treatment than her, Duan Ge's mood improved. She smiled joyfully and chatted with the foreign survivor in a language he couldn't understand—he didn't understand, but he could see what this woman was planning.
 

 
Duan Ge picked up another gun and took a breathable, dust-proof black mask from her waist bag, putting it on and revealing only her cold, sharp eyes.
 

 
This wasn't to conceal her identity or to look cool.
 

 
It was just that there was quite a bit of dust in the ventilation ducts.
 

 
Duan Ge crawled from the ventilation duct to the women’s restroom on the same floor— a short distance, just adjacent. If it were any farther, she wouldn’t bother crawling. Not only would it be strenuous, but she would also likely end up in strange places, which weren't suitable for moving around.
 

 
……
 

 
Kong Yeming was very cautious. After hearing the gunfire, he stopped his companions from rushing in impulsively.
 

 
He suspected that his teammates were likely in grave danger. They couldn't fall into the enemy's trap and let the sacrifices increase: “Since they have firearms but haven't directly killed us, they probably aren’t as numerous as I imagined. If we all rush in together to attack, maybe some will get injured, but the chances of survival will be higher.”
 

 
“Rush in?” someone questioned.
 

 
“I’ll be the first to charge in,” Kong Yeming replied calmly. “We could also exit now and escape the mall, but I don’t think we’d get far. What do you all think?”
 

 
The group fell silent.
 

 
Someone quickly poked their head out to glance through the glass window and immediately spotted the dark muzzle of the machine gun, their heart tightening as they pulled their head back. “He’s still waiting for us! Shouldn’t we just run?”
 

 
Run?
 

 
The group exchanged glances, and no one dared to make a decision. They all turned to look at Kong Yeming in unison.
 

 
Kong Yeming sighed inwardly, realizing that his strategy of overwhelming numbers was no longer feasible—[These people are too likely to betray their teammates,] he thought.
 

 
[Kong Ge (brother ) is right.]
 

 
[Kong Ge understands people; I'm starting to like him. He performed the best in this show besides Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Why not just run away directly?]
 

 
The next moment, Kong Yeming’s inner voice answered the audience’s doubts: [The enemy’s goal is to wipe us out. We have a relationship of life and death. Previously, the enemy was hidden while we were in the open, but now that we finally know he’s in the Watsons store, we can’t miss this opportunity to take him out…]
 

 
Kong Yeming helplessly sighed, “Since you all want to run, then let’s run.”
 

 
One more day of life is better than none.
 

 
This answer obviously aligned more with the group’s expectations; after all, turning and fleeing didn’t require much courage.
 

 
However, just as they turned around, gunfire erupted—
 

 
Specifically coming out from the ventilation duct, Duan Ge had two reasons: one, she had a sudden impulse to make her entrance in the classic assassin style, and two, she was also on guard against what Kong Yeming had said about a group of eleven charging in at the same time.
 

 
To minimize risk, she had to catch them off guard.
 

 
Before everyone could react, she planned to take them all out!
 

 
All the escapees were focused on the muzzle of the gun in the Watsons store ahead, and they all felt a sense of retreat, thinking about how to avoid the enemy and that if they could escape, they should.
 

 
With this mindset, how could they possibly stand against Duan Ge?
 

 
“How did she appear behind us!?”
 

 
“Run!”
 

 
As gunfire rang out, some fled without a word, some reminded their “teammates,” and others pulled their teammates to use as shields against the bullets. Kong Yeming was hoarse, desperately trying to reorganize them, only to find it was futile.
 

 
The pressure Duan Ge exerted made them lose their courage to resist.
 

 
Except for Kong Yeming, whose fighting spirit was at 50, everyone else was below 20—while they weren’t scared to the point of begging for mercy and waiting to die on the spot, they also lacked the courage to fight her to the death. With every gunshot, someone in the filming chamber awakened in shock.
 

 
Not only were they unprepared, but the production team was also stunned.
 

 
The entire staff backstage fell into silence.
 

 
No one had anticipated this kind of situation.
 

 
Yes, Tong Zhao had previously performed excellently, her handgun skills were precise, but what was happening in this mall was on a completely different level. Who would have thought that she could kill everyone as if she were in a god mode! You could say she was like a berserker; she was seriously crawling through the ventilation ducts for infiltration. You could call her an assassin, but she was at most relying on surprise attacks, killing them all right in front of them.
 

 
After a brief moment of silence, the backstage erupted into a flurry of discussions—
 

 
“Damn, what’s going on? She’s taking them out one by one!”
 

 
“Quick, modify the data! Don’t let her finish them all!”
 

 
The data technician was nearly in tears: “What can I change to stop her? Besides, I think what I change isn’t as fast as her kills…”
 

 
All the staff turned to look at Director Chen, waiting for him to make a decision.
 

 
A cigarette slipped from Director Chen’s fingers and fell to the ground.
 

 
“Don’t worry about it,” he said.
 

 
“Don’t worry? Are you serious? But this is a huge mess!”
 

 
…
 

 
Director Chen raised his hand and pressed his forehead: “Because there’s only one survivor left alive, and everyone else has awakened.”
 

 
Ah, I see.
 

 
The filming backstage fell into another long silence, with only the voices of questions rising and falling in the filming chamber—seeing that almost everyone had awakened, the contestants thought it was a normal filming wrap-up, still puzzled that they didn’t feel the usual headache from the common instinctive reaction after long-duration variety shows.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao and He Su remained asleep in the cabin.
 

 
…
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t listen to stories and left no survivors.
 

 
After clearing the scene, she counted the number of bodies present, confirming that she had captured them all. She then diligently began to take off their watches: "I want to see what I can draw from this."
 

 
After removing the watches, Duan Ge remembered that she had left someone in the store.
 

 
He Su heard the outside noise transition from chaotic sounds to angry shouts, then to screams, and finally to silence…
 

 
He began to wish he was the one getting shot.
 

 
Not out of self-sacrifice, but because waiting for the big bad to return here was truly more torturous than death.
 

 
He Su felt his heart racing, almost ready to burst out of his chest.
 

 
[No sound? Could it be that they all got killed? How did she do it? Is she crazy? Help, I really hope she forgets about me and doesn’t come back to finish me off. But if she leaves me here, I won’t survive either…]
 

 
In his fear, all kinds of chaotic thoughts flooded his mind.
 

 
Then, he heard footsteps gradually approaching.
 

 
[He Su’s perspective really gives off a horror movie vibe.]
 

 
[Just a passerby, watching a survival variety show for the first time, how does one survive this?]
 

 
[Look at the title, “One Life Survivor,” that’s about Tong Zhao. Don’t you get it yet?]
 

 
[Wow, that’s a perfect essay right to the point.]
 

 
With tears in his eyes, He Su saw that slender figure.
 

 
She was splattered with blood, coming from a respectable opponent— the only one who dared to rush in and try to dodge her shots with agile movements, closing the distance to subdue her, Kong Yeming. This bloodied appearance made her seem even colder and more sinister, almost inhuman.
 

 
Like the Grim Reaper?
 

 
That description seemed too literary.
 

 
In any case, when He Su saw her, he couldn't help but think: "My dog at home looks like this when it sees the butcher."
 

 
All the audience focused on how Duan Ge would handle He Su.
 

 
He Su was still wondering: "Am I going to face the top ten tortures of the Qing Dynasty? No, please! Just give me a quick end!"
 

 
"You really didn’t need to be kept alive,"
 

 
Duan Ge scoffed with a tone of indignation, "Seems like all that good food didn’t improve you much."
 

 
The rabbit was not only brutal but also held a grudge.
 

 
He Su, considered somewhat handsome among the contestants and having survived to the end, made the audience draw comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, Duan Ge didn’t give them a chance to ship a new couple; she simply ended it all with a shot, took off his last watch, and hummed a little tune as she returned to the base.
 

 
A true total annihilation.
 

 
Like something out of a dream...
 

 
In traditional variety shows, guests often tone down their performance to continue filming, even if they are extremely talented, or they may build up their act gradually. But in survival variety shows, for Duan Ge, this was her real life—who would consider the show’s effect in a fight for survival? If you’re going to kill, do it quickly; anything that can be resolved in one day should never be dragged into the next!
 

 
How could they continue filming like this?
 

 
The staff exchanged glances, and half of them went to explain the situation to the awakened guests.
 

 
In order to stretch the episode’s runtime and because they had previously promised Tong Zhao's fans that the top ten on the fan leaderboard would have the chance to participate in a lottery for her, the show was not over yet; it had just turned into a "one-person variety show." In the real "One Life Survivor," after returning to the base, she redeemed a total of nineteen watches at once!
 

 
The results of the ten lottery draws were determined by the top ten wealthy fans on the leaderboard:
 

 
1. Unified Old Vinegar Pickled Beef Noodles
 
2. Hema Fresh Instant Food
 
3. Soup Master
 
4. Mediterranean Chicken Skewers (a box of 7 skewers)
 
5. A pack of marinated salmon
 
6. Lazy Instant Handcrafted Mini Lobsters
 
7. A shampoo and body wash set from a certain sponsor brand
 
8. A snack gift pack
 
9. Self-heating mini hot pot
 
10. Strawberry Milk-flavored Popsicle
 

 
...
 

 
After exchanging for a pile of miscellaneous items, Duan Ge sat cross-legged in front of a mountain of supplies, no longer as excited and anxious as she had been when she saw the cooked food before. She leisurely picked through the items, glancing at this one for a moment and touching that one, exuding the happiness of a hamster surrounded by a room full of sunflower seeds.
 

 
After all, having experienced the resource shortages of a post-apocalyptic world, Duan Ge had a deep obsession with food.
 

 
Even a bland and tasteless instant noodle cake would be thoroughly enjoyed by her.
 

 
In the end, Duan Ge chose a pack of marinated salmon, Mediterranean-style chicken skewers, and a self-heating hot pot. Once the mini hot pot was heated up, she tossed in the chicken balls, letting them roll around in the boiling, spicy red oil broth, which soon glistened with a layer of oil.
 

 
After eating and drinking her fill, she treated herself to a strawberry milk-flavored popsicle...
 

 
What a divine life this was!
 

 
Duan Ge: [Does this mean the dog boss is finally acting like a human?]
 

 
Hearing the little one’s confused thoughts, the fans were eager to jump up: [Absolutely not, it’s all about mom’s love!]
 

 
[The dog production team wouldn’t treat her like a person; only we are the solid support behind our little one.]
 

 
[I want to see Tong Zhao on a food variety show; she looks so cute when she eats seriously!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Never mind, none of these seem like normal supplies anyway...]
 

 
After finishing her meal, Duan Ge carefully packed up the remaining supplies and slung the ridiculously heavy backpack onto her back, heading toward the quarantine line outside of The City. She had completed her mission, her hands stained with blood, and the smell of gunpowder lingering on her palms.
 

 
As the sun set, it gradually draped the entire City in a layer of golden clouds.
 

 
Duan Ge walked down the deserted street, the setting sun casting a long, elongated shadow behind her, her slender figure contrasting amusingly with the heavy, oversized backpack.
 

 
The background music was Delara's "We Don't Run From Anyone."
 

 
Assassins fear nothing.
 

 
No matter who it is or how many people there are, Duan Ge will not shy away.
 

 
As her figure grew smaller in the distance, the scene gradually blurred, and the only clear words that remained were...
 

 
"One Life Survivor."
 

 
This time, the survivor is: Tong Zhao.
 

 
This time, the production team had no time to modify the data.
 

 
The wall Tong Zhao stood behind was so high that even a desperate dog couldn’t jump over it.
 

 
As the list of behind-the-scenes staff appeared, the audience finally realized... it was really over! Those who had come to enjoy the show left five-star reviews in the live stream, while seasoned variety show fans quickly noticed that this was clearly at least half shorter than the expected season duration. Ending it like this was likely a last resort...
 

 
What else could they film?
 

 
Would they just let Tong Zhao do an eating broadcast, filling the remaining half of the duration with that?
 

 
Throw the "dead" guests back in for a sequel titled "One Life Survivor: Twenty People Return from the Dead"? Please, that would be utterly humiliating; the audience would be furious, and no one would tolerate such nonsense. After weighing the pros and cons, Director Chen chose the path with the least loss, leaving this episode with a dignified conclusion and hoping for high quality—
 

 
As long as enough people watched, they could still break even.
 

 
Once they realized it was finished, some reluctant variety show fans and supporters didn’t exit; instead, they began chatting in the comments section, filling the screen with applause emojis for a while.
 

 
[It wasn't enough to watch; I want to see Tong Zhao continue filming!]
 

 
[Will Tong Zhao still participate in variety shows in the future?]
 

 
[What variety show would still dare to invite her? She would just take everyone out!/Dog head]
 

 
[Don’t be so petty; this is the production team underestimating her abilities. If it were a survival show on a deserted island, it might be much more interesting.]
 

 
[I’ve said it before: waiting for Sister Zhao to battle a T-Rex!]
 

 
The comments were so lively that even after the live broadcast of "One Life Survivor" ended, the discussion continued for a full two hours, overshadowing other serious 24-hour variety shows that were airing at the same time, leaving them frustrated and speechless.
 

 
So annoying.
 

 
……
 

 
When Duan Ge woke up in the holographic filming pod, she immediately relinquished her position to her primary persona.
 

 
The long-sleeping Tong Zhao opened her eyes, looking dazed, as if her soul had been scattered.
 

 
When she finally opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the chandelier on the ceiling and a circle of staff and fellow guests surrounding the pod.
 

 
It was like a combination of Tang Seng, Sha Seng, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie, all with the same "You’re awake!" expression.
 

 
Director Chen was delighted: “You’re awake!”
 

 
It was pure and perfectly aligned with reality.
 

 
Tong Zhao was even more confused.
 

 
Propping herself up with one hand on the bottom of the pod, she asked after her assistant sister helped remove the data cables connecting her forehead and temples, “What is everyone doing? Is this a collective viewing of my remains? I’m not dead, am I?”
 

 
“Puh! Don’t say such ominous things.”
 

 
The assistant used to be her fan.
 

 
After several episodes of "Cloud Raising the Rabbit," the fan's admiration had transformed into maternal love. Hearing Tong Zhao curse herself like that, she couldn’t help but disapprove and correct her. Tong Zhao was more accepting of the care that girls might overstep boundaries, so she obediently nodded and said, “Okay.”
 

 
Director Chen wore a sympathetic expression: "Let’s put it this way—she can’t possibly die even if everyone else does."
 

 
The other staff immediately showed expressions of discomfort, clearly feeling called out.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who hadn’t yet regained her memories, looked over: "Director, do you really want me to die?"
 

 
"No, no!"
 

 
Under her intense gaze, Director Chen quickly shook his head like a mouse that had its tail stepped on. "I wouldn’t dare! Um, actually, this is everyone waiting for you to join us for a celebration feast."
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled: "Even though I don’t have a headache, don’t you all need to rest this time?"
 

 
In the past, whenever filming a long-term survival variety show, they would always arrange a full day of rest after each awakening.
 

 
At this point, Director Chen sighed again: "No need to rest."
 

 
After all, it won’t take long.
 

 
The others died much earlier than her, and after a shower, they all said they were well-rested.
 

 
It didn’t matter that the others weren’t coming; this meal was mainly because he didn’t want to offend Tong Zhao and wanted to make a good impression before she regained her memories.
 

 
So Director Chen clearly explained to the others before arranging the celebration feast that those who didn’t want to come didn’t have to.
 

 
But how could the guests pass up the chance to get close to a variety show director?
 

 
Knowing that the celebration feast would be filmed in full for behind-the-scenes editing later, everyone became even more enthusiastic.
 

 
Even the amateur guests who weren’t pursuing fame but came to have fun immediately decided to attend the dinner when they learned they would have a chance to eat with Tong Zhao, even if they had to endure a headache.
 

 
With twenty guests and the staff behind the scenes, there had to be at least four large tables of food.
 

 
The production team was considerate in this regard. Noticing the weather forecast predicted no rain that evening, they set up the banquet by the lakeside, allowing everyone to enjoy the beautiful scenery while indulging in delicious food. After returning to her room to freshen up, Tong Zhao changed into casual attire for the event. Her table was filled with the main crew members, including the director, assistant director, and variety show screenwriters.
 

 
As soon as Tong Zhao appeared, there was a wave of cheers by the lakeside—
 

 
“The super assassin has arrived!”
 

 
“Super assassin? Isn’t it an empire?”
 

 
“Because she has killed more than eight people without dying even once, she’s a super assassin now.”
 

 
“Wow, that’s impressive!”
 

 
The crew of ‘One Life Survivor’ was relatively young, and they spoke so casually that it felt like a barrage of comments.
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t regained her memories from the variety show yet, but seeing this scene, she smiled slightly with a calm demeanor, as if everything was under her control. Her gaze fell on Director Chen, who immediately understood and stood up to pull out the chair next to him: “Come on, Sister Zhao, sit here.”
 

 
It felt a bit strange for her to be called "Sister Zhao" since she was younger, and it carried a hint of flattery.
 

 
"Sister Zhao" was a compromise between the two.
 

 
Before filming the variety show, the others looked at her with suspicion or disdain.
 

 
But after filming…
 

 
She silently observed the looks the others gave her and found only admiration.
 

 
A small number of the guests who had fallen early still looked at Tong Zhao with awe.
 

 
As Tong Zhao sat down, she asked the voice of Duan Ge in her mind: "What did you do to win these people over as your fans?"
 

 
Duan Ge replied, "I haven't remembered yet."
 

 
Concubine Chen was quite pleased that no one dared to look at her with lustful eyes anymore: "Isn't this only natural? Little Ge is just that outstanding."
 

 
Duan Ge smiled slightly: "You’re right."
 

 
By the lakeside, there was a long truck with a screen hanging from the cargo area.
 

 
The assistant director beside Tong Zhao explained that this was going to be used for projecting exciting clips from ‘One Life Survivor’ during the meal.
 

 
The variety show screenwriter looked a bit constipated: "Actually, it's just your solo performance, Sister Zhao."
 

 
"Really?" Tong Zhao asked, a bit curious.
 

 
”You'll know when you see it later."
 

 
The waitstaff quickly began serving the four large tables.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced over; the other tables were filled with beautifully presented home-cooked dishes.
 

 
But in front of her…
 

 
There were abalone, sea cucumbers, shark fins, and fish maw—nothing less than the most luxurious, with even more extravagance!
 

 
"Miss Tong, please move aside," a server said softly. Tong Zhao instinctively shifted to the side, and the plate in front of her was taken away, replaced by a large bowl of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall!
 

 
How big is it?
 

 
To be specific, after this bowl of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was placed down, she could no longer see the faces of the people sitting across from her.
 

 
It was uniquely set in front of her, and no one else had one.
 

 
The others looked completely normal, seemingly unaware that there was any problem at all.
# Chapter75
The waiter opened the lid and explained:
 

 
“Our Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is made using a more traditional method, going through thirty processes, twelve cooking techniques, and incorporating thirteen types of meat and seafood, bringing out its aroma and freshness with sea salt.”
 

 
As the lid was opened, a fragrant aroma filled the air.
 

 
Tong Zhao had no doubt that it truly involved thirty processes.
 

 
After all, sitting atop was half a large abalone soaking in golden broth. Since the ingredients were this lavish, the kitchen naturally would be willing to invest more effort to avoid wasting such expensive ingredients.
 

 
“Why not try it while it's hot?”
 

 
Director Chen kindly poured her a drink: “This wine is also quite good; it’s locally brewed fruit wine. You can have a taste, and if you don’t like it, just let them switch to juice or water.” He spoke in detail, as if afraid Tong Zhao might misunderstand and think he was forcing alcohol on her.
 

 
“Okay, thank you.”
 

 
The drinking glasses were small, and with the director being so courteous, Tong Zhao also gave him face and downed the drink.
 

 
Director Chen visibly relaxed.
 

 
The other staff members also looked at the director with approving eyes.
 

 
What can I say about this atmosphere?
 

 
It was like when a certain gang leader in "Young and Dangerous" poured tea and offered apologies to characters like Chen Haonan or Liang Kun; if he didn’t accept it, it would imply that someone might end up dead.
 

 
Tong Zhao considered herself a law-abiding good citizen with a fairly good temper,
 

 
But this is too much!
 

 
Abnormal behavior is suspicious. Could it be that they want something from her and are trying to butter her up first?
 

 
She quietly asked, “Is this Buddha Jumps Over the Wall only for me? Isn’t that inappropriate?”
 

 
“There’s nothing inappropriate about it; after all, you’re the winner,”
 

 
Director Chen smiled slightly and raised his voice to ask everyone, “Do you have any objections?”
 

 
The whole table shook their heads in unison, looking completely convinced.
 

 
“You see,”
 

 
Director Chen continued, “If you don’t believe me, I can ask the other tables…”
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped his puzzling behavior, wanting to say to eat quietly and not cause a scene, but then she noticed that everyone was sitting quietly without touching their chopsticks, all looking like they were waiting for her to start eating first.
 

 
[...Duan Ge, how many people have you gotten into trouble with this!]
 

 
Duan Ge had an innocent expression: [They used to wait for me to eat first in the camp; I got used to it.]
 

 
The “camp” here referred to the survival camp she had led in the apocalyptic realm, where everything revolved around her. Even couples who fought would hesitate to act without consulting her first. Later, when conditions improved and there was surplus food, babies were even born wanting to take her surname, asking her to name their children. The opposing forces criticized her for fostering a cult of personality during the apocalypse, but it didn’t stop many people from calling her the “faith in the ruins.” She just wanted to say, “Stop talking nonsense and get to work.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and picked up a piece of fish maw with her chopsticks, placing it on a bowl of white rice to eat.
 

 
Seeing this, the others finally felt relieved and began to eat along with her.
 

 
The flavor of the underworld was getting stronger and stronger; it wouldn’t surprise her if everyone started calling her “Boss” tomorrow. Tong Zhao silently ate for a while and noticed that the big screen began to play a highlights reel. As everyone's attention shifted to the screen, she quietly asked the director, “I’ll just ask directly, do you need my help with something?”
 

 
With her posture so low, it was either an apology or a request for assistance.
 

 
“Just say it plainly; whether it can be done is my business,” Tong Zhao made her words even more straightforward. Like Duan Ge, she didn’t like beating around the bush or playing guessing games, as it was a waste of time.
 

 
Director Chen showed a moment of surprise, then realized she had misunderstood.
 

 
“How could that be? If I had to say I’m asking you for a favor, it would just be to hope that Sister Zhao can cooperate in various ways during the subsequent promotions and help out with our little show.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, “Of course, as long as it’s not excessive, I will cooperate. Whether I can attend will depend on the specific schedule.”
 

 
Director Chen sighed inwardly; she was right to be popular. From her performances in the variety show, one could see that she had a strong sense of responsibility and an aggressive personality. In person, she was polite and pragmatic. Even though this variety show was like a runaway horse, he still wanted to collaborate with Tong Zhao again…
 

 
Forget it; it was pointless to think about it.
 

 
Of course, he wanted to work with her, but the question was whether he was worthy. He couldn’t even get a meeting.
 

 
“To achieve the desired effect and balance during the show, we’ve been making things difficult for you backstage. We didn’t want you to misunderstand after regaining your memory, thinking we invited you just to target you. So we’ve prepared good food and drink for you; consider it compensation from all of us staff for Sister Zhao.”
 

 
Tong Zhao understood.
 

 
She thought to herself, Sister Zhao isn’t such a petty person…
 

 
Wait, why was she even calling herself “Sister” now!
 

 
Han Zhi: [Hahaha, it’s a bit cute that Sister Zhao is calling herself that.]
 

 
Duan Ge was curious: [I want to see how they’re making things difficult for me.]
 

 
The big screen quickly fulfilled Duan Ge’s wish.
 

 
The footage showed her first lottery draw, pulling out three packs of Master Kong instant noodles labeled "Breakfast," "Lunch," and "Dinner." The director zoomed in, giving her a close-up of her dumbfounded expression.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Hahahaha!]
 

 
Duan Ge: [That’s not too bad; instant noodles were quite common food back in my time, just with low nutritional value.]
 

 
Just as she said it was fine, the next moment, she saw that the instant noodles didn’t have any seasoning packets.
 

 
Duan Ge: [……]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Was that on purpose?]
 

 
Tong Zhao asked Director Chen if this was part of the show’s effect.
 

 
Unexpectedly, the modeler chimed in: “It wasn’t on purpose. When I was writing this segment of code, my cat jumped up and randomly pressed a bunch of keys, and when I deleted the mess, I accidentally deleted a portion that included the seasoning packet code.”
 

 
He showed Tong Zhao the screensaver on his phone, which was a golden gradient fat cat: “This stupid cat is the culprit; it owes Sister Zhao an apology!”
 

 
The cat was just too cute, so Tong Zhao had no choice but to forgive it.
 

 
The remaining exciting clips were pretty standard, mostly showing Duan Ge rampaging and ambushing others. No wonder everyone looked at her with both respect and fear—it's the subconscious effect of variety shows. Even though she herself didn’t seem that fierce, she was still quite intimidating. Some who had already regained their memories were even more afraid of her, like mice seeing a cat, feeling a deep sense of trepidation.
 

 
Later, getting shot in the mall wasn’t too impactful; it was all just headshots.
 

 
The leader of the Cloud Squad, the Thunder Night Watcher, and He Su had practically developed "Fear of Zhao Syndrome."
 

 
Not only did they insist on sitting far away, but they also occasionally glanced over with concerned looks.
 

 
It was too obvious; Tong Zhao found it hard to ignore them.
 

 
Fortunately, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was quite delicious. She poured a generous spoonful of broth over her white rice, so fresh that she forgot about the gazes of those three little cowards.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was a special version made just for her, the quality of the food on the other tables was also decent. Overall, everyone seemed to enjoy the meal, chatting enthusiastically about the entertainment programs—there were quite a few nearby establishments in the film city, including KTV, Werewolf, and script-killing games.
 

 
Director Chen invited her to go to KTV together.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that since she didn’t know anyone in the production team and hadn’t made new friends during the variety show, there was no need to join in the festivities. It would be better to head back to her room to rest and chat with her agent about any new developments during the filming… so she politely declined Director Chen’s invitation: “You all have fun; I want to rest.”
 

 
This time, Director Chen didn’t insist but kindly reminded her that the villa area in the film city offered SPA massage services, and members involved in the variety show could enjoy a half-price discount.
 

 
Tong Zhao was tempted.
 

 
She left a message for her agent, saying she was going for a spa massage and that if Sister Chu needed her, she could call. She could listen while getting the massage. Sister Chu replied with a “Okay, I’ll wait a moment; I’m currently dealing with another artist being caught making out with their assistant.”
 

 
Making out made Tong Zhao laugh: [Is it that serious? Will it be made public? Looks like the only way to bury this news is for me to make out with my assistant too!]
 

 
Her assistant was a girl with a round face, who was also one of her fans.
 

 
Sister Chu replied with a string of frantic gibberish.
 

 
Director Chen’s recommendation was spot on; the SPA services in the film city were very professional, and the service attitude was great. After Tong Zhao explained that she just wanted to rest and didn’t need any conversation, there were no unnecessary words throughout the session. As the therapist began to apply essential oil to Tong Zhao’s back, her phone rang.
 

 
Already prepared, Tong Zhao put on her Bluetooth headset and listened to Sister Chu update her on the latest situation.
 

 
The main point was about the National Studies Martial Arts Hall.
 

 
Sister Chu: “That’s a legitimate big shot. Not only does he hold a high status in the entertainment industry, but he also has considerable influence in politics.” She listed a long string of titles, which sounded dazzling and impressive: “In recent years, he’s taken a liking to young people surfing the internet.”
 

 
Got it, in short, he really appreciated Duan Ge.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “What should I do about that? Are there any dinner parties I can attend?”
 

 
At this, Sister Chu drew in a sharp breath: “Shi Dingjun has invited you to audition for his ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ If you succeed, you should be able to meet the old man… Shi Dingjun is his senior apprentice.”
 

 
“Ah?”
 

 
Tong Zhao had some impression of this director, but it wasn’t very deep.
 

 
After all, he wasn’t the kind of person like Shi Qianqiu, who was always making sensational remarks to the media; the media loved to interview Shi Qianqiu because he always had explosive, candid comments. Director Shi, on the other hand, was a very stable and down-to-earth type. He usually only spoke publicly at formal events, and even if reporters caught him off-guard, they could only get very formal responses.
 

 
As for other matters…
 

 
In any case, no one is interested in the romantic life of a serious middle-aged artist. Director Shi has been married for many years, and at most, there might be a few lines written about his infertility news. However, he has said that his wife has health issues and doesn’t plan to have children; the couple supports each other and plans to live out the next life together. Some audacious reporter provocatively asked, “Doesn’t Director Shi think it’s a pity not to leave any offspring in the world after a hundred years?”
 

 
Shi Dingjun wasn’t angry; he said, “I’ve left behind many great films.”
 

 
Then he smiled slightly:
 

 
“Compared to my ‘bloodline’... ahem, I’m not tall enough at 175 cm, I developed myopia at an early age, and I usually have some issues during annual health checks. I’m not a handsome man; I wouldn’t say my genes are very exceptional. But I can confidently guarantee that every one of my films is an excellent work.”
 

 
This response clearly distinguished him from the reporter.
 

 
Of course, it also put him in a different league compared to Shi Qianqiu, who is famous for being child-free. Tong Zhao had seen reporters ask him the same question. At first, he ignored it, saying he didn’t want to respond to personal matters, but after being pressed, he eventually answered:
 

 
“Alright, then satisfy my desire to be a dad; just call me ‘Dad’ first.”
 

 
The young reporter fell silent.
 

 
Digressing, let’s bring it back.
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled Director Shi Dingjun’s representative works, which were mostly male-centric stories featuring tough men in hard confrontations. During last year’s China Anniversary Celebration, he was invited to shoot a special on martial arts: “The Knives of the Maiden,’ listening to that name, is it about women disguising as men?”
 

 
“Correct, I’m inviting you to audition for the female lead,” Sister Chu said with a hint of pride, “Now you only need to consider the female lead position.”
 

 
“Alright.”
 

 
Although Tong Zhao chooses her own projects, sometimes a good director and a big production can outweigh personal preferences.
 

 
She was quite realistic about this.
 

 
If she wanted to take on heavyweight projects and reap the rewards that the industry focuses on, she didn’t want to hold the title of the box office queen for only half a year; she wanted to stay on the throne indefinitely.
 

 
“Alright, let’s move on to the next topic.”
 

 
Turning the page.
 

 
Next was the previously mentioned, jumpy and accusatory, subpar screenwriter who criticized her for her lack of unique subconscious themes. After the broadcast of "One Life Survivor," he was mocked so much that he turned off comments on his Weibo and went silent. Sister Chu was very indignant: “How can this irrelevant person comment on how diverse our Zhao Zhao’s subconscious is? What does it have to do with him? Isn’t he just jealous that ‘Heartless Tribulation’ exploded in popularity? He should be cursing Shi Qianqiu instead; what does it matter to attack the actors? He deserves the backlash.”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh at that.
 

 
Sister Chu was getting anxious: “Don’t laugh! So many people are waiting to see how good or bad your temper is!”
 

 
Concubine Chen agreed: “Zhao Zhao, your manager is right. When I first entered the palace, some nameless minion provoked me, and the other concubines remained silent, waiting to see my temperament. If you don’t show these kinds of people a lesson, they will just keep going.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was taken aback.
 

 
Show them a lesson? She wasn’t a gang leader.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Alright, I’ll think of a way.”
 

 
For now, she would just get through it.
 

 
“I won’t laugh, I won’t laugh,” Tong Zhao asked, “Is there anything else?”
 

 
That settled it.
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Tong Zhao fully immersed herself back into the massage.
 

 
The hands of the technician were magical; after a while, she fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already completely dark outside. She dragged her relaxed body back to the small villa to continue sleeping, and she slept soundly until the next morning, waking up to meditate, go for a morning run, and take a shower in one go.
 

 
After that, it was no longer her concern; Sister Chu told her to stay home and carefully choose a script.
 

 
The audition for "The Knives of the Maiden" was next week, and before that, she could look at other options.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to pick a gentler script.
 

 
After all, Duan Ge was too ruthless. Originally, she was a beautiful star, and once the edited version of "One Life Survivor" was released, she was afraid she would become widely known, so she needed to balance things out.
 

 
Hey, hey...
 

 
Zhao Zai squeezed half of his head out from the door with the security chain: "Sister, I want to come out and play too."
 

 
He could squeeze his head out, which showed that Tong Zhao’s mental strength had significantly improved after filming the survival variety show.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "You should be good to go after filming one more instinct movie."
 

 
Upon hearing this, Zhao Zai's eyes brightened, and he obediently responded, "Then I'll wait for you, sister."
 

 
Seeing Zhao Zai made Tong Zhao feel quite complex.
 

 
Because it was her younger self, she often wondered... was she really that silly when she was young?
 

 
Her thoughts couldn’t escape the notice of the other personalities, and Zhao Zai puffed up like a little pufferfish: "I'm not silly!"
 

 
Zhao Zai shrank back, sulking.
 

 
[Ah.]
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, the round little head got stuck.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Pfft."
 

 
Empress Chen: "Hahaha..."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Pet the little Zhao."
 

 
In the end, it was Han Zhi who helped push Zhao Zai's half head back in. The little loli's eyes filled with tears, looking aggrieved and withdrawn.
 

 
...
 

 
The edited version of "One Life Survivor" was about to be broadcast.
 

 
The people who would watch the 24-hour livestream were mostly hardcore variety show fans, Tong Zhao's core supporters, and a portion of those with too much free time. The general public mostly waited for the edited version to come out, followed by an official promotion before they would truly engage with the show.
 

 
Promotion was still very important.
 

 
Without promotion, no matter how popular it was, it would only spread in a small circle.
 

 
Many people entered the live stream room, saw the survivors just hanging around waiting to die, and lost interest. It was boring.
 

 
Only the edited version would be worth watching.
 

 
Tong Zhao promised to promote it well, but first, she had to attend the Li Zhi TV gala, which was the most important matter at hand.
 

 
At the gala, she would sing a duet of a traditional love song with Song Wanzhuo—
 

 
Empress Chen made her entrance in a water-red dance dress, playing the guzheng. What a “disobedient” empress, skillfully enticing the audience and the camera. The empress didn’t make overt flirty gestures; rather, every glance, every smile, and every movement exuded charm and allure.
 

 
Not only was the audience thrilled for her, but the director also particularly adored her.
 

 
If it weren't for his rationality, the director would have wanted to give the camera to her entirely.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo?
 

 
It was like the courtiers who had once been enchanted by the empress's beauty, completely forgetting the emperor's presence. When they finally came to their senses, the feudal mindset of having served their whole lives under a hierarchy of lords and subjects was stirred for the first time—why weren’t they the rulers? Only His Majesty deserved to possess such beauty!
 

 
Empress Chen didn’t play the entire time; she only had a solo on the guzheng in the middle.
 

 
She played while Song Wanzhuo sang.
 

 
Once that segment was over, she stood up and began to dance while singing.
 

 
The empress stood on a high platform, her long hair styled in an intricate updo adorned with gold ornaments. Some of it was fake hair, not all of it tied up; her long hair flowed behind her like black seaweed. As she spun lightly, the ends of her hair created a captivating arc… Even the audience seated in the back row felt far away from her, yet they seemed to have truly caught a whiff of her hair's fragrance, showing expressions of intoxication.
 

 
The silk draped over her hands swayed as she danced, the gauze adorned with tiny sequins, resembling a stream of flowing light that made it hard for anyone to look away.
 

 
The live audience and the viewers online were all ordinary men, so it was normal for them to have weak self-control.
 

 
However, upon closer observation, the audience members who weren't mesmerized noticed...
 

 
Even Song Wanzhuo, who was supposed to interact with the camera, was totally focused on Tong Zhao!
 

 
His gaze was glued to her, unmoving, with a tipsy smile lingering at the corners of his mouth.
 

 
Seeing this scene, the agent felt like his heart had died and was filled with frustration—having already been outshined by her and stolen the spotlight, how could he be so careless too? Once the performance ended and they were backstage, the agent pulled him aside and asked, "My Wanzhuo, what were you smiling about? You were staring at her the whole time; it was so obvious!"
 

 
"I know,"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo momentarily felt guilty and showed a reluctant expression. "Ah, you don’t understand. You’re too far away. When I was in that position, I could smell her sweet fragrance every time she made a big movement."
 

 
"…"
 

 
The agent looked at his expression and thought he didn’t seem to have just smelled her fragrance.
 

 
He looked as if he had been bewitched, seriously affected.
 

 
That night, a reporter indeed asked him. The question was subtle; the reporter mentioned that there were many comments in the live stream about him constantly looking at Tong Zhao. Was that true?
 

 
Song Wanzhuo cleared his throat and explained seriously, "That’s because everyone watching us collaborate just wants to reminisce about ‘Ming Emperor’. When I was singing, my mindset shifted to that of the Ming Emperor; it was the Ming Emperor who wanted to see the empress, not me."
 

 
Reporter: ???
 

 
We totally believe you!
 

 
On Tong Zhao’s side, things were much more normal. Just as she was waiting for a reporter to ask her if she would consider acting in a palace drama, she said, "Everyone has too fixed an impression of me. You can check out my upcoming show, ‘One Life Survivor’, where you’ll see a different side of me, and it’s quite charming."
 

 
[Zhao Zhao's advertising seems a bit stiff, but she’s pretty, so I forgive her.]
 

 
[Wow, that’s a hard sell!]
 

 
There were also some clueless onlookers: [How different can it be? But I really want to see such a delicate and beautiful ancient-style beauty~]
# Chapter76
The gala is a battleground fiercely contested by TV stations.
 

 
Each station is gearing up to compete for ratings, preparing meticulously during the buildup, with a shining list of preview programs rolling by alongside the names of stars and celebrities, accompanied by lively and intense music, aiming to leave a memorable impression on viewers so they tune in at the right time.
 

 
Higher ratings mean that advertising slots can be sold at even higher prices.
 

 
Riding the tailwind of the recent airing of "Heartless Tribulation," Tong Zhao is still the most impressive female star this season, and many people are looking forward to her appearance in historical costume. When the audience learned that she would attend the Li Zhi TV gala in traditional attire, many became interested and switched to Li Zhi TV, eager to relive the essence of the Mu Xian Chang.
 

 
Instead of seeing the proud plum blossom against the snowy mountains, they were greeted with a vibrant and blooming begonia.
 

 
The audience was immediately stunned.
 

 
Then, as soon as Tong Zhao started to sing, they could no longer bear to change the channel.
 

 
Her voice was genuinely enchanting; when she sang ancient-style love songs, it was especially captivating.
 

 
Tong Zhao resembled a beautiful courtesan used to singing melodious verses for the emperor, each syllable teasingly dancing like fingertips painted with rouge against the chest, leaving the audience feeling a delightful tingling sensation. Could viewers experience such imperial-level enjoyment on other channels?
 

 
No, it was unique—no one wanted to change the channel!
 

 
Many viewers watched the gala like this—constantly flipping channels, glancing at this show and that, until they became entranced by one program, while more often than not, no program could hold their attention. Aside from the segments featuring their idols, they merely skimmed through everything else, as if they had seen it all and yet had seen nothing at all.
 

 
However, with a single note and a charming smile, Tong Zhao captivated the attention of this group of fickle admirers.
 

 
[Help, this isn't the Mu Xian Chang I wanted to see.]
 

 
[But it's so engaging! Can that guy next to her just let her shine? Let my wife be the only beauty.]
 

 
[Don’t pull her down; their relationship is really good.]
 

 
[The immersion is strong; when Zhao Zhao smiles at me, I feel like I'm the emperor!]
 

 
As a result, the ratings for the Li Zhi TV gala skyrocketed.
 

 
It surged in a unique way, with particularly high retention rates during their duet.
 

 
The number of comments mentioning Tong Zhao far exceeded those for Song Wanzhuo, highlighting the stark contrast between the strong female lead and the weaker male counterpart, which was a bit lamentable.
 

 
This data couldn’t be hidden. When the gala supervisor at Li Zhi TV saw this—
 

 
Wow, Little Sister Zhao is definitely going to demand a higher price next year.
 

 
They should really pat themselves on the back for having the foresight to invite her this time; the only regret is not placing her in the prime time slot. It was aired too early; if it had been during peak viewing hours, she would have surely overshadowed the competition on other channels!
 

 
When analyzing the profits, the industry’s eyes became incredibly sharp. People began to murmur about how Tong Zhao is explosive in everything she does. Could she really be the so-called "Ziweixing" of the entertainment industry? After making a splash in a drama with a high-end supporting role, her movies keep getting hotter, and the variety show "Sea King Kill" has attracted significant attention. Now she’s taking the stage at the gala… great, she’s outshining everyone!
 

 
The benefits brought by Tong Zhao were too obvious.
 

 
A simple and brutal logic chain was deeply etched in the minds of the executives of various TV stations and brands—
 

 
The audience loves watching Tong Zhao, and Tong Zhao has a lot of buzz. Whatever she shoots becomes a hit—
 

 
No matter how much she charges, booking her is a guaranteed profit!
 

 
In the undercurrents, her worth has risen another level—
 

 
This status will hold until her next stumble.
 

 
The industry is now focused on the edited version of "One Life Survivor," which will air tomorrow. Coincidentally, aside from needing to purchase viewing rights for the holographic version online, the exclusive broadcast rights for the traditional version belong to Li Zhi TV, indicating that the station has a good relationship with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Is this Tong Zhao achieving new heights in the variety show realm, or is it a repeat of a failure?
 

 
The backstage staff of "One Life Survivor" were moved to see her advertising their show at the gala and went wild, enthusiastically supporting her in their WeChat group.
 

 
What does it mean to be dedicated? This is what dedication looks like!
 

 
After the gala, during Tong Zhao's short holiday, she lounged at home with nothing to do, flipping through scripts every day and watching with her other personalities, checking if there was something she wanted to perform, especially the female reporter. She had been awake for so long and hadn’t appeared yet.
 

 
Han Zhi: “Shu Yi is suitable for more nuanced, serious dramas, but they often get good reviews without box office success.”
 

 
The female reporter’s name is Shen Shu Yi.
 

 
The mission of the female reporter is to deliver three valuable news articles. The first is about the sentiments of a smaller nation caught between two warring superpowers, promoting anti-war sentiments. The second is about the East's indiscriminate whaling and the need for environmental protection. The last one focuses on the female soldiers who have been overlooked in history during wartime, reporting on their sacrifices and struggles in defending the homeland, highlighting that their sacrifices are equally heroic and detailing the hardships faced during their campaigns.
 

 
This can be considered a more meaningful and profound world that Tong Zhao has experienced.
 

 
Female Reporter: "The film I made might not sell well; it’s too dark. Let Zhao Zhao develop further."
 

 
She said softly.
 

 
At that time, Shu Yi submitted her first news article, which moved many people and contributed significantly to the systematic recognition of the two countries' ceasefire. However, she inevitably fell into a depression, which worsened over time until she completed her mission, temporarily sealing away the memories of this world to recuperate.
 

 
The more she confronted the vast amounts of pain, the more she felt her own insignificance.
 

 
So sometimes she would forget her own name, becoming a tool for documenting the suffering of others.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted her: "It’s okay; it’s not like you have to use box office sales to pay rent. Just relax and stay in my mind."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Let’s take a look at other scripts."
 

 
Just as she was flipping open the next one, Tong Zhao received a voice message from the Ze Shan WeChat group.
 

 
This group is incredible; every day there are tons of messages, half work and half fun. Tong Zhao was puzzled about how they managed to find the information they wanted from it. In any case, as long as it didn't hinder their work, she let them be. Any important updates would be sent to her privately, and she would occasionally check in to see what they were chatting about, which usually revolved around eating, drinking, and having fun.
 

 
Sometimes Tong Zhao would doubt that this group gathered the most hedonistic people in the city.
 

 
What was this voice message about?
 

 
As soon as she clicked in, her friends noticed her profile picture had appeared and immediately cheerfully called out to her: "Sister Zhao, Boss Wei is organizing a movie screening! Are you coming?"
 

 
"A movie screening? What are we watching?" she asked, even more confused.
 

 
For this group of people, a movie screening was far too subdued.
 

 
Racing dirt bikes in an off-road vehicle park suited their style much better, especially if it could be done in a rainstorm during a typhoon, giving off that melodramatic feel reminiscent of "Thunderstorm."
 

 
"'One Life Survivor' is airing tomorrow, right? Let’s watch it together!"
 

 
"……"
 

 
They seemed quite enthusiastic.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Okay. Send me the address. Is it still at Wei's place?"
 

 
"Yes, yes, yes."
 

 
"Sister Zhao has to come!"
 

 
"Does this count as a large figurine that can talk and walk…"
 

 
"Tonight, we’re all fans of Sister Zhao!"
 

 
The voice messages were particularly lively.
 

 
Though they said it would be at Wei's, the address had changed.
 

 
Another second-generation girl said they wanted to have a barbecue by the beach this time, so they switched to a mansion under the Wei family that had a private beach.
 

 
This group of friends became Tong Zhao’s true companions after her return. No matter how childish their invitations were, as long as she could spare the time, she would attend. She promptly scheduled an appointment on her calendar; no other activity invitation mattered.
 

 
It was only when she was playing with them that Tong Zhao truly felt she was living among people.
 

 
The movie screening ultimately turned into a semi-swimwear party.
 

 
The men wore swim trunks and the women wore bikinis. Tong Zhao, following the local customs, wore a swimsuit, but she still had the most fabric on among the attendees.
 

 
From the front, she appeared in a snow-white lace-trimmed dress with a sheer camisole and a short skirt, while the back featured several straps tied into a bow. She looked ethereal and cute, perfectly matching her fresh and charming appearance.
 

 
This movie screening didn't have any parents present. The second-generation crowd brought their girlfriends along, all of whom were little stars that Tong Zhao couldn’t name. When she nodded at them, they displayed expressions of being flattered and starstruck, which felt even more rewarding than receiving a kiss from a rich boyfriend.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that her time in the industry wasn’t very long, but among her contemporaries and newcomers, she was seen as a star of destiny.
 

 
It was impossible to secretly ride her coattails.
 

 
If you offended Sister Zhao and this group of second-generation kids, you wouldn't gain any popularity and would likely end up getting sidelined. A hard-won wealthy boyfriend might even ditch you.
 

 
So at least they could share some good fortune!
 

 
Then Tong Zhao noticed that there was a professional chef helping the young ladies and gentlemen with the barbecue. These beautiful girls personally grilled chicken wings and beef tongue and brought them to Tong Zhao. They also had the inside scoop that she would be coming today, so they prepared some small cakes in advance.
 

 
To be honest, the food was quite tasty...
 

 
The girls’ affection and kindness felt genuine; there were no malicious palace intrigue tricks involved.
 

 
Thanks to their enthusiasm, Tong Zhao's mouth was constantly busy. She found it curious: “Why are you only grilling for me?”
 

 
Lu Shao was one of the second-generation kids, looking at his Sister Zhao with a pitiful expression.
 

 
The second-generation kids she associated with didn’t disrespect girls; even the small-time influencers who sought to benefit from their relationships were no different.
 

 
The young lady seemed a bit shy: “I have an audition next week and want to ride on Sister Zhao’s good luck.”
 

 
“Me too!”
 

 
“If it weren't impolite, I would have wanted to bow to Sister Zhao.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
So, it turns out that these chicken wings and small cakes are offerings.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and took her hand, intertwining their fingers as she said, “Come on, I’ll share some good luck with you.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was joking, but the other girls clearly took it seriously. They eagerly wanted to hold her hand, and it wasn’t until all the girls had held her hand that it was over. After soaking up the good luck, they were taken away by their boyfriends to play beach volleyball. Tong Zhao didn’t want to get in the water, so she applied sunscreen and lay down under a sun umbrella, enjoying the food grilled by the beautiful young ladies.
 

 
Wei Zekai plopped down next to her, fuming, “They shouldn’t have brought their girlfriends!”
 

 
“I think they’re all pretty normal girls. Why didn’t I know you were misandrist?” Tong Zhao wondered.
 

 
“I’m not misandrist. Why would I be?!”
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow in confusion, revealing his true thoughts: “They were surrounding you just now, and I couldn’t squeeze in.”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned over in her lounge chair and smiled at him: “Do you also want to ride on my good luck? No way; your luck is already one in a billion. Wanting even more good fortune would be greedy.”
 

 
“They grilled so much food for you; you must be full now. I was going to grill some for you too.”
 

 
It was clear that Young Master Wei had a distorted view of his own position.
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled Wei Zekai's cooking skills during "Sea King Kill" and thought that being full wasn't necessarily a bad thing. She chuckled and ruffled his gray hair. He had been so busy with venture capital that he hadn’t had time to play around, but he had still managed to get a stylish gray hairstyle, calling it “turning gray overnight for the company.” “I’m full, but you’re not, right?”
 

 
Wei Zekai replied, “I’m just filled with anger.”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked, “Then you can’t eat what I grilled?”
 

 
Wei Zekai smirked, “All of a sudden, I can.”
 

 
Young Master Wei's principles were as fragile as paper, bending at the slightest breeze.
 

 
Tong Zhao got up from her lounge chair. She was too lazy to grill anything that took a long time, so she just tore open a bag of Rocky Mountain marshmallows, threaded them onto sticks, and slowly roasted them over the grill. She was a pro at roasting marshmallows, perfectly controlling the heat so that the inside melted into a gooey mess while the outside had a dry, sweet crust, reminiscent of a candy skin. It was easy to pinch with two fingers, giving the marshmallow a "striptease."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at her with disdain, “That looks really sweet.”
 

 
“Eat it or don’t.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pinched out a perfectly roasted marshmallow and shoved it into his mouth. He immediately opened up like a little sea lion being fed, obediently taking a bite.
 

 
The roasted marshmallow tasted even sweeter and was sticky. It quickly stuck to Young Master Wei's mouth, who was usually full of talk and chatter.
 

 
The group playing volleyball on the beach turned to witness this scene, with a little influencer gasping and covering her face, “Is Wei Zekai really dating Sister Zhao? I won't tell anyone! But it's kind of sweet.” Her words were laced with envy.
 

 
Second Generation A: “Huh? Dating?”
 

 
Second Generation B: “Do you think they look like a couple?”
 

 
Just then, Tong Zhao finished roasting another stick of marshmallows to “refill” him.
 

 
Both the feeder and the fed were quite skilled, taking turns to eat one marshmallow at a time.
 

 
Second Generation C asked, “What should we call this? The joys of family?”
 

 
Second Generation D chimed in, “The Queen and her dog?”
 

 
The group of second-generation kids responded in unison, “Wow, that’s spot on!”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The pretty girls didn’t quite understand the thought processes of these second-generation kids.
 

 
After finishing their volleyball game, everyone took showers in the luxurious mansion and comfortably lounged in the screening room, munching on popcorn and enjoying their sugary drinks while waiting for the show to start. The opening featured a segment that gave off a strong cyber-game vibe, and many of the casual viewers drawn in by Tong Zhao were instantly confused:
 

 
[Is this an apocalypse movie? It doesn’t seem suitable for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Anyone who says it’s not suitable for Tong Zhao clearly hasn’t seen “Countdown 72 Hours.”]
 

 
[Friends from the Li Zhi TV gala, give me a thumbs up! I’m your organization!]
 

 
The comments flooded the screen, all asking about Tong Zhao.
 

 
She hadn’t even appeared yet, but her presence was already overwhelming.
 

 
Next, Tong Zhao made her entrance. The editing showcased a scene of her stepping out from crumbling ruins, her pale, well-defined legs hidden within military boots, which accentuated their elegant shape. The camera panned upwards, and some quick-thinking audience members turned off the comments to avoid being overwhelmed by a flood of compliments that would obscure Tong Zhao’s beauty.
 

 
She really looked stunning.
 

 
In the darkness, Tong Zhao felt many pairs of eyes turning to look at her: “What are you looking at? Watch the show!”
 

 
“It’s obvious that she looks beautiful on camera, but she’s even more stunning in person.” One of the internet celebrity girls spoke with a slightly downcast tone, but it was a heartfelt compliment.
 

 
How can anyone else live when she’s this beautiful?
 

 
She really does seem to come with a beauty filter built in.
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded in agreement, “Absolutely.”
 

 
“You're all praising me like I’ve paid you to do so.”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt helpless as Wei Zekai leaned closer, and she lightly tapped his head.
 

 
The production team initially thought the popularity gained from the Li Zhi TV gala would be fleeting, especially since the contrast in her image was so stark. People were expecting a glamorous and enchanting queen, only to find a cold, ruthless assassin instead. The audience demographics were completely different.
 

 
However, according to the backstage data, these viewers hadn’t left.
 

 
They continued watching.
 

 
The staff couldn’t quite grasp that these viewers were not merely fans of glamorous beauties; they were senior members of the “appearance association,” and all beings were equal. Yet this equality was exclusive to good-looking people.
 

 
The edited version had a brisk pace. It started with the Sun Squad searching for supplies in a McDonald’s, then hinted that the Cloud Squad was about to arrive. After establishing the physical positions of the two teams, the camera immediately zoomed in on Tong Zhao from a high angle.
 

 
Just the scene where she cut her long hair sparked a flurry of excited comments:
 

 
[So cool!]
 

 
[Sister, your short hair looks great too! Consider going this route next time?]
 

 
[I’ll never ask to see Tong Zhao in ancient costumes again; let’s have some workplace dramas! I want to see short-haired Zhao!]
 

 
Tong Zhao's first parkour segment was accompanied by the background music “Sold Out.” She navigated through high-rise buildings, cutting out unnecessary shots, with a quick and uplifting rhythm that stirred the audience's emotions. The powerful beat accompanied each difficult combination of moves, reaching a small climax as she leapt between two buildings.
 

 
What a fantastic visual treat!
 

 
No wonder they say Tong Zhao is a star who brings the excitement with her.
 

 
Who can perform such moves in instinctive variety shows? Who can? No one in the industry would dare claim they could, and Tong Zhao didn’t boast about her abilities in advance either. She effortlessly showcased a classic segment, as simple as picking up chopsticks.
 

 
There are already comments saying Tong Zhao's escape scene could be accompanied by “Hit and Run.”
 

 
Viewers who hadn't paid attention to the live broadcast were like explorers discovering a new continent. They eagerly spread the word on Weibo, in their friend circles, and on any social platform they could reach, practically bursting to tell everyone they had found a treasure of a star, especially among male viewers:
 

 
[Yooooooo! So cool!]
 

 
[Have you ever seen a female star in domestic entertainment who can parkour? Her core strength is insane.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, YYDS (forever a legend)!]
 

 
Some male viewers weren’t as sleazy as the stereotypes suggest; sometimes they were quite innocent. Seeing an enormous, moving robot excited them, and now seeing Tong Zhao filled them with the same thrill. She was just too cool, and they felt they had to share their excitement with friends to calm down.
 

 
At this moment, her companions all turned to look at her at once.
 

 
Their eyes were filled with the expectation of “Can you show us that?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...No, I can't.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Now that you want to see me parkour, when you see me fight four opponents later, do you want me to show off then too?”
 

 
Just then, the big screen displayed Tong Zhao lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.
 

 
As the Sun Squad escaped and the Cloud Squad was about to chase after them, the screen paused for a moment, surrounded by a red glow.
 

 
“Warning: High Energy Ahead!”
 

 
“Summoning Barrage for Protection!”
 

 
“Friends who are scared, put up your defenses on the screen!”
 

 
Next came the scene where Tong Zhao fought four opponents, shocking the unprepared ordinary viewers to the core.
 

 
[Is this even real??????]
 

 
[Holy crap, this feels crazier than a movie! How is her performance even more intense than Feng Yanqi's?]
 

 
[The key is that she doesn’t seem nervous or afraid at all. I suspect she has high-functioning antisocial personality traits.]
 

 
Director Chen knew that the highlight of the entire variety show was Tong Zhao. Whenever she performed, he put all his efforts into editing. Take this segment of her fighting four opponents as an example: the original footage might have been less than three minutes long, but they held a two-hour high-intensity meeting to brainstorm. Almost every shot was examined carefully to figure out how to make it perfect.
 

 
Their hard work paid off; the released segment indeed had an exceptional effect.
 

 
Not only were Tong Zhao's combat intentions clearly conveyed, but she was also filmed beautifully, rivaling serious action movies.
 

 
Professionals look at the technique, while amateurs look at the effect.
 

 
Just this one segment could hold the attention of shocked viewers for at least fifteen minutes—this is how the film and television industry works. Content must be meticulously crafted; otherwise, why would viewers choose to spend their precious time watching it? Programs that attempt to deceive the audience will be abandoned, and the opposite is true as well.
 

 
These fifteen minutes showcased the clashes of the other two teams, and just when the program estimated the audience's patience was about to run out, it immediately threw Tong Zhao into the spotlight to captivate the viewers.
 

 
As Tong Zhao exchanged three bags of Master Kong instant noodles, the noodles still lacking seasoning packets, the comments on the screen erupted with laughter, sounding like pig squeals.
 

 
Quick-fingered netizens quickly posted on Weibo, sharing meme templates:
 

 
[Tong Zhao looking dumbfounded.jpg], [Are you serious.jpg], and [Tong Zhao looking humble.jpg] were all too useful. Some viewers used these adorable emojis to lure newcomers into the fandom, spreading like a viral sensation. This time, the viewing threshold was lower than during the 24-hour live stream, leading to a rapid increase in the number of new viewers on Weibo.
 

 
As they poured in, the show had just reached the part where the Sun Squad and Thunder Squad returned to McDonald's, only to find a battlefield littered with corpses.
 

 
A huge special effects banner floated across the screen:
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Carefully Crafted Work~~~~”
 

 
Ah, this.
 

 
Where’s the promised cute and silly girl?
 

 
This is way too brutal!
 

 
An interesting discussion thread appeared on a certain entertainment forum: “Is Tong Zhao Really Silly and Cute?”
 

 
A user on the first floor concluded the thread: [Newcomers who fell for Tong Zhao's supposed silliness are the most naive…]
 

 
The guests began a serious round of deduction, giving the audience a big sense of intellectual superiority. Watching film and television works is sometimes thrilling precisely because of the god's perspective, allowing viewers to point and comment on the characters in the show.
 

 
At that moment, the camera zoomed up to the edge of the rooftop of a tall building.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat at the edge of the rooftop, gently swinging her legs—
 

 
[Tong Zhao seems like an elf that has descended to Earth.]
 

 
[An elf that can kill an entire family?]
 

 
[Well, when she’s not making a move, she’s still very obedient.]
 

 
This episode abruptly ended when she spotted the Thunder and Sun squads.
 

 
As the screen went black, the audience, who had been discussing the variety show, suddenly erupted in disappointment, all exclaiming that they hadn’t had enough. "What happened next? There’s nothing more?! We have to wait until the day after tomorrow? We don’t want to wait!"
 

 
A small portion rushed to watch the 24-hour recorded version, but most decided to wait for the second episode in two days.
 

 
In any case, this variety show was definitely going to be followed!
 

 
The production team had no money to buy trending searches, so they could only do their best to edit the original footage into something more exciting and appealing. Fortunately, they delivered a high-quality product, and Tong Zhao also contributed to the corresponding buzz—three related topics suddenly appeared on the trending list, each one featuring her name prominently. Savvy netizens noted that this show not only featured individual survival but also relied on her to carry the ratings.
 

 
What everyone was most curious about was where Tong Zhao acquired so many bizarre skills.
 

 
If you say she can sing and play instruments?
 

 
That’s normal; Tong Zhao comes from a good family, even if she encountered a bad father and a mistress.
 

 
If you say she knows martial arts?
 

 
Well… that could be somewhat acceptable. It’s part of traditional culture, good for health, nothing to be embarrassed about.
 

 
But what Tong Zhao clearly knows is the art of killing!
 

 
Who could develop such skills without training in a special forces camp for several years? The key lies in her mindset during that one-against-four situation—most people simply don’t possess that. Even those in special professions don’t have it. Moreover, due to her family's involvement in the gray market and their dark lineage, there are already discussions on Zhihu about her identity as a daughter of the underworld…
 

 
The level of discussion was astonishingly high, so her manager, Sister Chu, suggested that she consider responding.
 

 
Recollections?
 

 
That meant she needed to come up with an excuse to brush it off…
 

 
She couldn’t just say she practiced by killing zombies, could she?
 

 
Duan Ge: “Actually, I’ve killed people too.”
 

 
In the apocalypse, in order to protect certain vulnerable female characters, her hands were stained with blood. Sometimes, Duan Ge would feel that some living people were scarier than zombies.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Stop, I don’t really want to recall that.”
 

 
After thinking for a moment, Tong Zhao decided to go live on Bilibili, which the company had registered for her—her first stream in ages.
 

 
It was a gaming livestream.
# Chapter77
After adjusting the camera, Tong Zhao posted a message on Weibo:
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
Streaming for a bit. [Bilibili stream link]
 

 
[Is Sis doing a live stream? Why not on Weibo?]
 

 
[Feels like the dimension wall has been broken...]
 

 
[Zhao's become a mature streamer, already knows how to promote herself!]
 

 
The first episode of ‘One Life Survivor’ had just aired, and the audience was left wanting more. A bunch of "variety show refugees" were venting their excitement on Weibo, forums, Zhihu, and their social media feeds. Many were even leaving confessions under her previous Weibo posts. In short, there were plenty of netizens lurking under her posts, and when a new one popped up, they excitedly rushed to comment in the first row.
 

 
But refreshing it? Well, no chance of being in the first row now.
 

 
With one refresh, thousands of comments had already flooded in!
 

 
Following the link Tong Zhao provided, fans clicked into the stream, expecting to be visually stunned by her beauty. However, they found that her face only took up a small corner of the screen, about the size of a palm in the bottom right. Tong Zhao was sitting in a pink bunny-themed gaming chair, her hair tied loosely in a bun. Her pair of beautiful almond-shaped eyes weren’t looking at the camera but at something ahead—likely her computer screen.
 

 
She was very focused.
 

 
No distracted smiles for the audience, nor any seductive glances like at the gala.
 

 
Yet even without filters, her well-defined features easily outshone a whole district of female streamers.
 

 
She's too beautiful, making people sigh in awe. No wonder she's a celebrity; she's on a completely different level from internet influencers. When on the same platform, it feels like she's effortlessly outshining them. However, this dominance isn't as noticeable on Bilibili, where many viewers are fans of virtual streamers, which has led to memes like "[VTB Simps Are Among Us.jpg]".
 

 
“Ah, it’s all set,” she said.
 

 
As soon as she spoke, the screen of Tong Zhao's computer appeared in the livestream.
 

 
It was a game.
 

 
Specifically, ‘PUBG’, which is popular worldwide. The male character on-screen looked quite flashy, wearing a leopard-print face scarf and a Leather Hoodie jacket—clearly an expensive outfit. Tong Zhao not only plays games but plays them well. Part of it is due to often playing with Wei Zekai in the past, but another part is her natural talent.
 

 
In many ways, Tong Zhao is a bit of a polymath.
 

 
Otherwise, how could she repeatedly succeed in clearing different worlds in the fast-travel genre?
 

 
Even though she plays well, Tong Zhao rarely spends money on in-game purchases. This outfit was part of a “team uniform” that Wei Zekai had bought for their group. The black-clad look was just his style, exuding an air of wealth. He’s the type of person who, in ‘CS:GO’, would wield a brand-new blue-flamed karambit knife paired with a dragon-themed sniper rifle, flaunting his financial prowess.
 

 
Fans and viewers were stunned.
 

 
What was happening?
 

 
Tong Zhao streaming a game? And it's ‘PUBG’?
 

 
The information overload left the audience a bit overwhelmed.
 

 
Tong Zhao started a match right away and casually chatted with viewers during the loading time: "I saw a lot of people discussing why my instinctive shooting skills seem so good, and why I stay so calm. I figured I'd show you all in action and clear up the confusion."
 

 
After she explained, the viewers were even more puzzled.
 

 
The chat was flooded with questions:
 

 
[Zhao Zhao, what does playing games have to do with instinctive shooting skills?]
 
[Sis, are you trying to say you honed your shooting skills from playing PUBG?]
 
[I don't believe it! There's no way this theory is true! The forum pros can't be right!]
 

 
The so-called bragging from forums like Tieba and Zhihu, if all of it were true, China would have unified the world by now. Some overconfident kids talk big on forums, citing their achievements in shooting games, fantasizing that if they were on a real battlefield, they'd definitely dominate.
 

 
Of course, that's impossible.
 

 
In reality, the recoil from a real gun would be enough to humble these kids who can barely lift a grocery bag.
 

 
The live-streaming site Tong Zhao picked was well-suited for this kind of crowd. The viewers in the comments were savvy and started playing along with the jokes.
 

 
[Everyone shut up! You can't compare everyone's physical ability the same way. Zhao Zhao once took on eleven strong men by herself in a fit of extreme rage.]
 
[So what? I became her fan the day she slid tackled a tiger to death. That move was legendary.]
 
[Totally normal. Do you know why American soldiers are so tough? They train by playing PUBG on Steam with pro gamers. Their coordination comes from playing ‘Human: Fall Flat’, and their strategic backstabbing from ‘Fall Guys’.]
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the chat and was amused.
 

 
When she smiled, the slight upward curve of her eyes gave off an unconscious hint of allure.
 

 
Whoa.
 

 
Beauty attack!
 

 
Viewers started begging for the camera feed to be enlarged, asking if the mods could zoom in on her face.
 

 
But that wasn’t happening—Tong Zhao was seriously focused on streaming her game.
 

 
“Hello? Hello? Is the random teammate a guy or a girl?”
 
“Damn, it’s hilarious that we have to fill our squad with randoms because Nan Nan bailed last minute.”
 

 
"He’s talking nonsense again, probably watching a virtual streamer."
 

 
From just these few words, it was clear that the three random teammates had originally intended to play as a four-person squad, but one of them bailed last minute, leaving a spot open for Tong Zhao to fill.
 

 
Upon hearing the male voice in the game, her fans in the livestream immediately felt a mix of excitement and jealousy.
 

 
Playing a game with Tong Zhao?!
 
What kind of godly luck was that? Incredible.
 

 
Many comments were saying that if they could duo with Tong Zhao, they’d pay any amount of money for it.
 

 
“I accidentally queued into a four-player squad…”
 

 
Tong Zhao said, “You don’t need to spend money to play with me. If you get matched with me, we’ll play together.”
 

 
But the reality is, who’s going to get matched with her?
 

 
With her current level of fame, she could indeed make such a statement—after all, if playing with her had a price tag, that would be more like a paid companion, which would feel beneath her. Fans may joke about paying to play, but deep down they wanted their idol to be priceless.
 

 
Meanwhile, the three male players, unaware that they were the target of thousands of people's envy, kept joking around: “How could we be so lucky to get a girl on our team? A girl solo-queuing in a four-player squad? Not having a protector is just unscientific!”
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t turned on her in-game mic, only speaking to the viewers: “I accidentally queued for a squad game, so I’ll just play solo for now. I’ll only talk if communication becomes necessary.”
 

 
After a brief pause, she added:
 

 
“I haven’t played much this season, so the difficulty of the match will be lower. I won’t need to talk.”
 

 
As long as one member of the team survives until the end, the whole squad wins.
 

 
“Why won’t you need to talk?”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled lightly and said casually, “Because I play pretty well.”
 

 
The viewers at that moment had no idea that this game was about to redefine what “playing pretty well” meant…
 

 
The flight path was from the airport to the upper city. While on the plane, Tong Zhao quietly listened to her three teammates chatting via voice.
 

 
Player 2 was giving instructions: “Let’s head to Novo to scavenge. There won’t be many people up there since the flight path is away from it. We’ll loot and see what happens next.”
 

 
The other two responded with a chorus of "yeah, yeah."
 

 
Tong Zhao, wanting to engage with her fans a bit, asked the viewers in the chat where they’d like to see her jump.
 

 
Compared to other celebrities, she didn’t interact with her fans as frequently, which inadvertently helped her maintain a higher profile. Still, she genuinely liked and valued her fans. Handshake events weren’t her style, but she tried to make the most of opportunities to interact with them.
 

 
The chat asked her to jump at the airport.
 

 
She chuckled softly, “Alright.”
 

 
Her soft, feminine voice, transmitted through top-tier sound equipment, caressed the ears of all the viewers.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao was jumping into the high-risk airport area without saying a word or communicating with the team, Player 2 started complaining: “Another silent player jumping into the airport to get killed. Looks like we’re going to have to sneak through the zone to survive again, just to scrape some points. Playing as three with a random is too tough… Next game, we’re definitely pulling Nan Nan back in.”
 

 
The fans were in disbelief—how could they diss their goddess like that?!
 

 
Confused comments flooded the chat, but Tong Zhao calmly replied, “No need for question marks, they’re fine. I’m the one who didn’t turn on my mic. I just wanted to chat with you all first.”
 

 
Indeed, if you got matched with a random player who didn’t communicate, you’d feel annoyed too.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s words soothed both the PUBG players and her biased fans.
 

 
No one could stay mad after that—Tong Zhao had just said she wanted to chat with them!
 

 
Because of the rich resources, if the airport is along the flight path, players typically face around 30 to 40 opponents upon landing. However, with a recent update reducing the loot at the airport, fewer people jumped there, though there were still three to four teams, about 20 players in total.
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao’s parachute landed on the tech building, and she began searching for equipment.
 

 
Surprisingly, she didn’t encounter an entire squad inside. Instead, she came across a lone player on the second floor who had been separated from his team. She quickly picked up an UMP9 and took him out with ease, then jokingly commented, “Why is there only one? Where are his teammates? Give me some action!”
 

 
As soon as she made her first move, the viewers could tell she knew how to play.
 

 
Many curious onlookers, who came just for the spectacle, began to wonder how well this actress could really play.
 

 
“The players in this match seem like noobs. Their aim doesn’t seem great. Looks like it’s a beginners’ match,” Tong Zhao said calmly, her tone carrying a soft, amused smile.
 

 
It was as if she wasn’t in a deadly battlefield, but rather playing a peaceful idle game.
 

 
Some fans who didn’t understand the game were utterly charmed by how she called them "little kids."
 

 
Gunshots continued to ring out nearby. When Tong Zhao arrived at the scene, she couldn’t see anyone and muttered in confusion, “It’s like they’re just shooting for fun. When I need someone, there’s no one around.”
 

 
No sooner had she said this than she was shot in the back.
 

 
Before the audience could react, Tong Zhao had already swiftly turned, found cover behind a door, and quickly eliminated the ambusher with a few shots. Though her health had dropped significantly, she remained unhurried: “Now his teammates will come. What should we do?”
 

 
She calmly closed the door and started healing by a window without finishing off the downed player.
 

 
The chat exploded with viewers urging her to finish off the enemy first, because in the game, downed players don’t die instantly if their teammates are still alive.
 

 
At this point, if the ambusher's teammates rushed over and killed Tong Zhao, they could still revive the injured player.
 

 
It's common sense to finish off an enemy after downing them.
 

 
Of course, healing takes time, and using medicine when injured is normal.
 

 
However, she interrupted her healing just after starting, without waiting for it to complete.
 

 
After performing this series of seemingly confusing actions to regular viewers and low-ranked players, she explained:
 

 
"When this ambusher dies, there’s a death cam that allows his teammates to see how he was killed. In that replay, they can also see my actions... If his teammates see me healing, what would they think?"
 

 
"They’d probably tell their team, 'She’s low on health! She's healing near my loot box! Hurry up and kill her to revive me!' ... Something like that."
 

 
"I timed it right. I jumped out the window just after their death cam ended."
 

 
"To these three teammates, I probably look like some clueless newbie still healing next to the body."
 

 
Just as she finished speaking, the sound of hurried footsteps grew louder.
 

 
"Look, they took the bait."
 

 
Tong Zhao quickly vaulted out the window, tossing a grenade back into the room. It blew up the first enemy who had jumped in from the adjacent room—let's call him Gourd Baby #1. Gourd Baby #2 then rushed in to try and revive him, while Gourd Baby #3 waited by the door, only to be stealthily taken out by Tong Zhao as she sneaked up using the shift key to move quietly. Inside, Gourd Baby #2 was desperately trying to revive his teammate…
 

 
Just two more seconds, and he’d have revived his ally, turning the fight into a 2v1!
 

 
However, what awaited Gourd Baby #2 was a grenade that had been cooking for two seconds.
 

 
Boom!
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled at the whole situation, "Classic Gourd Babies rescuing their grandpa."
 

 
In this 1v4, aside from her precise and swift takedown of the initial ambusher, Tong Zhao didn’t display any particularly impressive gunplay.
 

 
In higher-level games, good aim is expected. What really makes the difference is tactical movement, positioning, use of throwables, and strategy. The skill level of her opponents in this match was relatively low, and Tong Zhao had perfectly predicted their moves, securing each kill with ease.
 

 
Everything happened in the blink of an eye.
 

 
"See, as long as you stay calm, a 1v4 is no big deal," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Her three teammates couldn’t see her impressive moves. All they noticed was her health bar dropping significantly. Player 2 started grumbling, "As expected, another one who won’t make it out of the airport. Doesn’t have the skills but still won’t follow commands..."
 

 
But then, three knockdown notifications popped up.
 

 
The same player who didn’t follow orders and supposedly lacked skill had just wiped out an entire squad.
 

 
Player 3 responded, "Uh, what?"
 

 
"Uh... got lucky, huh? Didn’t see that coming," Player 2 awkwardly laughed, quickly shifting the topic, "Alright, let’s keep looting!"
 

 
The live chat exploded with laughter at this turn of events, with viewers mocking the players for failing to recognize a pro in their midst.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was calmly healing in a safe spot. Her backpack, aside from essential ammo, was filled with medical supplies and throwables. "I’ve gathered enough resources. Let’s go check on what our little friends are up to," she said.
 

 
The chat immediately switched from laughing to begging for attention, with many fans saying they wished Tong Zhao would call them "little friends."
 

 
For once, Tong Zhao indulged them, smiling as she said, "Alright, you’re all my little friends."
 

 
…
 

 
Compared to the cool and collected pro, her three teammates were much more down-to-earth.
 

 
Viewers listened as they cautiously looted, with Player 4 stuck debating, "Should I take the thumb grip or the vertical grip?" This indecision was too much for Player 2, the self-appointed leader, who sighed, "Whatever, I’ll go watch the bridge. Hurry up and decide!”
 

 
At the bridge...
 

 
Tong Zhao drove straight there.
 

 
Player 2 had likely been ambushed near the bridge. In the voice chat, he shouted, "There’s someone here! I couldn’t hold them off! I’m down, I’m behind cover… Ah," realizing that his teammates were still far away, he added in a dejected tone, "Never mind, I’m done for. I can see the enemy coming to finish me off. You guys won’t make it in time."
 

 
The enemy approaching to finish him off was already very close.
 

 
Ten steps away.
 

 
Five steps…
 

 
Just at the critical moment, a gunshot rang out, followed by the sound of a bullet hitting its target. Player 2 noticed he hadn’t lost any more health.
 

 
The one who got knocked down wasn’t him—it was the enemy who had come to finish him!
 

 
"Whoa, who shot him? Did another team show up?"
 

 
Player 2, who had narrowly escaped death, was overjoyed.
 

 
But then he realized that if another team had arrived, they’d likely be after him too.
 

 
Before he could finish speaking, the sound of a throwable landing next to him echoed in his ears.
 

 
It wasn’t a grenade.
 

 
With a ‘whoosh’, a cloud of smoke spread, like the light of an angel enveloping him.
 

 
It was a smoke grenade, meant to protect him and obscure the enemy’s vision!
 

 
Player 2 quickly opened the minimap and saw that the silent teammate wasn’t dead after all, and had actually come to save him!
 

 
Player 2 exclaimed, "A living saint has descended right next to me??"
 

 
Now that they had regrouped, it was time to open comms.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned on her team mic and, at the same time, switched on a voice changer. Her usual feminine voice became a soft, gentle male tone: "There are enemies at the bridge. I’ve already knocked one. You focus on reviving your teammate. I’ll handle the rest.”
 

 
As Players 3 and 4 rushed over to save him, Player 2 secretly asked his roommate in the dormitory, "Whoa, this guy is killing it so hard. He’s not using aimbot or anything, is he? What if he suddenly teleports to my face and asks me if I want to buy hacks? Or should we team up and ambush him? I want to be the one who takes down the hacker! I won’t give in for just a few points!”
 

 
Before his roommate could answer, Tong Zhao asked, “Aren’t you leaving yet? The poison is coming, and there are meds and bags on the ground. If you need more, just take them.”
 

 
Player 2’s eyes lit up as he activated his mic, “Oh, I’m coming right now!!!”
 

 
After healing himself, he jogged over to Tong Zhao and asked, “Big brother, you’re not selling hacks, are you?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao was speechless: “Have you ever seen a hacker share their meds, not kill you, and still let you play?”
 

 
“I haven’t, I haven’t! I was wrong, big brother.”
 

 
“It’s fine, let’s go.”
 

 
Player 2 thought about it; usually, he was the one calling the shots and leading the team. How could he be so easily summoned and directed by her? This feeling of being a follower…
 

 
It felt too good.
 

 
The three of them followed this boss around excitedly, killing anyone they encountered as they walked.
 

 
Mostly, Tong Zhao was the one killing; they were just there to move.
 

 
She was killing so quickly that her teammates hardly had a chance to show off their skills.
 

 
Player 2 was the highest-skilled among them, and after finally taking down a lone enemy, he shouted, “Look, look! I killed one trying to escape!”
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, the icon indicating that the boss had eliminated a squad appeared in the top right corner.
 

 
…Okay.
 

 
Players 3 and 4 were mainly providing heavy fire to pretend to be strong.
 

 
Player 3 asked, “Mr. Chen, did you hit him?”
 

 
Player 4: “I didn’t hit him.”
 

 
Player 3: “Me neither. What do we do if we can’t hit him?”
 

 
“Are you stupid? Just shoot the ground next to the tree; he won’t dare to show his head.”
 

 
“Oh, right, right!”
 

 
During their playful banter, as the frontline opened up, the enemy who didn’t dare to show himself was precisely taken out by Tong Zhao, who had flanked him.
 

 
With the boss leading the way, they pretended to aim in the final circle, having a blast and racking up points.
 

 
Another joyful day of earning points!
 

 
The audience, who had been watching the entire time, was completely won over by her.
 

 
If she had been playing solo, it wouldn’t have had the same effect.
 

 
The key was those three clueless teammates, which gave the viewers a strong sense of immersion, as if even they were teaming up with the boss to earn points.
 

 
Usually, Tong Zhao was somewhat reserved and didn’t have a very loud image.
 

 
She would say what needed to be said, not a chatterbox, but also not too talkative.
 

 
It might also be because there were too many talkative people around her, like Shi Qianqiu and Wei Zekai, who could carry a group chat on their own, which made her seem more efficient and concise. But fans noticed that Tong Zhao actually loved to talk and was quite interesting when she did.
 

 
The live chat was filled with a sea of gifts.
 

 
After the first episode of "One Life Survivor" ended, the variety show fans flooded into her livestream, creating a strong buzz. They soon discovered she was streaming a shooting game, which hit the excitement point for many male viewers—what could be more thrilling than playing a game with a goddess who was also highly skilled?
 

 
Female gamers felt proud as well. Who says women can only be cute and helpless?
 

 
Thinking about it this way, they genuinely started promoting her.
 

 
“Thank you all for the gifts and for becoming captains and admirals,”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t lack for popularity or gifts; she was just explaining it to herself: “In any case, my shooting skills and mindset are honed in games. I know most people can’t do it, so don’t try to learn from me. After all…”
 

 
She curved the corner of her lips, tinted with a sugary hue: “People’s physiques can’t be generalized.”
 

 
Wow.
 

 
This mixture of truth and humor made the audience find her even more enigmatic.
 

 
But a superstar needs a bit of mystery to be appealing. Following a star is about the chase; if you can grasp it and see through it, then it’s no longer a star. It’s just a meteor that fell to Earth, dragged into a lab by astronomers for study.
 

 
It’s only when it’s floating in space that it’s called a star.
 

 
Only those who are worthy of admiration and pursuit can be called celebrities.
 

 
[Alright, you’re right, sis, we’ll listen to you.]
 

 
[I’m afraid to get shot if I don’t listen/dog emoji]
 

 
[I believe it, but can Sister Zhao stream for a bit longer? I was recommended here by a friend halfway through and just caught the final circle. I want to see Sister Zhao play from the beginning!]
 

 
The chat was filled with pleas for Tong Zhao to keep streaming; one round just wasn’t enough.
 

 
To be fair, Tong Zhao made it to the end in this round, and the duration wasn’t short, but the audience still wanted more.
 

 
“Okay, let’s play another round.”
 

 
“By the way, I’m not just practicing my mindset in *PUBG*; I have other games I can stream as well.”
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her Steam account.
 

 
Wow, she had so many games that they were almost endless.
 

 
This was also thanks to Wei Zekai. It wasn't that Tong Zhao asked him to buy games for her, but rather that this heavily addicted, fleeting enthusiasm-driven teenager wanted to play every time a new game came out. Not wanting to be lonely, he wanted to invite his friends to join him, so anyone on his Steam friends list frequently received gifts.
 

 
After finishing another round of ‘PUBG’, Tong Zhao also streamed games like ‘Bridge Building’, ‘Landlord’, and ‘League of Legends’.
 

 
Fans went from being shocked and bombarding the chat with question marks to accepting reality, and finally to numbly spamming [66666]...
 

 
Ah, their goddess's versatility was just that simple and mundane, yet somehow dry.
 

 
After Tong Zhao ended her stream, bored onlookers began to comment on the stars within the industry who enjoyed playing games.
 

 
After counting, they found quite a few.
 

 
After all, with the rise of esports in recent years and its entry into the public eye, celebrities playing the same games as fans highlighted their down-to-earth quality. If they played well, they could attract fans, and if they were bad at the game but still addicted, it had its own charm.
 

 
[...Wait, are you all really accepting that Tong Zhao's shooting skills and mindset were honed in games?]
 

 
[But she’s just so strong!]
 

 
[We’ve already accepted this narrative.]
 

 
Some content creators were responsible for compiling the best plays from well-known streamers each week, and thus, one bizarre clip got mixed in:
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Airport Bloodbath: Locking Down a Team”
 

 
Not only was the highlight reel impressive, but she also coordinated perfectly with the three random players in her first match.
 

 
If they hadn’t been a last-minute match, one would think they were intentionally cast actors.
 

 
Afterward, when those three male college students found out that the incredibly strong player they had teamed up with that day was Tong Zhao, they were stunned for several days and immediately changed their dorm group name to “The Three Handsome Guys Who Played With Tong Zhao,” earning the envy of everyone in school.
 

 
The irony was that the girl the first male student was pursuing was a die-hard fan of Tong Zhao. She felt a strong sense of identification with him, even wishing she could become a boy just to be a fanboy. When she found out about this, her heart was filled with jealousy, and she said she never wanted to see him again, fearing she wouldn't be able to control her jealousy and might end up hitting him...
 

 
It was unfair!
 

 
This situation would have ended there. Tong Zhao couldn’t possibly stream games all the time, but then a scandal broke out involving the promotion of a training app in which she had invested alongside Zeshan. The app's originally planned spokesperson was embroiled in a violent scandal involving shoving his girlfriend while dating someone else.
 

 
Although it hadn't reached the point of being banned, it would definitely have an impact.
 

 
If the money was refunded, the promotion of the app could be delayed.
 

 
Tong Zhao directly posted in the WeChat group:
 

 
[Delay what? I’m the best spokesperson. Let him refund the money and get lost.]
# Chapter78
Under further questioning, Tong Zhao discovered that the problem was quite significant.
 

 
When she was filming "One Life Survivor," there were many messages she didn't have time to handle. Her friends knew she was busy with work and didn’t want to disturb her. The "Little Lamb Companion" project had matured well under Tong Zhao’s previous guidance, and Wei Zekai couldn’t find any flaws in it; the only issue was that they were stuck on the promotion aspect.
 

 
This had him so worried that he was nearly bald.
 

 
Tong Zhao had high hopes for "Little Lamb Companion." Not only had she gotten Zeshan to invest in it, but she had also purchased it outright.
 

 
If Tong Zhao believed in the project, he couldn’t mess it up!
 

 
However, Wei Zekai truly lacked experience in marketing, and the proposals from the people he hired didn’t seem good enough.
 

 
With his vast financial resources, he thought about renting a batch of bus stop advertising spaces and purchasing subway ad spots. But then he wondered, would that be effective? The target users for "Little Lamb Companion" were likely not busy office workers... At least during their commutes, they probably wouldn’t feel compelled to download the app or place an order upon seeing such advertisements.
 

 
So how could they promote it effectively?
 

 
Under Tong Zhao’s guidance, Wei Zekai had already begun to adopt the necessary business mindset.
 

 
That was to avoid wasting unnecessary money.
 

 
In the past, the young master Wei had been overly pampered, and what he did was not really investing; at most, it could be considered charity.
 

 
Now, he was being very meticulous with his spending.
 

 
After listening, Tong Zhao first praised him, saying, "Now you understand the importance of saving. Your thinking is correct; don’t buy subway ad spaces, they’re not suitable for 'Little Lamb Companion' at the moment."
 

 
"What should we do instead?"
 

 
Wei Zekai asked sincerely.
 

 
He had always held Tong Zhao’s words in high regard. It wasn’t about romantic feelings; he simply believed that Tong Zhao was stronger than him in business and investment—quite a bit stronger. If they were partners in making money, he should listen to someone more capable. As long as he handled the tasks she assigned him well, he would take credit for it!
 

 
This distinction was quite subtle.
 

 
A man who wants to pamper a woman and listens to her is different from one who finds her strong and excellent and therefore obeys her. The feelings that arise from these two scenarios are not the same.
 

 
Tong Zhao was more inclined to accept the latter.
 

 
Unfortunately, the timing of the question was off, as Wei Zekai recalled a series of “plop plop plop plop...” sounds.
 

 
“…”
 

 
He frowned, sensing that things weren’t simple: “Tong Zhao, what are you doing?”
 

 
Immediately, Wei Zekai heard the sound of water.
 

 
“I’m taking a bath. I got so absorbed in my thoughts that I forgot half my face was submerged in the water.”
 

 
Tong Zhao casually described a rather silly situation.
 

 
Her tone was so flat that Wei Zekai didn’t think much of it. He listened attentively to every proposal she mentioned, taking notes on his iPad as he listened.
 

 
It wasn't until Wei Zekai hung up the phone that he belatedly realized...
 

 
Huh? Tong Zhao was kind of cute just now.
 

 
Wait, she’s taking a bath. Does that mean she’s not wearing any clothes?
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai clasped his hands over his head, trying to stop imagining what was happening on the other end of the call by picturing himself as a stone.
 

 
Stop your shameful imagination!
 

 
...
 

 
The original promotional spokesperson for "Little Lamb Companion" was Peng Yuankang, who was currently in quite a mess.
 

 
His cheating scandal had been exposed, and after a heated argument with his girlfriend, he “accidentally” used too much force, which was captured on camera and turned into undeniable evidence of violent behavior. He lost a significant number of fans. Fortunately, the remaining fans weren't too bright and were particularly eager to support him... but after the numbers dwindled, many partnerships that had been going well fell apart, and some contracts were terminated.
 

 
Capitalists never act foolishly; the contract clearly stated that no major scandals could occur during the cooperation period, and the various clauses made his head spin.
 

 
Many businesses stated that while they wouldn't demand compensation, the funds definitely had to be returned.
 

 
With no energy or money to fight lawsuits, Peng Yuankang had no choice but to refund the money.
 

 
For some businesses that didn’t have time to find a replacement or had no one to replace him, Peng Yuankang knew they would stubbornly use him until the end.
 

 
"Little Lamb Companion" was one of those cases.
 

 
Unexpectedly, that morning, his manager received a call from the other party about terminating the contract and replacing him, and their attitude was quite firm. Last night, after partying until midnight, Peng Yuankang woke up with a hangover and was hugging the toilet to throw up when he heard this news, instantly looking even worse as he angrily said, “If I’m replaced, who else can they find?”
 

 
The promotional budget for this app wasn't high, and they wanted to find a star who could portray a gaming persona.
 

 
He happened to fit both criteria perfectly.
 

 
If it weren’t for the major scandal, he would have been a cost-effective choice for promotion.
 

 
Feeling like "I'm finished, but I can't stand to see you do well," he was like a loser obsessively stalking his ex's Weibo, fixating on the official account of "Little Lamb Companion."
 

 
In the end, there was only a single post announcing the termination of their collaboration with Peng Yuankang.
 

 
The comments below were filled with disappointed fans and satisfied passersby.
 

 
What about the new spokesperson?
 

 
Are they not looking for one?
 

 
It's possible, but how are they planning to promote it?
 

 
Peng Yuankang’s educational background wasn’t great; he was focused on how to gain and retain fans, and how to become popular. After graduating from high school, all he wanted was to become a star. He thought about how easy it would be to gain fans and make money. He only knew that if he became popular, he could sell a single Weibo post for six figures and earn significant promotional fees just by taking a few smiling promotional photos. Money seemed to come as simply as he imagined.
 

 
Fans were only lovable when they were spending money.
 

 
Without those fans willing to download the app repeatedly and provide attractive data for the business, how could this app be promoted? He thought about it for a long time but couldn't come up with a solution. Eventually, he decided to just lie in bed after throwing up and happily scroll through Douyin on his phone.
 

 
As he scrolled, he came across a gameplay video for "Honor of Kings."
 

 
In one game, a female player who enjoyed playing mid-lane was getting "greened.”
 

 
She originally had a jungler partner, but her jungler was lured away by a soft and charming voice belonging to a girl named Yao, who happened to be matched up against the female protagonist. The scumbag, along with his new fling, bullied her, and the new girl mocked her in everyone’s channel, saying she had no one to support her.
 

 
At this moment, the jungler on the female protagonist's side responded: [She has me to support her.]
 

 
Not only was there a voiceover, but it was accompanied by a classic black-and-white, melancholic, and darkened male avatar.
 

 
The voice was so clear that it couldn't have been in-game voice chat.
 

 
It had to have been added in post-production.
 

 
Of course, the result was that the female protagonist, with the help of this super strong random jungler, turned the tables and made a comeback. The female protagonist was very grateful, and the random jungler, using his sexy and husky male god voice, replied casually, “No need to thank me, I’m just playing solo.” Then, he exited the game room. When the female protagonist checked, she discovered he was a newcomer in "Little Lamb Companion" (highlighted in bold and red) and loudly exclaimed, “So downloading this Little Lamb Companion app allows you to find powerful players?” With a curious mindset, she decided to place an order for him…
 

 
“Ah?” Peng Yuankang looked completely bewildered.
 

 
In "Honor of Kings," unless you're in a high-ranked tier or playing at odd hours like late night or early morning, the chances of matching the same players or people you know in lower-ranked matches or fish ponds are very low. (Of course, it’s very low, not impossible.)
 

 
This was clearly staged!
 

 
Can gameplay be staged?
 

 
The key was that the comment section was so unable to distinguish reality from fiction, totally captivated, and enthusiastically discussing this melodramatic plot, complete with download links.
 

 
There were also gender-swapped versions.
 

 
The lonely male players who had gone through breakups encountered the gentle and soft-voiced companions in "Little Lamb Companion," where they both leveled up and healed from their pain.
 

 
The skilled jungler who couldn’t find a girl to play with tried taking orders in "Little Lamb Companion" and ended up making money while finding love.
 

 
After receiving the promotional refund from Peng Yuankang, Tong Zhao divided it into several parts and decided to collaborate with game streamers who charged relatively lower fees, spreading out the investment. She allowed these streamers to have their names featured in "Little Lamb Companion" and, if they were willing, they could actually sign contracts and take orders there, receiving a more favorable revenue share...
 

 
The big streamers would only be listed as names, but many mid-tier and small streamers genuinely wanted to take orders here.
 

 
One sheep is one dollar, and 200 sheep for one game session.
 

 
It’s not cheap, but there will definitely be fans willing to pay.
 

 
For ordinary companionship, the cost generally starts from 10 sheep for one game session, and the price can be increased as their level goes up with more orders.
 

 
Any game can have companions.
 

 
There are also those who read stories, sing to lull people to sleep... Of course, Tong Zhao had the foresight to strictly prohibit inappropriate services, requiring that profile images and backgrounds undergo review to ensure they aren't vulgar or overly revealing.
 

 
This promotional effect was much better than hiring a spokesperson.
 

 
Tong Zhao also pointed out a clear path for Wei Zekai: "There must be people in your friend circle who know about e-sports clubs. When looking for a spokesperson, you should reach out to them. Gamers don’t recognize entertainment industry stars; they only recognize the gaming circle."
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, "So we won't look for spokespeople in the entertainment industry?"
 

 
Tong Zhao sent him some of her best promotional photos, telling him to find someone to edit them, and once that was done, she would inform her agent to finalize the matter.
 

 
The blue ocean market of companionship and training was thoroughly occupied by Zeshan under her forward-thinking decisions.
 

 
The first person to take the plunge gets to seize all the advantages.
 

 
First, they captured the target customer group with streamers and game videos. As long as a large number of curious players came to join, some to consume and others to earn money, the "Little Lamb Companion" platform became "alive." Finally, Tong Zhao stepped in as a spokesperson, allowing the general public to discover this formal and convenient software, elevating its status.
 

 
Everyone in the industry couldn't help but marvel at how difficult it is to make a platform-based software popular; throwing money at ad placements and splash screens is like pouring money into a bottomless pit.
 

 
Who would have thought that directing and acting out some melodramatic gaming stories could spread virally?
 

 
There must be experts behind this!
 

 
But who are these experts?
 

 
It’s easy to trace the ownership of a software company, and it quickly led to the venture capital firm Zeshan behind it. No one doing business in the city was unaware that this group of playful second-generation wealthy individuals had a wise mentor behind them. It seemed that this was also the handiwork of that wise mentor. Many wealthy individuals secretly inquired with the Wei family, wondering if they could invite this behind-the-scenes expert at a high price for some guidance.
 

 
The Wei family, knowing the truth, thought: …
 

 
If he said this expert was a twenty-something female star, would these people believe it?
 

 
Mr. Wei was vague and could only say that this expert had a deep connection with his little Kai, describing them as a person of great skill whom he had known since childhood. Their reputation was high enough that it wasn’t convenient to reveal their identity.
 

 
Two days later, a message circulated in the city's elite circles.
 

 
The wise expert behind Zeshan was none other than Wei Zekai's godfather.
 

 
...
 

 
Unbeknownst to her, Tong Zhao's other identity was rising in value.
 

 
And as for her, after knowing that this promotional strategy was feasible and that the software’s marketing was on the right track, she continued to be the hands-off manager.
 

 
After all, there were more important matters at hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao went for the audition for "The Knives of the Maiden." The audition location was not in her city.
 

 
However, in the holographic era, Director Shi speculated that since she was busy with her rising fame, he didn’t insist that she come to Qin City; they could connect via a holographic filming chamber in the film studio to access the cloud data.
 

 
Tong Zhao's impression of Director Shi improved even further.
 

 
The script for "The Knives of the Maiden" was not complicated, and she watched it alongside other characters.
 

 
The main character, Xie Guiya, had a name that resembled those in martial arts novels, but she had no interest in chivalry or heroics. Her biggest wish was to get accepted into a good university and find an ordinary job after graduation...
 

 
Although she couldn't imagine herself getting married and having children, she firmly believed her life would be on the right track.
 

 
She longed for an ordinary life too much!
 

 
At university, Xie Guiya, who maintained a sense of distance from everyone, fell in love with the campus heartthrob. While they were dating at a milk tea shop during the day, they heard about a bizarre theft of a cultural relic from China. Beside the empty safe was a brand-new knife, and the stolen antiquity was exactly a knife. This was already the third cultural relic theft this season, and each time a weapon was lost, the same type of weapon would appear in the location, only it was brand new.
 

 
The reasons for the theft were various, and the campus heartthrob sighed that it really felt like something out of a martial arts film—how enchanting!
 

 
Xie Guiya asked him, "Do you really like martial arts movies?”
 

 
The campus heartthrob immediately became energized and enthusiastically recommended his favorite martial arts novels to her—turns out he was a martial arts fan. He had read all the high-quality and well-known novels, movies, and comics. He was also well-versed in various urban legends, including the one about a martial arts family with a history of over a hundred years that was said to be living as hermits in this city...
 

 
“By the way, your name has a very martial arts vibe too. Others say your name sounds masculine, but I particularly like it.” The campus heartthrob looked at her with affection, feeling he was quite good at sweet-talking!
 

 
However, the female lead's mentality broke at that moment.
 

 
Because Xie Guiya actually came from a martial arts family.
 

 
The “hundred-year-old martial arts family” that the campus heartthrob mentioned… was her family. Since childhood, her father had insisted that she practice martial arts. Why? Because her father grew up during the era that promoted the idea that women could hold up half the sky. He was very patriotic and listened to the leaders, believing in gender equality, insisting that both men and women should practice martial arts for self-defense! Xie Guiya was an extraordinary martial arts talent, effortlessly training even better than her brother while maintaining an expressionless demeanor and complaining lightly.
 

 
But Xie Guiya only wanted to be an ordinary person; she didn’t want to become the modern martial arts leader.
 

 
The main storyline revolves around the theft of cultural relics, which leads to the upcoming 108th martial arts conference about to take place in the city.
 

 
The subplot involves the female lead resolving this seemingly ridiculous modern martial arts incident while learning that Huaxia martial arts are a cultural inheritance, reconciling her inner conflicts, and reaching personal growth.
 

 
So who should go?
 

 
Director Shi was attracted by Duan Ge from "One Life Survivor," so it seemed natural for him to choose Duan Ge for this role.
 

 
Duan Ge: “I just killed twenty people in the movie, and I've been feeling particularly murderous lately. I might just kill all the competitors for the leadership position before going back to studying.”
 

 
...That makes sense.
 

 
"How about I go?" the female reporter suggested.
 

 
Journalism is a clerical profession, but not all journalists are the same.
 

 
Her first anti-war news was that of a war correspondent.
 

 
However, her personality is much more peaceful than Duan Ge’s; she even possesses a softness and kindness that sometimes border on excessive compassion, which often leads her to depression as she searches for the truth behind others' suffering.
 

 
Tong Zhao pondered for a moment and decided to consult Director Shi—
 

 
Her subconscious inclination is toward diversity; everyone knows this. She couldn’t decide which side of herself to bring to the character of Xie Guiya. If possible, could she audition twice, allowing Director Shi to choose which side to use?
 

 
Shi Dingjun was surprised.
 

 
The production costs for a film can be high, but if only one segment is filmed for the audition, the price is not so exorbitant.
 

 
The director agreed, allowing her to portray the same segment with different mindsets to see how it would turn out.
# Chapter79
Qin City.
 

 
Inside a diamond-grade audition room.
 

 
"Director Shi, did you really agree to such an absurd request?"
 

 
The supervisor of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wore a look of disapproval.
 

 
He knew the director admired Tong Zhao, had seen her movies and variety shows, and thought she had great potential to play Xie Guiya, but the idea that someone could possess multiple subconscious personas? That sounded too far-fetched to him.
 

 
The supervisor had seen actors, enraged by finding out their girlfriends cheated on them just before an audition, suddenly transform from their usual mild-mannered selves into volatile, aggressive characters once they got into the role.
 

 
He had also seen actors who, desperate for a final chance at an audition, broke through their own limitations of timidity and delivered excellent performances.
 

 
But those situations were different from what Tong Zhao was describing.
 

 
"Multiple subconscious personas in one person? I think she’s just buying into the hype about her ‘most special subconscious’ persona," the supervisor shook his head, disappointed. He had a good impression of Tong Zhao before, but her recent behavior was ruining that. He added a logical inference, "Maybe she just really wants the role and is afraid she won’t perform well in a single audition, so she’s scheming to get two chances. If she were honest about it, I wouldn’t be so irritated."
 

 
Director Shi smiled good-naturedly.
 

 
"You’re only doing this because of the old curator, right?" the supervisor asked.
 

 
"Movies and actors are a two-way choice. Tong Zhao is currently valued highly in commercial films," Director Shi, though having high standards for movies, spoke smoothly, never really saying much while remaining respectful to everyone. "I’d like to see the results of the audition first before making any judgments. At the very least, her action scenes should be quite impressive."
 

 
"That’s true. This is a new experiment for you, after all. The lead must have strong personal charisma, and she can definitely pull that off." Reluctantly, the supervisor acknowledged her strengths.
 

 
Tong Zhao was well-liked by the audience.
 

 
This couldn’t be explained by just her appearance. Perhaps it was because she had experienced many different lives, continuously offering something new to the audience while allowing them to always find something they liked in her. And when she occasionally revealed her true self, the audience couldn’t quite figure out who she really was, adding a mysterious allure to her stardom.
 

 
That was the industry’s analysis, trying to uncover her "secret to overnight success."
 

 
But so far, no one had been able to replicate it.
 

 
The supervisor glanced at the clock.
 

 
In Director Shi Dingjun’s special audition room, there was an unusually designed clock with hands shaped like swords of varying lengths, giving off an intense and intimidating vibe. "Are the supporting actors ready?"
 

 
"They’re already in the filming pod."
 

 
"Good."
 

 
"What about Tong Zhao?"
 

 
……
 

 
[Who’s going first?]
 

 
When Tong Zhao entered the private audition room, she asked the other personas for their opinions.
 

 
Duan Ge responded, [Shall I go?]
 

 
Tong Zhao readily agreed, giving up her role as the primary persona.
 

 
Due to budget considerations, the lead and supporting actors would audition together. Supporting actors wouldn’t be given a second chance, so even though Duan Ge and the female reporter (Shen Shuyi) were performing the same scene, the supporting actors would be different.
 

 
Aside from the male lead and the villain, the other two supporting actors were in their third round of auditions.
 

 
Accompanied by the faint hum of the air conditioner, Duan Ge fell into a deep sleep.
 

 
……
 

 
The purpose of the audition was to test whether the actor’s subconscious matched the character.
 

 
The clearest way to see this was in the character's choices and reactions.
 

 
Scene: The top floor of a luxurious clubhouse in Jiang City.
 

 
Characters:
 
- Xie Guiya (protagonist)
 
- Cheng Siwen (important male supporting role)
 
- Plum Blossom Swordsman (supporting role)
 
- Horse Boxer (supporting role)
 
- Fu Xuancheng (important supporting role)
 

 
Combat rankings in this scenario: Fu Xuancheng > Plum Blossom Swordsman = Xie Guiya > Horse Boxer >>>>> Cheng Siwen
 

 
Plot: Xie Guiya, attending the martial arts tournament in place of her father, who injured his back during a midlife crisis and couldn’t lift his sword, needs to make a strong entrance to impress the martial arts elites. At the same time, she has to bring her boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, who has no fighting skills, to identify a notorious thief.
 

 
The challenge is to assert dominance over the other supporting characters while protecting her boyfriend.
 

 
In the script, the writer set up the "protection" as the female lead using various methods to prevent the others from harming him.
 

 
She could rely on intelligence or intimidation through martial prowess.
 

 
The main goal was to see if the actor's subconscious could create chemistry with the character.
 

 
Fight scenes could be compensated with choreography, a common approach in action films. Backed by the old curator, Director Shi Dingjun had access to the best action designers.
 

 
The supervisor recalled the two previous actors who had already gone home to wait for results.
 

 
The first, Qin Yisi, was tall. She wore a mask and disguised herself as a man. Before her debut in films, she had been involved in online voice acting and could naturally produce a deep male voice without the need for a voice modulator, making Cheng Siwen pass as her brother.
 

 
Director Shi gave her a passing grade but felt she lacked confidence.
 

 
Why did she have to disguise herself as a man?
 

 
The ability to imitate a male voice was a nice touch, but Director Shi wanted to portray a modern female hero this time, so he sent her home to wait for further news.
 

 
The second, Zhang He, had Cheng Siwen pretend to be a waiter, entering separately from her, while she secretly told her friends to call the police if they didn’t hear from her for a certain period. This approach was too pragmatic and clearly reflected her personality.
 

 
This wasn’t the Xie Guiya Director Shi wanted.
 

 
In his audition notes, he wrote: [Reflects Xie Guiya's self-perception but lacks uniqueness. Unable to capture the real essence of her character. Her actions are reasonable and steady, but the connection to the character is weak.]
 

 
In the female lead’s eyes, she was practical and had no relation to being a hero.
 

 
But in reality, she grew up immersed in a martial arts family and had a heroic spirit.
 

 
The entire film was about her journey from repressing that spirit to finally accepting it.
 

 
The supervisor mumbled quietly, "Actually, I thought Qin Yisi did a pretty good job."
 

 
"Her choice to disguise herself as a man for the sake of courage was a major negative for me. While this might have been understandable in a patriarchal era, it’s unnecessary in a modern setting."
 

 
Director Shi shook his head. "I want to convey the essence of traditional martial arts through this film. There’s no need to perpetuate outdated values."
 

 
The monitor lit up.
 

 
This meant Tong Zhao had entered the world of the holographic film.
 

 
……
 

 
Outside the luxury clubhouse in Jiang City.
 

 
"Baby, should I follow you inside?"
 

 
The protagonist’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, the film’s male supporting character, asked.
 

 
The model created by Duan Ge’s subconscious was dressed in an ordinary outfit, not disguised in a mask and men’s clothing like Qin Yisi's version, nor wearing any eccentric clothes. She wasn’t even in pants suitable for fighting but in a knee-length cocktail dress.
 

 
The modeler pulled up data showing that this cocktail dress could be easily removed by unfastening a side button, revealing black shorts underneath.
 

 
The difference between the audition and the official shoot was that in the audition, the actors chose their outfits based on their subconscious desires rather than pre-designed costumes. The AI would select something that aligned with the actor’s imagination from the modeling database, ensuring the props met the audition’s needs.
 

 
This explained the previous actor’s mask and men’s attire.
 

 
"Why wear a dress?" the modeler asked, puzzled.
 

 
"Because wearing jeans to such an event would look strange," the supervisor, having watched countless films, immediately understood the logic. He saw the overlap between Duan Ge’s thinking and the character’s: "Attending a martial arts gathering, which is a super-realist setting, while maintaining a grounded and practical mindset—this performance is very in tune with the protagonist!"
 

 
Once the audition began, the supervisor quickly put aside his previous biases against her.
 

 
Sure enough, all the men and women entering the clubhouse were dressed in formal attire.
 

 
Duan Ge’s simple dress was already quite understated.
 

 
The supervisor commented, "The outfits worn by the previous two actors attracted attention from passersby, which actually goes against the protagonist’s principle of keeping a low profile in front of ‘ordinary people.’"
 

 
They continued watching.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded and instructed, "Don’t call me baby in there. Call me sis."
 

 
She briefly explained that her boyfriend should act like her little brother or lackey. "Whatever you think—subordinate, follower, or gofer. If I scold or hit you, just bear with it. Don’t talk, do less, and use your eyes to observe."
 

 
"Are you going to hit me?" Cheng Siwen looked dumbfounded.
 

 
He hadn’t expected his girlfriend to be so fierce, but behind his dazed look was a trace of excitement.
 

 
It wasn’t that he had a masochistic streak, but the character setting made him fascinated by anything related to martial arts, sparking positive emotions in him. (All character traits were controlled by manipulating brain chemicals to trigger preferences).
 

 
Duan Ge nodded slightly and whispered a few more instructions in his ear.
 

 
The actor playing Cheng Siwen had a more submissive subconscious, and with Duan Ge’s authoritative tone, he nodded obediently
 

 
The director and Mr. Shi were curious about what she said, feeling quite intrigued.
 

 
Unconsciously, they had already been somewhat drawn into the scene, like watching a movie and not wanting to immediately uncover the mystery.
 

 
After taking the elevator to the top floor, they were greeted by a vast rooftop and an infinity pool.
 

 
Three supporting actors were already waiting there for the two of them.
 

 
"You are the successor of Xie Shengyi?"
 

 
The martial artist asked, looking at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
This was a default assumption, that the person who could attend in place of their father had to be a man.
 

 
Previously, Qin Yisi had caught the attention of the supporting characters by wearing an eye-catching mask and men's clothing, preventing any cases of mistaken identity.
 

 
Cheng Siwen kept in mind what his girlfriend had told him—don’t speak, do less—and kept his head down, observing in secret.
 

 
"I'm talking to you."
 

 
The martial artist strode forward.
 

 
Each step exuded the aura of a mere cannon fodder.
 

 
"What will Tong Zhao do next?" the director wondered.
 

 
As soon as he spoke, in the filming scene, Duan Ge moved faster than the martial artist. Using two moves of Bajiquan, she struck his vital points, leaving him stunned. She then grabbed the fabric of his back, pulling him down, while raising her knee to strike his chest. The front and back of a person’s chest are places that cannot withstand heavy blows easily. The martial artist, whose strength was set lower than the protagonist at this point, had no ability to fight back.
 

 
Duan Ge’s subconscious had been infused with a lot of martial arts knowledge, all of which the protagonist had learned from a young age.
 

 
She chose the most brutal and ruthless close-combat style of Bajiquan.
 

 
"Ouch."
 

 
The director felt the pain just watching it.
 

 
"Tong Zhao really hits hard. If she’s not careful, she could kill someone. She’s basically going for the kill," Mr. Shi, being an expert, saw it even more clearly. Initially surprised, he then recalled that she was a ruthless character who had eliminated 20 people on a reality survival show. That made it all seem reasonable. "Her subconscious temper is really explosive."
 

 
The martial artist saw stars and could barely stand.
 

 
The other supporting actor and villain had no intention of helping him.
 

 
He opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, he got beaten up again.
 

 
The AI scanned Cheng Siwen's character, who had a loud inner monologue: "Yes, it's now! She's going to ask me to speak up and stop her!"
 

 
"Sis, if you keep hitting him, you're going to kill him..."
 

 
"Hmm?"
 

 
Duan Ge grabbed the martial artist, who had passed out, by the back of the neck like he was trash and looked back at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
In the camera shot, her eyes were indifferent and deep, with the reflections from the infinity pool lights in her pupils, shimmering like the glint of madness.
 

 
She let go, and the man collapsed to the ground.
 

 
Facing Cheng Siwen and the camera, from the perspective of the other two characters, she lifted a wicked smile and softly said, "Are you teaching me how to do things?"
 

 
From the view of the two supporting actors, she was even attacking her own people.
 

 
There was no need to explain. Her actions and presence had already conveyed that she was the sole heir of the Xie family.
 

 
Pure madness!
 

 
This unpredictable hidden strength, combined with her ruthlessness, made the other two wary of her.
 

 
The director finally pulled up the protagonist's inner monologue for this scene.
 

 
Duan Ge wasn't actually insane.
 

 
She simply knew that in this banquet, she was the primary target. One against three was a fight she couldn't win. So, she chose to single out one person and beat them up to establish dominance. But how to ensure no one would touch Cheng Siwen? Her reasoning was that no one would be interested in a minor character. By making him act timid and allowing him to be scolded in front of everyone, she figured they’d see him as insignificant and useless and would simply ignore him.
 

 
At the same time, he also served as a tool to display her imposing aura.
 

 
She pretended to hit him a few times, but it was all for show—lots of noise but little harm.
 

 
Cheng Siwen recognized the infamous thief Fu Xuancheng. After testing the waters, he quietly and pitifully asked her, "Weren't you supposed to not really hit me?"
 

 
Duan Ge:
 

 
"Anyone I really hit is already waiting to get into the ICU. You'll just cry for two days and be sore for a week, and then you'll be fine."
 

 
Pulled into her twisted logic, Cheng Siwen whispered his thanks.
 

 
The audition ended with a shot of him looking slightly confused, wondering if he had been tricked.
 

 
The director laughed out loud. "Tong Zhao is funny, but she seems a bit too fierce."
 

 
"I want to see that other side of her that Tong Zhao mentioned."
 

 
Mr. Shi noted this on her audition feedback: "Highly skilled at utilizing the martial arts knowledge infused into her subconscious, adept at using the people and objects around her to highlight her character and achieve plot objectives. Has a certain comedic sense, but is a bit too fierce. If we decide to use her, the script might need slight adjustments."
 

 
After watching Tong Zhao's audition, Mr. Shi felt a strong urge to choose her.
 

 
But "The Knives of the Maiden" might not be quite the right fit for her.
 

 
Unless the script was rewritten...
 

 
The screenwriter, who had already been asked by the client to rewrite the story about ten times before the audition even started, sighed:
 

 
"Director, why are you looking at me?”
# Chapter80
"Do you need some time to prepare?"
 

 
Director Shi asked with concern over the phone.
 

 
From his perspective, switching between two entirely different emotional states must be quite mentally taxing. Audition time is precious, and typically, actors wait anxiously for their turn. However, after the first audition, he was willing to wait for Tong Zhao to be ready, as he just wanted to see her in her best state.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Shuyi, are you ready?]
 
[I'm fine.]
 
[If I can help you out this time, that would be great.]
 

 
Shuyi smiled.
 

 
Ever since returning to her original world and stepping back into the entertainment industry, Tong Zhao had been living a relaxed and healthy life, far from negative emotions. This cheerful mental state nourished the journalist—no, Shen Shuyi—allowing her to rediscover her own name.
 

 
All of this, she thought, was the system's fault.
 

 
Back then, the system gave Shuyi a task to hand in three news articles, all on dark and brutal subjects.
 

 
But Shuyi was the kindest among them, the one who most wanted to pursue justice.
 

 
The public needed the truth, and the higher-ups needed to be held accountable by the people.
 

 
If a portion of the population could be saved, if younger generations could be warned, and if the voices of the vulnerable could be heard, she would be willing to risk everything, even if it meant crashing and burning.
 

 
Thinking of this, Tong Zhao realized that she, too, had a sense of chivalry.
 

 
Tong Zhao thanked the director for his consideration. "No need, let's go straight into it."
 

 
"Alright, I'll restart the program on my end."
 

 
Without removing the equipment, Tong Zhao once again drifted into a dream.
 

 
...
 

 
The familiar time and place.
 

 
The luxurious club in Jiang City, outside the Hero Mansion.
 

 
"Darling, should I follow you inside later?"
 

 
Cheng Siwen asked.
 

 
All the backstage staff had their eyes on the main character, not sparing even a glance at him.
 

 
Now, facing the same lines and the same situation, what kind of different reactions and choices would Tong Zhao make?
 

 
Everyone was shocked to discover—
 

 
Tong Zhao's subconscious had conjured a different outfit!
 

 
She was dressed in a Burberry trench coat, underneath a simple white shirt—no extra embroidery or logo, just a plain white shirt. Paired with short black dress pants, her long, slender legs were strikingly eye-catching.
 

 
There's no denying it—her height and exceptional body proportions suited this style perfectly.
 

 
...
 

 
"Wha-wha-what... how did she manage to achieve such a huge psychological shift in such a short time?!"
 

 
The head of the modeling team exclaimed in disbelief.
 

 
The more professional someone is, the more they can appreciate the marvel that is Tong Zhao, beyond just her outfit change.
 

 
Normal subconscious activity tends to solidify in the short term and flow in the long term.
 

 
In simpler terms, the moon may become full, and people may change, but the moon doesn’t go from crescent to full in just a few minutes. It’s like certain flashy, unreliable weight-loss drugs that promise you can lose 30 pounds in three days without exercising—the only possible way to achieve that is through amputation.
 

 
This was already beyond his comprehension.
 

 
Director Shi frowned and said, "Quiet. Let’s discuss it after we’ve finished watching."
 

 
He didn’t care if it made sense. He was only interested in what kind of effect Tong Zhao would show him in her second audition.
 

 
The assistant director nodded.
 

 
Even without knowing the full truth, he could sense the subtle changes between the two personalities: "This time, the outfit imagined by Tong Zhao’s subconscious seems to have a higher sense of quality."
 

 
After all, Duan Ge (Tong Zhao's character) was one of Tong Zhao’s personalities that lived a more austere life.
 

 
It was hard enough for her to get a decent meal, let alone worry about picking out clothes. She could accept the concept of wearing clothes that suited the occasion, but she wouldn’t think much about the brand or style—comfort and functionality were more important. However, Shuyi, after helping to broker a ceasefire between two nations and returning to the bustling city to receive recognition, was outwardly adorned in high-end fashion, reflecting the admiration and joy of those around her, even though she felt no inner emotion.
 

 
"Does Tong Zhao have bad eyesight? This is the first time I’ve seen her wearing glasses," an assistant wondered.
 

 
Not only was she wearing glasses, but they were heavy, thick-framed, black-rimmed glasses.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s small face made the glasses look less awkward, lending her a scholarly air while emphasizing her petite features. The large frames seemed to take up nearly a third of her face, accentuating her fair complexion.
 

 
The assistant director was unconcerned. "Maybe it’s just a fashionable accessory with no prescription."
 

 
"Is that even fashionable?" another staff member asked, confused.
 

 
"She looks good in them, though."
 

 
The assistant director saw no issue, so no one else dared to point out that the glasses really weren’t fashionable. It was only because she had a good figure that they looked good on her...
 

 
A script modeling technician checked the database to see if the glasses had a prescription.
 

 
It was possible she had been wearing contact lenses before.
 

 
Such small data points wouldn’t impact the overall plot.
 

 
But when the technician saw the glasses’ data in the system, they gasped.
 

 
In the audition scene:
 

 
"This time, I’m not well-prepared, but it’ll have to do," Shuyi glanced at her naive boyfriend and shook her head. "No, you don’t need to follow me. I used last week’s tutoring wages to buy these smart glasses with a recording function. After I come out, just cross-check the faces I record."
 

 
Assistant Director & Director & Scriptwriter & Staff: "..."
 

 
Wait, is this what you call ‘not well-prepared’!?
 

 
Tong Zhao did indeed have a budget of under 20,000 yuan, as her character was designed to be a frugal and outstanding university student who worked part-time as a tutor. Because she attended a prestigious university, her hourly wage was quite high. Most of her money was methodically saved for the future, as her character hoped to own a house by the age of 30.
 

 
At this moment, the technician who had just checked the database chimed in, "Those smart Bluetooth glasses have an HD camera. If you blink four times, it records a shot. Plus, they use bone-conduction headphones, allowing discreet real-time communication with Cheng Siwen.”
 

 
The staff members were speechless.
 

 
Smart glasses, well, they aren't exactly new.
 

 
When they first came out, they were overhyped, and when people saw how bulky and unattractive they were, combined with the fact that the functionality was far from the hacker-age technology they imagined, they lost interest immediately. Except for a few tech enthusiasts, most people didn’t pay much attention to them, and few realized that they had since become lighter, more stylish, and affordable.
 

 
The database had plenty of models to choose from, but the catch was whether the actor could imagine using them. The first two actors didn’t even think of such a method. They only thought about how inconvenient it would be to secretly take photos with a phone, which is why they figured they had to bring the weakling Cheng Siwen along.
 

 
Even Duan Ge hadn’t thought of it.
 

 
Director Shi pondered, “But this idea doesn’t disrupt the tone of the movie. It’s very much something Xie Guiya would do.”
 

 
It’s a clash between modern technology and traditional martial arts, and the protagonist is a modern-day female warrior.
 

 
"Other than having the same face, this performance is completely different from her last audition. I don’t think the Tong Zhao from the previous scene would use smart glasses unless someone gave them to her as a prop," the assistant director analyzed.
 

 
Subconscious creativity varies in strength, and it can be field-specific. For example, someone who has been a civil servant in real life, or whose family has been involved in government, might have a keen sense of navigating social interactions. When their subconscious enters a film setting, they might creatively tweak scenes involving interpersonal conflict, which could lead to script changes.
 

 
If these tweaks don’t derail the plot, they can actually be positive, reflecting the actor’s subconscious creativity.
 

 
In the world of traditional filmmaking, this would be called “improvisation.”
 

 
"I’ll be worried if you go in alone," Cheng Siwen said. Though he was gentle and obedient to his girlfriend, in the script, he played a righteous character. In reality, he was a young, sunny, and handsome actor. Hearing that his girlfriend planned to face danger alone made him feel uneasy.
 

 
But objectively speaking, it was indeed better if he didn’t go in.
 

 
So how would Tong Zhao resolve this?
 

 
Shuyi glanced at her watch and said, "I'll give you one minute. Come up with a way to help me without causing trouble."
 

 
Cheng Siwen couldn’t think of anything.
 

 
She smiled and logged into a cloud account on his phone. "The photos I take will be uploaded to the cloud," she said, blinking four times. As expected, within ten seconds, a close-up photo of Cheng Siwen’s face appeared in the cloud photo album. “If I encounter any danger I can’t handle, I’ll snap a bunch of meaningless floor photos. Then you…”
 

 
“Call the police?”
 

 
“No, you’ll take the pictures of their faces that I uploaded and forward them to your QQ account.”
 

 
Shuyi spoke with calm, serene eyes set in her strikingly beautiful face.
 

 
She continued, “Think about it. Who am I?”
 

 
“The heir to the Xie family!”
 

 
Cheng Siwen instantly answered, his face lighting up with excitement, like a fanboy seeing his favorite superhero.
 

 
“…I’m a university student from Qin who doesn’t want anyone to know I’m moonlighting as a vigilante.”
 

 
Shuyi said, “In modern society, there are no hidden warriors. Even the leader of a martial arts alliance has to work a regular job. They inevitably have an open identity. I don’t need you to call the police. I just need them to know that I have pictures of their faces. I don’t believe all three of them would be indifferent to having their identities exposed.”
 

 
“As long as one of them cares, the other two will stop him from doing anything reckless.”
 

 
Her explanation woke her boyfriend up.
 

 
Putting himself in their shoes, Cheng Siwen realized that the other side would be afraid too. This was Shuyi’s way of handling things.
 

 
Convinced, Cheng Siwen no longer insisted on going in with her.
 

 
As soon as Shuyi entered, she used her smart glasses to take a group photo of the three men.
 

 
When the Ma boxer provoked her, Shuyi quickly subdued him as well. However, unlike Duan Ge, she wasn’t as ruthless. She stopped just before hitting a vital point. “Can’t we resolve this peacefully? By now, it’s clear I’m the heir to the Xie family, right?” The Ma boxer pretended to apologize and beg for mercy, hoping to catch her off guard and strike back. But Shuyi, already prepared, kicked him in the knee, forcing him to kneel!
 

 
She stepped on his thigh, blinked four more times, and said in an incredibly polite, gentle voice, "It seems you only listen when you're on your knees."
 

 
As a journalist, Shuyi was used to facing danger in tough situations during interviews.
 

 
She knew how to handle thugs. She wasn’t easy to deal with.
 

 
She then told the Ma boxer that she had taken his photo and threatened to uncover his real identity, showing him the cloud album on her phone. “Smashing my phone won’t help. The photos are already uploaded to my boyfriend’s device… Of course, I really don’t want to resort to such harsh methods. My father often says that martial arts gatherings are meant to foster friendship, not to indulge in violence.”
 

 
The Plum Blossom Swordsman was stunned, shaking his head, "Matters of the martial world should never involve ordinary people."
 

 
In the story's setting, the Plum Blossom Swordsman is a high school teacher, not a villain, and he is very reluctant to reveal his identity. This is something the protagonist will discover as the main plot unfolds.
 

 
Shuyi mimicked his sigh and said, "There's nothing we can do. Young people these days just don’t follow the old code of honor."
 

 
As expected, there was no fight. Instead, she cleverly steered the conversation toward the movie’s central plot—the theft case—gleaning a lot of information that shouldn’t have been let slip. The Plum Blossom Swordsman, who had been highly guarded around Duan Ge, opened up to Shen Shuyi like a middle-aged man venting his frustrations.
 

 
Even the only true villain, the notorious thief Fu Xuancheng, was subtly influenced by her. He impulsively blurted out something meaningful:
 

 
"Maybe the person who stole the artifact didn’t actually intend to frame us."
 

 
Shen Shuyi gave him a long, thoughtful look.
 

 
…
 

 
The audition ended the moment the protagonist and the antagonist's eyes met.
 

 
The entire casting room could hardly believe that the person who had just auditioned twice was the same actor.
 

 
The assistant director no longer accused Tong Zhao of trying to grandstand. Instead, he turned to the director and asked, "Director Shi, what’s your evaluation of her second audition?”
# Chapter81
All eyes were focused on Director Shi, waiting for his evaluation.
 

 
“If we only discuss Tong Zhao's second audition, you’ll notice that her posture was much lower than in the first audition. Here, 'lower' doesn’t mean humble; it means she was more willing to listen to other characters and wanted to understand them. During both auditions, Cheng Siwen reminded Tong Zhao that the villain was Fu Xuancheng…”
 

 
“In the first audition, Tong Zhao was obviously wary of him. She and the other characters were in a binary opposition; you could see that she was confrontational with everyone, but she took good care of Cheng Siwen, who obeyed her.” Director Shi pulled up a short clip where Duan Ge signaled for him to go to the back with his eyes, actually using himself to block the gaze that others were directing at Cheng Siwen.
 

 
“However, in the second audition, aside from her initially asserting her strength and boundaries, her communication with the other supporting characters was very open and inclusive throughout.”
 

 
Director Shi paused for a moment, coming up with a nickname for her: “The Plum Blossom Swordsman is very resistant to Tong Zhao One but feels a sense of familiarity with Tong Zhao Two. He is even willing to share a lot of information with her that he didn’t mention in the first audition.”
 

 
To direct a good film in the era of instinctive cinema, one must understand human nature very well and possess keen observational skills.
 

 
Because it captures the truest reactions, it's akin to temporarily holding the power of God.
 

 
“It's incredible that the same person can express so many different facets.”
 

 
“I prefer Tong Zhao One; she’s powerful. Whether you give her a saber or a sword, it should work well.”
 

 
“Just watch 'Heartless Tribulation,' and you’ll see that Tong Zhao is, in my mind, the most suitable woman to wield a sword—bar none.”
 

 
It was during this discussion that the team realized there were hidden fans of Tong Zhao among them.
 

 
As the auditions concluded, the other supporting actors gradually woke up and entered the room. Seeing everyone so engrossed in conversation, Tang Yanhao, who played Cheng Siwen, curiously asked, “How did I perform just now?”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The audition room fell into silence as if someone had pressed the mute button.
 

 
He immediately grew anxious: “Did I mess up my performance?”
 

 
“No, you didn’t mess up,” the screenwriter said sympathetically as he put a hand on his shoulder, “You were overshadowed…”
 

 
As soon as Tang Yanhao entered, everyone suddenly realized that all they could remember was Tong Zhao, and the focus during the audition had been entirely on her… In "The Knives of the Maiden," Xie Guiya is undoubtedly the main character, but Cheng Siwen is also an important supporting character throughout the film, and in the earlier audition, this sunny and handsome boy was quite charming.
 

 
On screen, Tong Zhao was like a vortex, drawing the audience’s attention.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Was it her beautiful face? Cheng Siwen was also a handsome guy!
 

 
The director commented, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious gives her a stronger dramatic presence; you always feel like she’ll create some kind of commotion. It’s very dramatic.”
 

 
Using terms like “drama queen” or “overly dramatic” can carry slightly negative connotations.
 

 
So in the end, he chose a commonly used foreign adjective.
 

 
The people present were indeed elites in the instinctive film industry. Even if they didn’t know the source of Tong Zhao’s charm, they had indirectly guessed it—because her personality was born out of the experiences from her quick-changing roles; she was living a life that was anything but ordinary, and her subconscious could constantly provide dramatic expressions.
 

 
Director Shi looked thoughtfully at the two screens displaying Tong Zhao in different outfits.
 

 
“It’s difficult to evaluate as a whole, but I have a bold idea.”
 

 
Although Director Shi was not young, he had always been daring in innovation within the industry.
 

 
Despite the fact that he could easily make money by filming straightforward martial arts movies, he still chose to challenge himself by incorporating new elements that had rarely been explored before. Upon hearing this, everyone cast curious glances at him, while only the screenwriter nervously asked, “So, does that mean we need to change the script?”
 

 
“It’s unrelated to the script. I need to discuss it with the director.”
 

 
The screenwriter visibly relaxed upon hearing this.
 

 
As long as there was no need to change the script!
 

 
After Director Shi finished speaking, he delegated a few miscellaneous tasks and left the audition room with the director. As they walked, their voices were not loud, but they didn’t avoid being heard by others. Consequently, some gossipers perked up their ears, and passersby in the hallway caught fragments of their conversation—
 

 
“... too extroverted, hard to rein in...”
 

 
“... not as good as the first time...”
 

 
“... there will be difficulties in filming... increased costs... subconscious changes...”
 

 
Eventually, the two entered the elevator.
 

 
Once the heavy metal elevator doors closed, silence fell, effectively cutting off the curious ears that had been listening in.
 

 
Director Shi had a bit of an accent, and when he got excited, his voice would increase in volume.
 

 
This was the content that all the gossipers intermittently caught; when pieced together, it seemed to convey that they were quite critical of Tong Zhao, suggesting that she was not as good as Qin Meizi, who had come for the audition the first time, and that they were criticizing the instability of Tong Zhao’s subconscious.
 

 
So that was it!
 

 
It seemed that despite Tong Zhao’s elaborate efforts to audition twice, she ultimately still failed.
 

 
Upon reaching this conclusion, everyone’s eyes sparkled with excitement as they couldn’t wait to share the “firsthand information” with their friends during the waiting period for notifications—
 

 
[That popular female celebrity really came to audition for Director Shi's new project, and the result was quite shocking.]
 

 
[She wasn’t selected, wasn’t selected. But that’s not the main point; the key is that she requested to audition for the same segment twice, saying she had two sides to her subconscious, possibly thinking that this would be eye-catching… somehow, maybe she wanted to score points in front of the director? But in the end, that was also why she wasn’t chosen.]
 

 
[It seems they felt she was not as good as Qin Yisi.]
 

 
[Exactly, actually Uncle Dingjun is very kind; he’s not as fierce as the outside world thinks. The instinctive film industry is also not as mysterious as outsiders imagine. I learned from Uncle Dingjun that even if you’re a celebrity, you shouldn’t get carried away by marketing hype and fans; you still need to be grounded. Having a diverse subconscious can bring too many disadvantages to filming, not to mention she’s so expensive.]
 

 
[I don’t know the exact price, but I heard Tong Zhao's current worth is this amount! ￥￥￥￥￥￥￥￥]
 

 
……
 

 
Such conversations quietly spread.
 

 
Those indulging in this gossip reveled in schadenfreude.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s path had been too smooth. The resources she started with weren’t even top-tier, yet within a year, she not only participated in the Li Zhi TV gala but also starred in the highly acclaimed and commercially successful film "Heartless Tribulation." While her fans were enjoying her success, her peers were filled with envy.
 

 
They didn’t consider themselves to be saints who could calmly watch their peers succeed; it was entirely normal to gossip and share rumors.
 

 
As for those without malice, they were individuals who could never compete with Tong Zhao, and since they had no grounds for envy, they merely felt pleased to flaunt their insider connections to friends, pretending to be well-informed and savvy—so-called “insiders.”
 

 
Such people are not uncommon; if one has a broad social circle, they can easily find such discussions in their friend group.
 

 
A shared photo, and in their words, “Isn’t that old X? We often hang out; if there’s a gathering, I’ll definitely be invited.” When a certain new movie is released, they express their feelings as if they shared an intimate friendship, while no one in their friend circle can truly validate the grandeur of their connections with that high-profile individual.
 

 
What happens when these people catch even a whiff of genuine gossip?
 

 
When they pry out even a morsel of real news from celebrities?
 

 
That’s something else.
 

 
Goodness, that could provide a year’s worth of conversation material.
 

 
From Shi Dingjun’s perspective, commenting on the recently pursued stars by film companies and directors, picking apart details, satisfied a portion of people’s hidden sense of superiority.
 

 
Shi Dingjun and the director were completely unaware of this.
 

 
After all, their original words were...
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 1 is a bit too extroverted and hard to rein in, you know? That kind of feeling makes the audience be unreasonably drawn to her, which is very useful during the film's climax, but if she stays like that throughout the entire film, it will be unbalanced. I’ve seen her in 'Countdown 72 Hours' and 'One Life Survivor,' and there are obvious structural issues in both; although 'Countdown' is labeled as a movie, it actually has a heavy component of live variety show.”
 

 
—“Tong Zhao No. 2 is not as indulgent as the first time; she’s much more restrained.”
 

 
—“Each version of Tong Zhao has particular points that fit perfectly with Xie Guiya. I want them all! I really want to film with her! However, doing so would pose difficulties in production and objectively increase costs; I wonder if her subconscious changes can remain stable…”
 

 
That disdain and frustration are the happy troubles of someone who is too good at everything.
 

 
It’s a kind of Versailles-style complaint.
 

 
After reaching a consensus with the director, he made a phone call to have Tong Zhao, who was drinking tea in the lounge, return to wait for the official filming to begin. He clearly expressed his thoughts, hoping she could cooperate with his immature concept: “Let’s put it this way, this lead role feels like it has to be you. I hope you can keep this schedule, but I’m also filming like this for the first time, which is quite risky. I can afford to lose, but you may not be able to. If you discuss it with your agent and feel it’s not worth the risk and want to decline, that’s perfectly fine.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun spoke candidly.
 

 
He was a renowned director, with his last two films being very successful; no one would deny his status in the film industry due to one less successful innovation. He could afford to be a graceful loser.
 

 
Tong Zhao was an emerging female star, and every filming opportunity was precious.
 

 
Moreover, in the eyes of others, Director Shi's high-budget productions were bound to be successful. If his film flopped, it would also affect her reputation among the public and within the industry.
 

 
In others' eyes, Shi Dingjun's films were indeed a hot commodity.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had many choices now and really didn’t need to take this risk; even shooting a historical drama would be a safer option.
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment, then smiled:
 

 
“I like your idea, Director Shi. As long as you dare to offer me the role of Xie Guiya, I will dare to take it.”
 

 
One of her characteristics was her willingness to take risks.
 

 
The two clicked immediately.
 

 
Tong Zhao happily sat in the van back home. After connecting with two different personalities during the holographic film shoot today, she felt a bit fatigued from switching back and forth like changing tapes. So, she lit a soothing aromatherapy candle, wrapped herself tightly in a blanket on the sofa, and dozed off for a bit. As a result, the scent of the new ebony and bergamot aromatherapy candle was just to her liking, and she ended up sleeping until evening, her memories of the audition refreshed.
 

 
Shuyi: [Wow, Duan Ge is so fierce.]
 

 
Duan Ge: 【The plot requires it; didn’t you hit him too? You’ve probably beaten up people during interviews before.】
 

 
Shuyi once disguised herself to infiltrate a whaling base in the East. Due to carelessness, she was discovered and had to take down the three people who found her—but at the time, she had very handy weapons and equipment since she was prepared for danger when she infiltrated.
 

 
Shu Yi: [Isn’t it reasonable for a reporter who must deal with ruthless criminals to know a bit of self-defense?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Hmm, a little bit.]
 

 
The two exchanged a knowing smile.
 

 
As Tong Zhao groggily made her way to the bathroom to wash her face, she listened to their quiet conversation in her mind, feeling particularly good.
 

 
One of the reasons for her good mood was the brand-new interpretation method proposed by Director Shi, which she found quite appealing—
 

 
She recalled what Director Shi had said:
 

 
“Tong Zhao, you can steadily switch between two states, could you use your second audition self for the first half, and for the second half... I need the explosive power and commanding presence you presented to me in the first audition!”
# Chapter82
Tong Zhao was particularly happy.
 

 
“A movie means double the experience; once it's finished, Zhao Zai should be able to come out.”
 

 
Ever since her head got caught in the door last time, Zhao Zai had given up her curious behavior of peeking around. Instead, Concubine Chen often came to tease her, like someone playing with a little seal at the zoo. Lu Xianzhang felt sorry for Zhao Zai, thankful that during her time as a concubine, she had never had children; otherwise, she would likely have ended up as someone who was played with by her own mother to pass the time.
 

 
Zhao Zai said she would challenge Concubine Chen when she came out.
 

 
Concubine Chen: “Jump up and hit my knees? I’m so scared.”
 

 
Tong Zhao patted essence on her face.
 

 
In fact, these effects were not as good as her practice in cultivation. Even just sitting quietly for an hour to absorb the essence of heaven and earth had better results than any beauty treatment. It was just that she enjoyed having all those bottles and jars in her bathroom, and the thrill of buying skincare products in bulk when they were on sale.
 

 
After finishing her skincare routine, Tong Zhao lay back in her massage chair, preparing to check on Ze Shan’s work progress.
 

 
Everything was going smoothly.
 

 
“Little Lamb Playmate” was being launched into the market step by step according to her planned publicity strategy. The high costs originally set aside for celebrity endorsements had been redistributed to hire various game streamers and video content creators to produce embedded advertisements.
 

 
“Is the opposing team’s support taking down the Wild King? Come to ‘Little Lamb Playmate’! You can find any king here and even listen to voice lines.”
 

 
In the gaming lobby, seeking help from the Wild King? By spending money on “Little Lamb Playmate,” you could enjoy the thrill of selecting a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao instructed that the app’s categories be more detailed; not only should the ranks be differentiated, but they could also be specified down to hero names as keywords—like if a boss wanted to learn to play the hero Yun Zhongjun, they could simply look for a top player specializing in Yun Zhongjun’s skills, ensuring they wouldn’t lead novices astray.
 

 
By the time others noticed the business opportunities in this field, it was already too late.
 

 
The players established fixed relationships with bosses in “Little Lamb Playmate,” and users were accustomed to spending money there.
 

 
Just this “habit” was worth its weight in gold.
 

 
Being the first to take the plunge had its advantages.
 

 
Tong Zhao calculated her earnings from “Little Lamb Playmate” and, satisfied, closed the app. She also reminded Wei Zekai: “Remember to prohibit any offline transactions and never arrange offline meetings through the app. Although many users want a local function, it’s too risky to open that up. If they want a casual encounter, they should find their partners in the private spaces instead of through our application.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Okay.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “What does blind box have to do with this?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “... It’s like instant local matchmaking; you add each other in the morning and meet in the afternoon without knowing what the other person looks like. That’s why it’s called a blind box.”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked shocked.
 

 
He had gained some useless knowledge.
 

 
Not really liking this method, he thought about what he wanted to say the most today: “By the way, a momentary failure doesn’t mean anything; you are the best.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I will always firmly choose you!”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If you don’t want to talk about this, I won’t say anything more. But I hope Tong Zhao knows that each of us at Ze Shan is your solid support, especially me.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Music Link: My Good Brother - Xiao Shenyang & Gao Jin]”
 

 
Tong Zhao accidentally clicked on the link, and the song began to play.
 

 
‘My good brother, if you have troubles, you tell me. When you need me, I will accompany you through it together.’ [Note]
 

 
Tong Zhao: “……… ”
 

 
She didn’t know what was wrong with this guy.
 

 
Just as she was about to ask, her manager called, telling her not to pay attention to the rumors outside and that the next opportunity would be even better.
 

 
Ten minutes earlier, Tong Zhao had felt quite pleased with herself.
 

 
Ten minutes later, her good friend and manager sent her comforting messages.
 

 
This left Tong Zhao puzzled.
 

 
But this wasn’t the first time; she clearly felt she was quite impervious to attacks, yet those around her seemed to feel distressed even when she bumped into something.
 

 
“First, explain what the outside rumors are about.”
 

 
“They said that you mentioned your subconscious has various forms and wanted to showcase them separately to Director Shi. Wasting two audition opportunities and still getting rejected, some things were said quite harshly. They said it’s ridiculous that you treat your unstable, distorted subconscious as a selling point in front of a big director. They won’t increase costs because of your instability; you really think too highly of yourself.”
 

 
Sister Chu paused and then comforted her, saying, “It’s just jealousy. Those who have achieved more than you and are currently more famous certainly wouldn’t think that way.”
 

 
However, Tong Zhao held the opposite view:
 

 
“If they really didn’t think that way, then the entertainment industry wouldn’t have the term ‘bomb-proof’.”
 

 
The cake is only so big.
 

 
If she gets a role, it inevitably means someone else loses a role.
 

 
Actors with subconscious-driven film roles generally have more rigid paths and typically only compete with similar types.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was an outlier; anyone could be threatened by her.
 

 
Right now, everything she acted in became a hit; no one wanted to clash with her ratings. As long as she expressed interest in acting… even if it was just a script without a production team, there would be investors willing to back her. What couldn’t be accomplished with money? Aside from directors of Director Shi’s caliber, there were plenty of directors wanting to collaborate with Tong Zhao. Shi Qianqiu was just sitting there and doing nothing, saying he didn’t want to shoot a new movie for the time being—unless Tong Zhao acted in it.
 

 
Sister Chu: “You have a point.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Others are fine with just one bowl of rice; you want to set a banquet at home.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed at this description.
 

 
Isn’t that right? She could indeed host a grand feast in her mind.
 

 
After laughing, Tong Zhao collected herself and said, “The main issue is that they got it wrong from the beginning. Where did they hear such false news? Director Shi has already settled on me. However, the increased costs need to be discussed with the investors. He was very confident in his tone, saying he has some influence with the investors and asked me to give him two days. He will definitely give me a response by Sunday.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s time was precious; she wouldn’t get stuck on a single project.
 

 
So, waiting two days was also a matter of giving Director Shi face.
 

 
Sister Chu felt happy for her after hearing this, but she was also puzzled—how did this rumor spread?
 

 
This was easy to investigate.
 

 
After all, a group of people were vividly claiming that they had personally heard Director Shi say it.
 

 
As it circulated, the final version morphed into a sensational story about how “the domineering little flower wanted to show off in front of the veteran director but ended up being eliminated instead,” which was very satisfying for those who spread it.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a phone call to ask the director himself. Director Shi was baffled, denied the rumors three times, and then told her the original words. He didn’t think she was making a big deal out of it; instead, he comforted her: “Stability in the subconscious is important. If this were your first performance, I might be worried, but your past performances have been so stable that I don’t need to worry at all! The audition effect you presented to me is worth the risk. You’re still young and new in the industry; too many people are envious of you. Such talk is normal, just wait for the official announcement.”
 

 
Director Shi had a good impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Moreover, since his master was quite fond of her, they might even have a future as fellow disciples, so he naturally was willing to say a few more words.
 

 
“By the way, do you have time the night after tomorrow? My master’s birthday is being celebrated at Ming Yun Restaurant, and I’d like to invite you to dinner. But it’s in Qin City… If you come, I will arrange for someone to pick you up.”
 

 
Taking the opportunity, Director Shi extended the invitation.
 

 
Tong Zhao checked her schedule; she had nothing planned for that day, so it would be a good chance to visit Qin City.
 

 
While enjoying peace and rest at home was nice, she also needed to get out and about.
 

 
One of the benefits of her quick-wear experiences was that she had endless energy and initiative. She didn’t need others to tell her what to do, nor did she require prompting; she would take the initiative to get things done and would find tasks to occupy herself with if there was nothing to do—she simply couldn’t sit still. Sister Chu often joked that among the artists she managed, Zhao Zhao was the one who needed the least coaxing. When the schedule was set, and she called to confirm, the answer she always received was full of energy, along with a readiness to go out at any time.
 

 
That’s why she was the most cherished by her.
 

 
“Okay, then I’ll see you the night after tomorrow.”
 

 
Once Tong Zhao settled this, she told Sister Chu not to schedule any other work for her in the meantime.
 

 
She also sent a message to that overly worried guy: “Don’t overthink it; I wasn’t eliminated. The role is mine now.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “ [Surprised expression of the host holding open their eyelids with two fingers.jpg]”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[Snape clapping meme.jpg]”
 

 
…This guy's collection of memes was truly unfathomable.
 

 
After hanging up, Sister Chu suddenly realized something was off. The old curator’s birthday?
 

 
She checked, and historically, the old curator's birthday was a star-studded event, especially for those who had acted in action films. No one would dare to offend him. However, in the past, it had never been grand; he only invited his disciples and familiar faces. This year marked his sixtieth birthday, and they were preparing for a big celebration at Ming Yun Restaurant.
 

 
Ming Yun Restaurant was also a prestigious place.
 

 
It was the highest-rated restaurant in Qin City, and many celebrities and wealthy businessmen chose to host banquets on the top three floors.
 

 
It wasn’t just a simple birthday celebration for a friend!
 

 
Sister Chu was speechless and more anxious than Tong Zhao herself. She hurriedly booked the best stylist and formal wear she could find on short notice, determined to dress her up beautifully. There would be reporters and other film stars on site, and once the photos hit the streets, who would dare say Director Shi looked down on her?
 

 
Tong Zhao was clearly informed about the arrangements, while her manager was already starting to take out loans to prove a point.
 

 
She didn’t feel much about it; her manager said, “If they can mock with loans, why can’t I enjoy myself with one? They talk as if it’s true; Director Shi is on good terms with our Zhao Zhao!”
 

 
Tong Zhao found this line of reasoning a bit strange.
 

 
But it was no wonder Sister Chu was angry. The confidentiality of the auditions that day was not very high, and once rumors started circulating, they spread like wildfire. Some were screenshot and shared within small circles of friends, eventually landing in the hands of marketing accounts, presented as half-truths.
 

 
@Guajie Breaks the News:
 

 
Guess who this female star is?
 

 
[Content of the screenshot from the Moments: “I can’t help but say this is too funny ! When I went to the audition today, I encountered Director Shi auditioning for ‘The Knives of the Maiden' and overheard a scoop… A certain female star who debuted a year ago claimed her subconscious was very special and wanted two audition chances. In the end, she didn’t make it after trying twice . The director and the supervisor said she was too unstable, which would increase costs.”]
 

 
Comments on Moments:
 

 
“Really? Who is it?”
 

 
Reply: “TZ (in a low voice)”
 

 
“Wow, didn’t she say she rejected a lot of scripts? Is she just waiting for this one? It’s so unfortunate to be eliminated.”
 

 
Reply: “I think the director doesn’t like her being too dramatic. If she had auditioned well, maybe she’d still have a chance.”
 

 
These snarky screenshots from Moments were like water hitting a hot oil pan; they exploded.
 

 
It was too easy to guess.
 

 
The points about being in the industry for a year and subconsciousness, coupled with the initials, were practically the same as naming her outright.
 

 
[TZ can only be Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[It’s normal to fail an audition once; is it necessary to be so sarcastic? She didn’t use this to promote herself.]
 

 
[Can’t her fans just stop being so smug?]
 

 
[Hmm, it’s probably because saying the truth sounds like bragging; a niche reality show blew up, and a leading lady film broke records on its opening day, but now she’s being buried in the ground after one failed audition… I’m just speaking the truth for some jealous folks; no need to thank me!]
 

 
In the entertainment industry, whether fans or haters, everyone was a super big gossip monger.
 

 
The comments and shares became chaotic, and occasionally an uninformed bystander would wander in, noticing countless mentions of the name in the hot comments, yet there were still people asking—
 

 
[Who are you all talking about? Why do you all look like you know what's going on?]
 

 
Good grief, they’re jumping from Bilibili to Weibo, wanting the gossip served to them on a platter, even saving the effort of chewing.
 

 
Bystanders are just enjoying the show, while fans are genuinely invested.
 

 
The battle between fans and haters in the comments of this Weibo post, coupled with Tong Zhao's increased fame following the Li Zhi TV gala, has led many to pay attention to what role she would take next. Fans were eagerly looking forward to her breaking new records, but instead, they got the news that she turned down many scripts and failed auditions, which must have been disappointing.
 

 
If it were just a private disappointment, that would be one thing.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao had only debuted for a short while, her foundation was solid, and among her fanbase, many top-tier fans wouldn't just run away after a small setback.
 

 
However, being exposed to the sunlight felt entirely different.
 

 
But thinking about it, with Tong Zhao’s current popularity, it was impossible for her to just quietly fade away. Countless pairs of eyes were watching her; if she stumbled, people would gather around to share the news, loudly announcing to the entire fan community: Tong—Zhao—has—fallen!
 

 
After a day of noise, no serious figure had stepped up to speak out.
 

 
That made sense, though; during auditions, there were too many voices. When it came time to decide who would play the lead role, it was a discussion between higher-ups and investors, and irrelevant people couldn't possibly hear it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious and wanted to post on Weibo to throw down the gauntlet.
 

 
Wasn’t it just arguing?
 

 
Although he wasn’t good at being sarcastic, he was still a seasoned gamer from Zu'an, capable of handling pressure and taking the blame like a veteran!
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped him: "If you step out, people really won’t care about my audition anymore; they’ll just think I've been officially announced."
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t understand: "Isn’t an official announcement a good thing? Didn’t Director Shi book you?"
 

 
"It's not about the movie announcement,"
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed: "It's about our relationship being announced."
 

 
This statement successfully stopped Wei Zekai’s impulsive behavior.
 

 
A day later, an entertainment news piece was released by Sina Entertainment.
 

 
“Tong Zhao Appears at Director Deng’s 60th Birthday Banquet”
 

 
Subsequently, many credible entertainment accounts released:
 

 
“Director Shi and Tong Zhao Enjoy a Happy Conversation? Mrs. Shi: A particularly spirited young girl.”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s simple yet elegant appearance stuns everyone; Director Shi clarifies the rumors.”
 

 
“Official Announcement of the Female Lead in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’!”
 

 
The agent, who had been holding in a surge of anger, especially used her connections this time to ensure a photographer at the event took a flattering picture of Tong Zhao—this was incredibly easy for reporters, as Tong Zhao was already a somewhat famous beauty in the industry with no bad angles. It would take a lot of effort and skill to get a bad photo of her; they would need to amp up their techniques to get even an average shot.
 

 
In short, each piece of news was tacitly accompanied by a photo of Tong Zhao sitting next to the old director and his wife, surrounded by her senior brothers and sisters. She wore an elegant gray gown adorned with eagle feathers, her long hair styled up, revealing her graceful swan neck and beautifully defined shoulders...
 

 
Sister Chu put in a lot of effort; she certainly wouldn’t let her agent's hard work go to waste.
 

 
Throughout the event, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of a regal beauty, successfully capturing a multitude of camera shots.
 

 
Once the news broke...
 

 
It was as if the haters who had been shouting, “Can you beat my 17 cards?” were suddenly swept away by a massive bomb and a plane, all accompanied by joyful sounds of a suona!
# Chapter83
What on earth is going on?
 

 
Forget about the haters and bystanders; even the fans, who should have first-hand information, are at a loss and can only rush to share in the fan groups, hoping to get clarification from the fans with better sources.
 

 
Both the fans and the haters are confused.
 

 
Many of the well-informed fans and studio leaders collaborate with entertainment companies, achieving mutual benefits and collectively reaping profits, aiming for a goal of shared prosperity.
 

 
Tong Zhao's contract with the company is quite flexible. She has also emphasized to her manager that she does not want to follow the idol route, so her fans naturally formed on their own without the need for deliberate cultivation—
 

 
Thus, Tong Zhao's fan base has a relatively average fighting capacity.
 

 
Unless provoked by someone else, they will never rush to respond.
 

 
Some in the fandom feel that Tong Zhao's camp lacks the right atmosphere and doesn’t have that sought-after flavor of the domestic entertainment industry. However, Tong Zhao's fandom is also one of the more comfortable ones for outsiders to support, as they don’t focus rigidly on album sales or engage in various messy voting schemes, while also dabbling in other fields that occasionally surprise fans.
 

 
With pros come cons, and Tong Zhao is quite satisfied with the current state of affairs.
 

 
Overall, it’s just fine. She isn’t planning a rebellion or preparing private troops, nor does she want to be the leader of a crab cult that unifies the world for generations.
 

 
During the fans' period of confusion, they noticed that Director Shi followed Tong Zhao—
 

 
@Shi Dingjunv:
 

 
"Welcome the lead actress of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and our little junior sister @Tong Zhao!"
 

 
[Audition Screenshot 1.JPG][Audition Screenshot 2.JPG]
 

 
……
 

 
[So she really became a junior sister? Congratulations to Director Shi.]
 

 
[Oh my gosh, a plot twist??? So the marketing accounts were spreading fake news??? @Guajie, come out and get beaten up.]
 

 
[Wasn’t it said that she had high aspirations and used her unique subconscious as a gimmick, and that she got scolded by you??? How did she turn around??? Did she ultimately bow to capital???]
 

 
This is a suggestion that Tong Zhao has capital backing her.
 

 
Even though she had publicly distanced herself from the Tong family long ago and retained her surname simply because it shares a character with her mother’s, she had also cut ties with Tong Zhenming and had a reputation that was not merely damaged, but practically shattered. If she wasn’t stepped on, it would be a stroke of luck; how could anyone help her? But she also has a wealthy and unattainable rumored boyfriend, Wei Zekai, along with the entertainment company behind her.
 

 
Conspiracy theories never go out of style.
 

 
There are no absolutes in this world; from another perspective, it’s a good thing for the public to remain vigilant.
 

 
Shi Dingjun responded directly to this comment: "After the audition, I planned to finalize Tong Zhao. However, because we intended to use a special filming method, it would increase certain costs, so I needed to discuss it with the investors. They ultimately strongly supported my decision. I only heard about this rumor today; I was too busy preparing for the master’s birthday and the new movie... That rumor has been false since I first trained her; it’s all misinformation."
 

 
To increase his credibility, Shi Dingjun even posted a comment with a picture.
 

 
It was a record of his WeChat conversations with Tong Zhao, clearly showing that they added each other as friends on the morning of the audition. After the audition, they chatted for a bit, and the conversation was filled with appreciation. From the timing of their discussions, it was clear that any notion of capital pressure was nonexistent, and he liked Tong Zhao very much.
 

 
So where did the rumors come from?
 

 
Director Shi said it might have originated from the conversation he had with the supervisor after the audition. They both came from the same hometown and spoke a mix of dialect and Mandarin. Some people only understood part of the conversation and took it upon themselves to spread it as a serious rumor, which is quite unethical. He hopes the rumors can stop.
 

 
This blocked the last point of doubt.
 

 
Shi Dingjun has a great image, and his words carry weight more than anything else.
 

 
[It’s too funny to be a bystander during all this hhhhh]
 

 
[Got it, the end result of mocking with loans is getting slapped in the face.]
 

 
[A little bit of rumor-catching drew all the foolish haters out; I’d call it a skill.]
 

 
Fans who were previously anxious suddenly found their backbone.
 

 
In reality, being eliminated from the audition isn’t a big deal.
 

 
However, being publicly scolded by the well-liked and prominent Director Shi is quite an embarrassing black mark, and it’s likely to resurface in the future whenever there’s a dispute with other companies.
 

 
With the burden lifted, it’s time to settle accounts with the rumor mongers!
 

 
[Seriously, think about how awkward this is. How long have Director Shi and Tong Zhao known each other? If it were someone else, and there were all these rumors about that person badmouthing you behind your back, would you still consider them a friend? The rumor mongers have dirty hearts; I hope they get their mouths sewn shut in the future.]
 

 
The true source of the rumors is untraceable, but the origin of the sarcastic posts that really spread them is easy to find.
 

 
It was a minor role who didn’t leave after the audition that day, named Yun Zhiran. Her level of fame is only slightly different from that of a regular person; she had never landed an important role before, so just getting a minor role with lines in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ is a breakthrough for her.
 

 
Fans are itching to confront her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao first retweeted her thanks to Shi Dingjun and then posted a new Weibo update.
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 

 
"I hope the audience can find joy in my work.
 

 
I hope my fans can draw positive energy from liking me; there’s no need to fight for me, and don’t hate or belittle others because of me. I will fight my own battles, and I will walk my own path. When I’m weary, you support me; when I’m weak, you encourage me; when I succeed, I can share it with you. That is enough."
 

 
This statement was calculated and well-considered.
 

 
Of course, fans need to be restrained. At the very least, she herself set the tone; even if they want to act out, it won’t be too outrageous. By nipping the signs of toxicity in the bud at the beginning, it can prevent things from spiraling out of control later—why are there so many instances of "bystanders wishing for her downfall, while fans wish nothing but for their idol to thrive"? Because short-sightedness for immediate gains set a bad precedent, and the fan groups that developed afterward resemble a high-speed car with malfunctioning brakes, completely out of control and impossible to rein in even by the idol herself.
 

 
Why not stop it?
 

 
Because the capital behind the idol has already earned its money, and there are very few young idols with the foresight and resources to reject toxic fan behavior from the start.
 

 
If you won’t support me, I’ll find someone else to lift up.
 

 
Why not support them?
 

 
After all, they’re just a fast-moving product that will only be popular for one or two years. If they lose control, they can just disappear from the entertainment industry with a fortune.
 

 
In this world, everyone is bustling for profit; the world is chaotic because of profit flowing away.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that her fans were excited, and it wouldn’t be good to harshly criticize them or pour cold water on their enthusiasm. So, she chose to give a more gentle hint, affirming the unwavering support her fans had shown her lately.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t afraid that her fans wouldn’t understand.
 

 
What is there for fans to misunderstand? Most people in the fandom have excellent reading comprehension skills.
 

 
[Got it, we won’t give our sister any trouble; good luck to her in her new drama! /Heart emoji [Tong Zhao cute expression pack.jpg]]
 

 
[Quietly waiting for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’; Sister looked so beautiful at the birthday banquet! [Edited high-quality photo.jpg]]
 

 
[We don’t spread hate / We’re cute, we also don’t belittle others / So happy, hope the rumor-mongering monsters stay away from our sister / Smile]
 

 
This sarcastic Weibo post and the three default expressions show the repressed anger of some of the more combative fans, warning certain competitors who can’t stand Tong Zhao’s success and bored haters to focus on their own happy lives and not bother them anymore.
 

 
After Tong Zhao posted on Weibo, she glanced at the comments, knowing it was enough that her mainstream fans had received her message.
 

 
After all, a celebrity's fanbase influences each other.
 

 
She found it quite interesting to look at the comments on her Weibo.
 

 
If only everyone would talk without constantly posting her photos, it’s a bit too brainwashing; she had become numb to it and was starting to lose the ability to discern her own beauty from ugliness.
 

 
After soothing her fans, Tong Zhao didn’t intend to suffer insults without reason.
 

 
She directly told Director Shi to remove Yun Zhiran from her role, with a ready-made justification—someone who spreads half-truths and rumors clearly has questionable character. Moreover, if she has such strong opinions about the lead, what if that hatred unconsciously affects her and leads to a big problem during filming, like stabbing the lead with a knife? A minor role can be easily swapped out.
 

 
The director’s reply was: “Actually, I was already planning to cut her anyway.”
 

 
After all, half of this rumor was pinned on him, which was quite unfair.
 

 
When Yun Zhiran received the news that she had been temporarily cut from the role, she was momentarily stunned. Putting together the current events, she guessed it had something to do with Tong Zhao—she believed that Director Shi wouldn’t hold a grudge against a young girl; it had to be a case of women making things difficult for each other. It was just like how she felt a sense of secret joy when she heard that Tong Zhao had “failed” the audition and was eager to have more people witness her downfall. Yun Zhiran managed to obtain Tong Zhao's work WeChat through some minor methods, hoping to apologize and plead for mercy.
 

 
When she saw Yun Zhiran send a long string of messages, Tong Zhao felt not a single ripple of emotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Firstly, I don’t have much say in casting decisions; changing actors is not my responsibility. I’m sorry you lost this role, but I don’t know much about the related matters. If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Then, she blacklisted Yun Zhiran.
 

 
Whether it was a phone call or WeChat, there was always a risk of being screenshot or recorded. Tong Zhao was in the right and wasn’t afraid of a dispute.
 

 
However, she didn’t plan to get entangled in endless disputes with a minor role; it would be too embarrassing. If this were a TV drama, this minor character would only be a brief interlude to adjust the pacing; wanting the lead to interact with them for three or four episodes? They’d need at least a top star for that!
 

 
Yun Zhiran felt a tightness in her chest from Tong Zhao’s last line: “If you do well in your audition, perhaps you’ll have more opportunities.”
 

 
Because she had mocked Tong Zhao in her social circle with the line, “It’s the director who doesn’t like her being too dramatic; if she auditions well, there might still be opportunities,” now that the same words were thrown back at her, Yun Zhiran felt like she was having a heart attack. Tong Zhao guessed correctly; she indeed wanted to argue with Tong Zhao. By stirring up controversy, she could gain heat and attention. Unfortunately, Tong Zhao didn’t fall for it and remained calm, which made her uncomfortable.
 

 
As she was about to say something, she received a red exclamation mark.
 

 
Yun Zhiran: “…?”
 

 
Did she just get blacklisted?
 

 
No rebuttal?
 

 
No insults?
 

 
Yun Zhiran had also mocked her on Weibo.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had previously stated not to engage in such antics, the fans who came to her defense were few, and passersby quickly forgot about it. After all, they weren't on the same level; they only knew that Tong Zhao quickly clarified the rumors against her and publicly showcased a great resource, gaining the endorsement of credible figures in the industry and maintaining an excellent image…
 

 
That bit of negative impact dissipated silently.
 

 
At that moment, the criticism Yun Zhiran faced was significantly smaller than the wave of collective mockery directed at Tong Zhao that had arisen after her rumors.
 

 
Spreading rumors felt good at the moment, but when the backlash came, she realized how painful it could be.
 

 
In an instant, Yun Zhiran understood.
 

 
This complete disregard from Tong Zhao truly made her uncomfortable—enjoying fabricating rumors behind someone’s back? That’s fine; just focus on being a rat in the gutter and don’t come prancing in front of her. She wasn’t worthy.
 

 
After Tong Zhao blacklisted Yun Zhiran, she completely removed that name from her mind.
 

 
Just a nobody.
 

 
What mattered more was her reputation.
 

 
This was something her agent and her company had been striving for—
 

 
They didn’t expect to mold Tong Zhao into a flawless person, but if the dirt thrown at the “Tong Zhao” brand was false, they needed to wash it away as much as possible. Fortunately, as Tong Zhao had said, there was no need to escalate it into a messy war of words… After being properly “soothed,” the fans’ anger significantly decreased, and the keywords in their comments shifted from aggressive terms like “rumor-mongering dogs,” “haters,” and “anti-explosion” to a focus on the new drama and Tong Zhao’s appearance at the curator’s birthday banquet.
 

 
Many people on Director Shi’s Weibo were asking what this new filming method that would increase costs was all about.
 

 
Director Shi smiled and said he had to keep it a secret for now.
 

 
But surely they could talk about Tong Zhao becoming their little junior sister?
 

 
Not only did Shi Dingjun generously mention it, but some videos from the birthday banquet also leaked, and many attendees proudly showcased it on Weibo. Sister Chu thought correctly; that night, many important figures from the film industry and political circles gathered, especially since the old curator had made significant contributions to martial arts in China. Those involved in this field had some historical connections; in short, it was no small matter.
 

 
Tong Zhao's careful preparation had not gone to waste.
 

 
Considering this wasn’t a fashion show, being too deliberate would invite ridicule. The stylist chose a subtle and elegant high-grade gray outfit, and her long hair, tied in a ponytail, lessened the formality of the gown while emphasizing a youthful vibe appropriate for her age.
 

 
Many photos with Tong Zhao ended up in the news.
 

 
The fans happily basked in her beauty, putting aside the unpleasantness.
 

 
After all, the sister said she wanted to bring them positive influence.
 

 
Being a fan should be fun!
 

 
Tong Zhao, dazzling with the aura of Consort Chen, managed to handle all the scheming behind the photos where only she was edited in, as no amount of editing would work unless they made her look ugly—then it would be too obvious and would lead to endless mockery from the all-seeing netizens.
 

 
Other female stars also attended the birthday banquet, ready with their glamorous press releases...
 

 
But they seemed a bit unconvincing!
 

 
Especially for those who shared the frame with Tong Zhao; only their own fans could praise them with their eyes closed, while passersby looked on with a face full of “Emmm…”
 

 
Consort Chen felt quite wronged.
 

 
Consort Chen: “I’m just a tool for Zhao Zhao to shine in the spotlight.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Youth fades, but affection has already withered, wuwuwu…”
 

 
Seeing her pretend to cry while covering her face, Tong Zhao was speechless.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m afraid if I let you out for a moment, the sect will turn into a fish pond later.”
 

 
Consort Chen blinked her beautiful and innocent eyes as if asking her: “What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that everything was wrong.
 

 
Because after talking with Elder Deng, when he proposed to take her as his last disciple, the atmosphere was very warm and serious.
 

 
Director Deng explicitly mentioned that he saw her as a good candidate for martial arts, and her subconscious in “One Life Survivor” exhibited a kind of decisive aura that all his disciples lacked... reminiscent of his comrades from his fighting days. When Director Deng was young, he was part of the effort to defend the country, and he admired her particularly: “It would be a shame not to join the military.”
 

 
After a moment of thought, Director Deng added, “Actually, not all disciples are lacking, but those that are, didn’t survive.”
 

 
The disciples he took in their thirties all died on the battlefield.
 

 
The following thirty years witnessed the rapid development of China.
 

 
So, his gaze toward Tong Zhao was filled with nostalgia.
 

 
Aside from Director Deng’s pure fondness for her, the other senior brothers’ friendliness toward her was polite and somewhat distant, knowing she was about to star in Shi Dingjun’s film. Their conversations revolved entirely around the movie. Tong Zhao keenly observed that this sect resembled the Jewish community in Hollywood, supporting younger members and exchanging benefits... Action movies are one of the more profitable genres, and nearly ninety percent of the excellent action films on the market in Huaxia come from Director Deng’s disciples, who wouldn’t be willing to share this cake with outsiders.
 

 
However, there were very few female disciples under Director Deng, making Tong Zhao a low-threat, high-value new member for them.
 

 
From the news and the public’s perspective, Tong Zhao, surrounded by admirers while sitting next to Director Deng, appeared to be the “darling of the group.”
 

 
But at the core, Tong Zhao understood very well…
 

 
This was yet another venue for exchanging benefits, and she had inadvertently obtained a ticket to enter.
 

 
Just like in more traditional settings, there were always the remnants of drinking culture, but no one forced her to drink and no one made vulgar jokes at her expense. Because she was recently very popular and was expected to become even more so, there were no handles or black spots to use against her. Her demeanor constantly emphasized that she did not intend to leverage her beauty to gain anything...
 

 
After a few rounds of drinks, Tong Zhao assisted the elderly director’s wife into a car and remained sober.
 

 
She sat in the nanny van and took out her phone to check the online response.
 

 
The atmosphere was anything but calm.
 

 
In the world of showbiz, one had to keep fighting every day.
 

 
Fans' excited emotions were calmed down; there was no widespread online outrage, and the trolls quickly fell silent. Some even turned their attitudes 180 degrees and angrily criticized the rumor mongers—ironically, the ones who cursed the most fiercely were not Tong Zhao's fans but those who had initially followed the trend to mock her, only to realize they had been slapped in the face.
 

 
Some trolls showed traces of being backed by other groups, and their operations were not clean enough, leaving behind evidence that was noted down.
 

 
Tong Zhao only recognized some names as fellow actresses of the same age group.
 

 
Their faces were blurred, and she had little impression of them.
 

 
The malice directed at her was overwhelming.
 

 
However, this was not a personal grudge; if she accumulated more mocked history, it could indeed tarnish her currently glittering crown for a while.
 

 
The assistant who flew with her to Qin City handed her a thermos: “Sister Zhao, you didn’t eat much at the birthday banquet, did you? Do you want to drink something?”
 

 
Tong Zhao unscrewed the cap, revealing steaming hot chicken soup inside.
 

 
Due to her cultivation practice and good fitness habits, she didn’t pay much attention to her diet. At this moment, she was indeed hungry, so she smiled and thanked her assistant, then lowered her head to sip the chicken soup in small gulps. The rich and fragrant soup soothed the slight turmoil stirred up by the online chaos—
 

 
It was over.
 

 
Whether in reality or the online farce, everything had temporarily come to a close...
 

 
Not so fast!
 

 
Reality does influence the subconscious, so before filming began, Tong Zhao had to stay in Qin City to learn all the martial arts that might be used in “The Knives of the Maiden.” She didn’t aim to master them; at the very least, she wanted to keep the concepts in her mind, which was a kind of “skill” in the film industry, proven to be somewhat helpful.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao’s role in “The Knives of the Maiden” was a done deal, the focus of fans and reporters shifted to—
 

 
Since learning martial arts is so difficult, will she study hard?
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Save the children.”
 

 
Duan Ge: "Okay."
 

 
Shuyi: "Do I also need to learn together?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It's decided. You will take turns sitting in the main character's position, and I'll be in charge of supervision."
# Chapter84
Amateur martial arts practice isn’t hard.
 

 
It’s a very good way to strengthen the body.
 

 
However, starting from a young age is different.
 

 
First, let’s mention that the pain of having a master help you stretch your muscles is deeply ingrained in one’s memory.
 

 
The so-called training comes from the heart, and it is a tedious and painful process that comes from within—like holding a horse stance; can you find joy in that? It’s much harder than lifting weights or doing cardio in a gym. So when Tong Zhao reported to the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy, her senior martial artists in the academy reminded her to never show off in front of Director Deng. If she couldn’t endure it, she must speak up…
 

 
“Just a few years ago, a wealthy businessman who loved collecting antiques and revered traditional Chinese culture used his connections to spend a lot of money to send his grandson here to study martial arts. He wanted the best, and we told him that Director Deng is strict and that following him would definitely be tough, so it would be better to choose some senior brothers who are higher up in the ranking, who are a bit younger and known to be more lenient, knowing that young people can’t handle it,” the sixth senior brother shook his head and sighed. “But that rich man was undeterred and insisted on getting the best. He asked me…”
 

 
Tong Zhao was curious: “What did he ask?”
 

 
The sixth senior brother replied, “He asked if Director Deng had a different price.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
The sixth senior brother was forty this year and had a reliable and honest appearance, making it hard for Tong Zhao to judge if he was joking about Master Deng. He continued, “As a result, the kid was stubborn and refused to admit he was struggling, so Master didn’t really push him to the limit. It was just too tough, and the kid found a chance to sneak back home, saying he didn’t want to come back.”
 

 
“He complained to his parents and caused trouble for the martial arts academy?”
 

 
“Not really,” the sixth senior brother sighed. “The rich man thought his child couldn’t handle the hardship. Director Deng began to doubt his teaching methods were outdated. After that, he refused to accept any more students through connections until he saw you, junior sister…”
 

 
“Master said he was initially impressed by your fighting scenes in the variety show, and later, when he watched the earlier episodes, he found out you could endure hardships very well.”
 

 
“What did he notice specifically?”
 

 
Having heard a lot of flattery from fans, Tong Zhao wanted to know how Director Deng, such an important figure, appreciated her.
 

 
The sixth senior brother appeared more embarrassed: “Those instant noodles without seasoning packets.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Tong Zhao's respect for her master slightly declined.
 

 
In the bustling city of Qin, the martial arts academy felt like a paradise amid a concrete jungle, with a purely traditional Chinese-designed courtyard that was quite elegant. Master Deng and some of his core disciples lived here. Daily expenses came from tuition fees from apprentices and occasional offerings from disciples. Master Deng himself had a substantial fortune, which clearly indicated that he wasn’t short on money.
 

 
Tong Zhao understood that part of this “offering” was a return for Director Deng’s help in connecting her to good resources in the film industry.
 

 
In traditional films, the fighting scenes are judged by the actors; in instinctive films, they are judged by the action designers.
 

 
An excellent action designer is the soul of an action movie; the actors are just puppets controlled by them. Shi Dingjun was not satisfied with filming a puppet, which is why he favored Tong Zhao, who could perform incredibly well without needing action design coding.
 

 
“Master, I’ve brought my junior sister over.”
 

 
As they passed the indoor training hall, the shouting faded away.
 

 
After crossing a picturesque bridge with flowing water, they arrived at a wooden door.
 

 
“Let her in; you go on with your work.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother complied.
 

 
Thinking that Director Deng preferred Duan Ge and that martial arts practice was hard…
 

 
Cough!
 

 
Whether or not she practiced martial arts wasn’t important; what mattered was her respect for the elder.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay, you can go rest now.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Alright!”
 

 
Tong Zhao bounced around like Nobita from "Doraemon" asking for help.
 

 
Although she seemed very mature in front of others, in front of “herself,” she was always that childish kid fantasizing, “If only there were another me to go to school and do homework while I could just play.”
 

 
Duan Ge walked into the study and saw the energetic Director Deng writing calligraphy, just finishing the last character.
 

 
What was he writing?
 

 
A treasure for women?
 

 
Duan Ge took a closer look.
 

 
Oh, it turned out to be “A Warm Welcome.”
 

 
Director Deng smiled and invited her to sit, chatting with her about the operations of the martial arts academy.
 

 
“One month doesn’t really teach much; in the past, it would have just been basic practice. But it can’t be helped; your time is precious,” he said, his tone a bit helpless and annoyed, like he was jealous of fame and fortune. He knew that even though Tong Zhao was a great talent, he wouldn’t be able to keep her by his side to teach her: “The master only hopes that after you finish filming Xiao Jun’s movie, you’ll have time to practice what I taught you. Just don’t forget everything; you’ll need it in the future.”
 

 
Even though he had a high status in the industry and was usually respected, Director Deng didn’t put on airs. Instead, he genuinely treated Tong Zhao as a beloved junior: “When you came, Xiao Liu mentioned the incident where I scared my little disciple back home, right? It really wasn’t that bad; if you had just talked to me, I could have worked something out with you.”
 

 
When mentioning this, Director Deng seemed a bit troubled:
 

 
“I’ll teach you everything you need to know. Do you want me to teach you in a way suitable for a disciple, or do you just want to cover the basics for the sake of the movie? Don’t be afraid and don’t force yourself; just be honest.”
 

 
By the end of it, the master who had nurtured many stars in the film industry looked like a wronged old man.
 

 
Duan Ge echoed something similar to what the wealthy businessman had said:
 

 
“I want the best; just hold me to the highest standards.”
 

 
Duan Ge's thoughts were simple and straightforward.
 

 
Director Deng is recognized as the most formidable figure in Chinese martial arts. It would be foolish to miss out on such a great opportunity to learn. What does hardship matter? Duan Ge’s daily routine is all about enduring hardship, and being able to stay peacefully in the palace of consciousness doesn’t suit her at all. That’s why when Tong Zhao underwent the consciousness test through the Instinct Film Association, she saw Duan Ge’s room piled high with survival resources, cramped and narrow… all remnants of the shadows from her previous experiences in a post-apocalyptic world.
 

 
Director Deng glanced at her: “Don’t force yourself.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ll know if I try.”
 

 
Only then did Director Deng turn to face her properly: “You need to get up at five-thirty every morning.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I can get up at five to make breakfast for you, Master.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this a reverse bargain?
 

 
Director Deng clearly didn’t expect his little disciple to make such a move: “That’s not really necessary…”
 

 
“Respect for my teacher is the right thing to do.”
 

 
Duan Ge has always been very clear about her relationships and is quite perceptive about people.
 

 
Director Deng truly cares for Tong Zhao, showing genuine affection for a promising junior in martial arts.
 

 
“Throw me a peach, I’ll return it with a plum.”
 

 
Director Deng stared at her for a while, suddenly less friendly, as if he didn’t dare to be too happy in advance. He snorted coldly and called the sixth senior brother in to help her choose a room, saying in a gruff voice, “If you’re just going to learn casually, you can stay in a nearby hotel and come over for five hours of class each day. It would be much easier.”
 

 
This expectation mixed with fear of being hurt…
 

 
It was like a girl who had been deceived by ten scumbags; one could see she was becoming more childlike with each passing day.
 

 
This was the first step to treating Tong Zhao like one of their own.
 

 
As Duan Ge stepped forward, she turned back and said, “From early morning to evening, Master, don’t worry about getting tired.”
 

 
Director Deng felt amused and snorted heavily again, secretly resolving to see the results tomorrow.
 

 
He truly intended to bring out the strictness he had shown to his previously accepted disciples and see how long this delicate little girl could hold on!
 

 
……
 

 
The sixth senior brother led Duan Ge to the dormitory area.
 

 
There weren’t many core disciples living in the martial arts academy, and the dormitory areas for female and male disciples were clearly separated. The female disciples were already few, and in recent years, the senior sisters had all moved out due to marriage and childbirth, so Duan Ge basically had the place to herself, even more comfortable than staying in a hotel suite…
 

 
Though it was called a dormitory, it felt more like a quaint resort.
 

 
After all, this place isn’t designed for profit by widely accepting disciples, so there’s no need for large dormitories.
 

 
It’s more like a prestigious mansion that has just a few too many grandchildren.
 

 
After Duan Ge chose her room, the sixth senior brother didn’t go inside due to the separation of the genders: “A cleaner will come every day to tidy up. If you don’t need it, just hang the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign outside the door. Flip it over, and it means ‘Please come in to clean,’” he added, thinking for a moment about what else to say. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in his head, and he comforted her, saying, “Master can be a bit childlike with those close to him, so don’t take it to heart. He treats his disciples very well.”
 

 
“Master said that today you should just get familiar with the environment, and learning will start tomorrow.”
 

 
Duan Ge smiled slightly.
 

 
She could, of course, distinguish between malicious difficulty and playful arrogance.
 

 
“I understand. Since Master arranged everything so thoughtfully, I should be grateful.”
 

 
The sixth senior brother breathed a sigh of relief, and his gaze toward her became even more affectionate.
 

 
At forty years old, with a daughter around Tong Zhao’s age who was off having fun in college, he could only express his paternal love through money transfers. Now, seeing his junior sister felt like looking at his daughter’s classmate, filled with the strange affection of a father.
 

 
His little junior sister was just too cute.
 

 
However, for some reason, after she met with Master, her demeanor suddenly changed.
 

 
She looked a bit fierce.
 

 
Thus, the sixth senior brother unconsciously thought Master had said something wrong, making his little junior sister unhappy—ever since the last time Master had taught a little disciple who couldn’t endure the hardship and ran back home, Master had been quite affected. After all, he could tell that Master genuinely liked that child…
 

 
Master also liked Tong Zhao.
 

 
Did he scare her off with his usual arrogance when they first met? The sixth senior brother sighed inwardly.
 

 
That’s why he offered such comforting words to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Duan Ge, who wasn’t scared at all, thought this environment was simply too good.
 

 
It was comfortable to stay here, and the sect had such pleasant conversations; she liked it here a lot.
 

 
Tong Zhao was truly deep in sleep this time. Unless Zeshan had something urgent to discuss or Sister Chu had official business with her, she didn’t want to be disturbed for anything else. It felt like she was on an extended vacation, resting in her consciousness palace, sorting through her past memories, filling in the gaps, and playing with Zhao Zai…
 

 
“Shouldn’t I be doing something that a female celebrity is supposed to do?”
 

 
Duan Ge turned around in her room.
 

 
Han Zhi gave her a suggestion: “A month of training might be too long. If you want to engage with fans, you could document your little training moments, like filming a Vlog.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Oh, I can tell you’re an old influencer just by the way you speak.”
 

 
Duan Ge asked both Master and Sister Chu for permission to film a Vlog via WeChat.
 

 
Master: “Sure. Deng.”
 

 
Master: “No one’s not around. Deng.”
 

 
According to the sixth senior brother, the “Deng” at the end was Master’s signature.
 

 
Master: “But you need to clarify the main mission of your visit to the martial arts school. Deng. [Muay Thai warning. (Panda head punching) gif]”
 

 
……
 

 
How should she put it……
 

 
Did she need to explain that the Muay Thai warning wasn’t used in that way?
 

 
But it didn’t seem wrong either.
 

 
The internal struggle between being fashionable and retro was definitely a reflection of Master himself.
 

 
After receiving approval, Duan Ge began filming her Vlog with Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
After filming for three minutes, Han Zhi couldn’t take it anymore: “Can I do it instead? I’m better at this.”
 

 
Duan Ge scratched her head and stepped aside.
 

 
When it came to filming, Shuyi and Han Zhi were the best.
 

 
However, once Shuyi started talking, her tone became strange: “Martial arts is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese nation. As time goes by, this ancient culture is gradually fading away… If we’re talking about the place where martial arts traditions are preserved the best, we cannot bypass the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center and Master Deng. Today, as a student, I have come to the martial arts center…”
 

 
In short, the documentary felt overly intense and not very feminine.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t used to being feminine; after stretching a bit in front of the full-length mirror, he started filming.
 

 
After putting on the mask, Han Zhi ran to the entrance of the center, re-recording some footage and editing the process of Tong Zhao arriving at the center.
 

 
Without a smartphone stabilizer, it was still a bit difficult to film.
 

 
The first night at the martial arts school was spent filming and editing with Han Zhi.
 

 
……
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
Arrived at the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center in the afternoon.
 

 
Little junior sister is all set!
 

 
PS: This trip doesn’t have an assistant following me; this Vlog was filmed while learning, so please bear with me.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t need to learn anything.
 

 
Doing this made him appear even more diligent.
 

 
This kind of self-promotion was his occupational habit; he did it effortlessly.
 

 
Under Tong Zhao’s Weibo, many fans were eagerly waiting for updates.
 

 
As soon as this new post came out, the number of comments visibly shot up from 0 to three digits, and after refreshing, it hit four digits.
 

 
The growth rate was comparable to real estate prices.
 

 
You just think about how to be clever, and suddenly, the front row turns into the back row.
 

 
The video wasn’t long, just five minutes, briefly introducing the martial arts school and her living arrangements.
 

 
Han Zhi had a strong sense of the camera, making the short video feel like a professional promotional film; once the filter was applied, the fans couldn’t believe their sister had filmed it.
 

 
[Your sister did such a great job! So talented and versatile!]
 

 
[Already at the location? Are you going to train for a month? Sounds tough…]
 

 
[Even during the traditional film era, your sister must have been a particularly hard-working actress.]
 

 
Originally, it was just meant to be filmed for promotion, but unexpectedly, after Shi Dingjun saw it, he contacted her via WeChat and asked if she would be interested in turning the month-long training into a video. He had always wanted to shoot some short clips to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center but had never found a good opportunity. Today, seeing her film the martial arts school in such a relatable way, he knew it could definitely appeal to a younger audience.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “I’m not looking to profit from this; I just want more young people to know about our martial arts school.”
 

 
Shi Dingjun: “If you’re willing, I can arrange for a photographer from my team to come and assist you in filming the videos.”
 

 
……
 

 
Han Zhi, who really just wanted to do some promotion: "..."
 

 
Thinking about it, it didn't seem like a bad idea!
# Chapter85
Han Zhi agreed to it.
 

 
Shi Dingjun was very efficient and sent the photographer that same evening.
 

 
According to him, Xuanxuan was a particularly hardworking girl, and it was fine to let her sleep on a folding bed. This wasn’t meant to be harsh; if she was going to follow Tong Zhao around for 24 hours for filming, it would be more convenient for them to share a room. Finding a female photographer was also for this reason.
 

 
Xuanxuan was very willing.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t want to impose on the girl like this, so he went to discuss adding a bed in the room with Sixth Senior Brother. Since the suite provided for the junior sister was quite large, having one more person wouldn’t make it feel cramped.
 

 
Han Zhi: “If it’s going to be 24-hour filming, then I can’t do it. Duan Ge, you come back.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Okay.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “By the way, are the class hours split evenly between me and Shuyi? Who goes first?”
 

 
For a full 24 hours, the two personalities would be divided.
 

 
Shuyi: “You go first.”
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why so polite with me?”
 

 
Shuyi: “I just don’t want to get up early…”
 

 
With this simple statement about not wanting to wake up early, the conversation suddenly felt more real.
 

 
Before Han Zhi left the main personality position, he discussed filming ideas with the photographer, Xuanxuan, for half an hour. After reaching a consensus, he let Duan Ge take back control of the body. She stretched her neck a bit and heard Xuanxuan excitedly ask, “By the way, I need to film you getting up every day, so I’ll need to wake up earlier than you. What time does Sister Zhao plan to wake up?”
 

 
Her smile was full of excitement, with a rosy glow on her fair cheeks.
 

 
Oh my.
 

 
She was going to film Tong Zhao!
 

 
That was almost on the same level as the treatment given to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xuanxuan's lips curl up uncontrollably.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Five o’clock.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Xuanxuan’s smile suddenly faltered.
 

 
Xuanxuan: “Is, is it really that early...?”
 

 
“Yeah, I’ll get up early to make breakfast,” Duan Ge asked with concern, “Can you not make it?”
 

 
Thinking she might be replaced, Xuanxuan quickly shook her head.
 

 
"I can get up, don’t worry, it’s no problem at all!"
 

 
Duan Ge gave a light "mm" in response: “Get some rest early tonight.”
 

 
During the apocalypse, entertainment was almost nonexistent. Physical books were unexpectedly precious; later, her survival base found a large number of books in a warehouse—most likely from a bookstore’s storage. Those books became something her subordinates eagerly borrowed. Therefore, Duan Ge had a low demand for entertainment and had long since given up the habit of using it, even in harsh environments.
 

 
At ten o’clock that night, when Xuanxuan still wanted to play on her phone for a while, she saw that Duan Ge had already covered herself with a blanket.
 

 
From her calm and steady breathing, it seemed she had fallen asleep.
 

 
…What a disciplined modern woman!
 

 
How could a modern person go to bed at ten o'clock without playing on their phone at all!
 

 
So impressive.
 

 
Of course, Xuanxuan already knew that Tong Zhao was very talented, but seeing her go to bed and fall asleep in seconds at ten o'clock made Xuanxuan's admiration rise to another level. Observing Tong Zhao's discipline, she felt embarrassed to continue playing on her phone. She obediently set a vibrating alarm for four-thirty and turned off her screen to sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
At four-thirty, Xuanxuan was jolted awake by the phone vibrating under her pillow for a second and quickly pressed the snooze button.
 

 
Once she shook off the grogginess of just waking up, a sense of accomplishment spread across her face.
 

 
She was up!
 

 
Fortunately, she had seen Sister Zhao go to sleep early last night, so she also seized the opportunity to rest. Otherwise, waking up this early would have been unbearable. Xuanxuan tiptoed out of bed and unexpectedly locked eyes with Duan Ge, who had already sat up in bed: "..."
 

 
Unlike her groggy, dazed expression, Duan Ge looked awake, her complexion slightly pale but her eyes bright and alert.
 

 
Wait, she had only just woken up a few seconds ago!
 

 
Duan Ge: “I’ve noticed a problem.”
 

 
Xuanxuan stared at her blankly: “What is it, Sister Zhao?”
 

 
Duan Ge continued: “I’m the type who wakes up at the slightest sound of life nearby, so you won’t be able to capture me waking up to the alarm because I’ll be fully awake by the time you’re about ten steps away.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
The photographer was even more dumbfounded.
 

 
She had considered many obstacles to filming, like a big star throwing a tantrum, and last night she had even been secretly relieved that Sister Zhao was easy to get along with and had specially arranged a large bed for her. She never expected that difficulties were waiting for her. She blurted out, “W-why is that?”
 

 
Duan Ge paused for a moment, omitting the cause and only stating the result: “When a person is sleeping, they are usually unguarded, right? I just feel it’s dangerous. Even if I try to convince myself that you’re not a threat, I will still wake up… it’s instinct.”
 

 
As the photographer considered probing further, she recalled the family scandal that had come to light about Sister Zhao.
 

 
She heard that Sister Zhao’s father was an abusive scumbag!
 

 
Growing up in such a cold and brutal family, it was only natural that her instincts would be sharper than most people’s. The photographer felt a surge of sympathy.
 

 
Not revealing someone’s scars is the most basic courtesy, so she immediately suppressed her inappropriate curiosity and quickly came to an understanding: “Okay, then can you lie back down and pretend to be asleep? I’ll get everything ready, and when your alarm goes off, you can pretend to wake up then.”
 

 
That was easy enough to do.
 

 
Duan Ge nodded and lay back down.
 

 
Startled by Sister Zhao, the photographer’s sleepiness vanished completely. She hurried to wash her face, brush her teeth, and change into comfortable clothes. Once she got the camera ready, she said, “I’m starting to film in three seconds.”
 

 
At five in the morning, it was still dark outside.
 

 
The alarm rang, and the bedside lamp gradually lit up. Duan Ge, who had been wide awake for a while, sat up in bed. The light from the bedside lamp cast a warm glow over her pale skin, making her look like the heroine in an art film. The photographer instantly understood why the famous director liked to film her so much—Shi Qianqiu was also notoriously picky about aesthetics on camera and had won many photography awards during college.
 

 
Even with no makeup, Sister Zhao looked beautiful!
 

 
Duan Ge looked at the camera and said in a hoarse voice, “Can you step outside and wait for me? I need to change clothes.”
 

 
The photographer quickly nodded and stepped outside.
 

 
She had mentally prepared herself for a long wait, but unexpectedly, within ten minutes, Duan Ge came out fully dressed.
 

 
Most people, after getting up and taking a morning shower, tend to daze off in the hot water, but Duan Ge wasn’t accustomed to that. She was very disciplined, taking what she called a “standard three-minute combat shower.” Afterward, she applied skincare products to her skin based on memory, using serums and moisturizers, all while getting dressed and doing her light makeup, resembling a well-trained robot.
 

 
The weather had turned a bit cold recently, with even lower temperatures in the morning.
 

 
From the photographer's perspective, Sister Zhao appeared in a black long-sleeve sports outfit, her hair tied in a high ponytail… Before coming to Qin City, her stylist had curled her hair, and now her ponytail had a graceful wave that softened the sharpness of her bangs that were all slicked back. She wore very light makeup; her long eyebrows framed her softly hazel eyes, which seemed to hold a distant, misty look.
 

 
Her fair skin glowed against the morning chill, giving her an air of cool detachment that left the photographer mesmerized.
 

 
“Let’s go.”
 

 
Duan Ge lifted her chin toward the photographer and walked straight ahead.
 

 
It was only then that the photographer, still taken aback by her understated beauty, snapped back to reality and quickly nodded to follow her.
 

 
Last night, Duan Ge had asked her sixth senior brother about Master’s meal arrangements.
 

 
The sixth senior brother said that everyone in the martial arts school ate in a common dining hall, and Master was no exception.
 

 
When the Master’s wife was in good health, she used to eat with him, but her health had deteriorated over the years. After forcing herself to attend Master’s sixtieth birthday banquet, she returned to the nursing home. Master was willing to take care of her, but given her condition required constant medical attention, it was inappropriate for her to stay at the martial arts school.
 

 
After learning about Master’s dietary preferences and restrictions, Duan Ge went to the kitchen to make chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles. She also made a cup of soy milk and prepared two meat buns from the kitchen. Since she had gone to bed early last night, she could have prepared more simple dishes beforehand, making it easy to get breakfast ready in the morning.
 

 
As for herself, she simply took some meat buns and plain porridge from the kitchen.
 

 
The photographer also grabbed some to eat.
 

 
The meat buns were stuffed generously with filling, and the juices soaked through the bun skin, making them particularly delicious.
 

 
Duan Ge lost count of how many she had eaten; she just continued until she was full.
 

 
…
 

 
After yesterday's meal with Tong Zhao, Director Deng had completely forgotten about her plan to wake up early to make breakfast for Master.
 

 
How could she possibly wake up on time?
 

 
He heard that Xiao Jun had arranged for her to have a photographer, hoping to get her up in the morning.
 

 
Director Deng didn’t think much of it and continued with his usual morning routine. Just as he was preparing to go to the dining hall for breakfast, the doorbell rang.
 

 
So early, who could it be?
 

 
A flicker of anticipation rose in Director Deng’s heart but was quickly suppressed.
 

 
“Who is it?”
 

 
He asked loudly while opening the door.
 

 
Behind the door stood his young disciple.
 

 
“Master, breakfast is ready.”
 

 
In an instant, Director Deng felt as if he had returned to twenty years ago...
 

 
Back then, the disciples he took in all adhered to such rules, doing everything they could to please their master.
 

 
As he grew older, he lost the desire to take on students.
 

 
The last time he accepted a disciple was ten years ago, and that experience had been quite dismal, almost like a reminder that his way of teaching was no longer in vogue.
 

 
Granddisciples were not as rewarding to instruct.
 

 
Director Deng had a bit of a craving to take in disciples again.
 

 
Seeing Duan Ge standing there, enveloped in the cold morning air, made Director Deng’s heart soften immensely.
 

 
The feeling was akin to that of a player in many online games who, after completing a system task, is given a disciple, only to be touched and embarrassed when the disciple presents them with thoughtful little herbal dishes or other items.
 

 
“Did you really go and get me breakfast? You didn’t need to go to all this trouble. What time did you wake up?”
 

 
Despite his effort to appear dismissive, the joy on Director Deng’s face was unmistakable as he accepted the tray. “Come in quickly. After I finish breakfast, we’ll head to the morning class—although the lesson is tailored to your performance needs, it’s a rare opportunity for the other disciples, so those interested will join in to learn. If anyone isn’t focused on martial arts, I’ll send them back to the second and third halls.”
 

 
The martial arts practice spaces were mostly spacious indoor areas.
 

 
The second and third halls were where ordinary disciples attended classes; the first hall was reserved for when Director Deng taught his disciples. Even though it had been years since he had needed it, he was reluctant to let anyone else use it, saying they could do as they pleased once he passed on.
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t hold back and walked in with the photographer.
 

 
Han Zhi: “I just realized that Director Shi sending a photographer over is incredibly timely.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “Hmm? How so?”
 

 
Shuyi: “With a month of one-on-one instruction, although Master is in his sixties, there could still be malicious speculation… Having a photographer present at all times can help extinguish any potential misunderstandings.”
 

 
After hearing their analysis, Duan Ge realized this aspect as well.
 

 
She could certainly sense Director Deng’s fondness for her; it was the affection an elder shows to a junior. However, many people would gladly wish for Tong Zhao’s downfall.
 

 
Duan Ge: “I need to gather evidence in advance for things I haven’t done.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, "This is exactly the kind of thing celebrities have to worry about for a lifetime. You wouldn’t believe how much reporters want you to get into trouble."
 

 
Director Deng finished his breakfast quickly.
 

 
After eating, he frowned, sensing something was off.
 

 
He had been eating the cafeteria chef's dishes for over ten years, and aside from the meat buns being at a familiar level, the chive and egg pancakes and soy sauce noodles were typical Chinese breakfast items. However, as he ate, he noticed they tasted different from usual—much better than normal. The highlight was the soy sauce noodles, topped with a savory sauce made from diced pork stir-fried with seasonings. It was incredibly satisfying.
 

 
At that moment, Director Deng thought that Duan Ge had simply brought him the cafeteria's dishes.
 

 
Just this gesture was already enough to touch the master.
 

 
Director Deng ate quickly and then led her to a classroom.
 

 
The other disciples who had come to learn were sitting quietly in the corner, not daring to look too much.
 

 
After all, they were all young men in their prime, and Tong Zhao was a well-known beauty in the entertainment industry. They were afraid of embarrassing themselves by staring at her, and they certainly didn’t want to give the junior sister a bad impression of the sect, making her think that all the disciples were lecherous. So, before they arrived, they were sternly reminded to keep their focus on learning. If they were caught behaving inappropriately in front of their senior aunt, they would be sent back to the second and third halls and reprimanded!
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was personally taken in by Master Deng, she ranked higher in seniority than these disciples.
 

 
They should call her "Senior Aunt."
 

 
As soon as Director Deng entered the room, he waved for the boys to come over and greet her as "Senior Aunt."
 

 
So, under the watchful eyes of the camera and Duan Ge...
 

 
These boys, afraid of losing their resolve and being distracted by her beauty, kept their heads down, showing only their black hair as they took turns saying, "Good day, Master Deng! Good day, Senior Aunt!"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s persona didn’t have low emotional intelligence.
 

 
After all, this was one of her core traits.
 

 
Duan Ge was no exception; she could sense that these younger disciples were not entirely convinced about calling her "Senior Aunt," but under the authority of Master Deng, they had to comply.
 

 
Duan Ge raised an eyebrow.
 

 
Consort Chen: “One-on-one combat, smash them!”
 

 
Duan Ge: “I really suspect your palace intrigue skills refer to physical combat.”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied: “I’ve beaten my fair share of provocateurs, but I’d rather not dirty my hands myself; my hands are too delicate. Why not let the maids and eunuchs deal with it? Everyone has their specialties.” She said the most arrogant things in the sweetest tone.
 

 
The photographer was relieved to find that once she set up the camera, she could sit to the side and take a quick rest.
 

 
If nothing special happens, then she will just consider it a chance to catch up on sleep.
 

 
With her eyes closed, she doesn't love anyone!
 

 
Once the photographer set up the camera and got everything ready, she was so tired that her single eyelid looked like a double eyelid. She couldn’t help but sneak a glance at Duan Ge.
 

 
As a result, she found Duan Ge full of energy, doing warm-up exercises.
 

 
The photographer was speechless; indeed, one’s physical condition varies from person to person!
 

 
…
 

 
Having learned from the last time he took on a disciple, Director Deng didn’t dare to have too high expectations for Tong Zhao at the beginning. He started by teaching her the basics.
 

 
He not only taught her martial arts moves but also explained the meaning behind each technique.
 

 
Seeing that Tong Zhao was listening intently, Director Deng felt reassured that he hadn’t misjudged her.
 

 
Because Director Deng was taking it easy, the other disciples found his class much less demanding than their usual lessons with their own master. Is this really the stern Master Deng they had heard about? It wasn't until Director Deng noticed that Tong Zhao was able to learn everything quickly that he gradually began to raise his expectations.
 

 
A week passed, and the other disciples began to struggle. They went to their master to say that the pace was too fast and requested that he give feedback to Master Deng to slow it down a bit.
 

 
Their master replied, "There’s nothing I can do. This was originally a private lesson for Tong Zhao. How much you learn is your own fortune; as long as she keeps up, Master Deng has no reason to slow down the teaching pace for you."
 

 
That made sense.
 

 
However, the other disciples were skeptical: had Tong Zhao really learned everything?
 

 
They all thought it was too fast; didn’t Tong Zhao feel the same way?
 

 
So someone went to ask her.
 

 
During a break, Director Deng was not far away and perked up his ears when he heard this question.
 

 
Duan Ge was leisurely drinking water, replying, "It’s not fast; I think it’s just right."
 

 
The disciples were not convinced and didn’t believe she had really learned everything and found it just right. "Senior Aunt, don’t force yourself. It’s better to master one set before moving on to the next; you can’t bite off more than you can chew."
 

 
"I’m not forcing myself,"
 

 
Duan Ge finished her bottled water with a few hearty gulps, her beautiful eyes casually scanning the speaker. "Don’t believe me? Want to go one-on-one? Only with the techniques I’ve learned."
 

 
If there weren’t any pre-set restrictions, her fighting style would feel more streetwise.
 

 
Since it was a rare opportunity for "reviewing the old and learning the new," of course, it was best to use the techniques she had just learned!
 

 
The disciple clearly hadn’t expected the celebrity to propose a one-on-one match, and a look of disbelief crossed his face, as if to say, "Are you kidding me?" However, Duan Ge’s challenge was laid out before him, and backing down would be even more embarrassing. The martial arts school allowed disciples to spar with each other, so he had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree.
 

 
He turned back to discuss with the other disciples how they could go easy on her.
 

 
In his thoughts, he quickly imagined the moment he would be pinned to the ground by Duan Ge during the sparring match.
 

 
The dilemma of how to go easy on her turned into thoughts of how to defeat her.
 

 
Duan Ge stood tall, her expression still calm and composed.
 

 
There was a hint of restraint within her solitude.
 

 
It was genuinely hard to suppress her laughter.
 

 
Throughout the sparring match, her mind was filled with thoughts like…
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fight well, and hit harder! Show him he shouldn’t underestimate you!"
 

 
Shuyi: "Make it hurt a bit; I don’t want anyone else coming to challenge me when I’m on duty."
 

 
Duan Ge had become the golden fighter of Tong Zhao's personality.
 

 
For her, the hardest part was actually holding back her laughter during the match.
 

 
Just a moment ago, she couldn’t help but smile.
 

 
The defeated disciple A took a long time to regain his senses.
 

 
At one point, when his attack was countered and he was taken down, he caught a close-up glimpse of the slight curve of Duan Ge’s lips, as if she was trying hard to suppress something… Was it? Yes, she had numerous opportunities to deliver a lethal blow, and that was clearly a smile indicating the restraint of lethal intent!
 

 
Realizing this, disciple A felt a chill run down his spine. Once he managed to scramble to his feet, he cupped his fists and said, "Senior Aunt, you’re amazing! I willingly concede!"
 

 
The other disciples were skeptical, thinking he had gone too easy and messed up.
 

 
Naturally, a second disciple came forward to seek guidance.
 

 
Duan Ge felt it was a bit unfair—after all, she had a body cultivated through the way of immortals, where martial arts and spiritual practice were inseparable. Besides, she had far more experience in one-on-one combat than these young men, who were used to sparring with strict rules of martial ethics at the school. To put it bluntly, she knew exactly where to hit to make her opponent momentarily powerless, and her mindset was calm, confident, and free of fear. She possessed all the ideal traits of a martial artist.
 

 
But so what if it felt unfair?
 

 
The satisfaction of winning one after another was simply too exhilarating!
 

 
It only took one sparring match for them to go from casually calling her "Senior Aunt" to genuinely respecting her as their mentor.
 

 
A month passed quickly.
 

 
During this not too long or too short period of time together, the photographer had completely turned into a fan of Tong Zhao. Anyone who lived with her and wanted to improve while often procrastinating would be infected by her unrelenting drive and action. When the photographer excitedly took the footage back to edit, Tong Zhao also woke up from her holiday and returned to her original city, diving into a series of promotional appearances.
 

 
She appeared on an interview program and a traditional variety show themed around ancient cuisine.
 

 
In this variety show, guests were required to wear ancient costumes.
 

 
This provided an opportunity for Consort Chen to perform—
 

 
In fact, Tong Zhao initially planned to do it herself, but when Consort Chen playfully said she wanted to join in, Tong Zhao agreed!
 

 
Whatever she wanted to do, pampering herself was the priority.
 

 
On the variety show, Consort Chen radiated an aura that outshone everyone else. The combined effect of the system's aura and her own enchanting presence created a multiplier effect that was far more than just 1 + 1.
 

 
As a result, the other female guests were completely overshadowed.
 

 
It wasn’t that the production team didn’t film them; they did, but their discussions were quickly overshadowed.
 

 
Some female guests were relieved that Tong Zhao was only appearing for one episode, thinking that they would be fine once that was over.
 

 
However, others couldn’t sit still.
# Chapter86
"Breaking News! Tong Zhao and Rumored Boyfriend Spotted in Qin City: Is It Fake Studying or Real Affair?"
 

 
"Mr. Wei's Green Hat: Is the Truth Really Like This?"
 

 
"Tong Zhao and Handsome Guy Caught in Flirty Interaction on the Streets: Fans Shocked and Disappointed"
 

 
The reporter who captured these photos made a tidy sum on the side.
 

 
Why was this only revealed now?
 

 
Because they were negotiating the price.
 

 
In this batch of photos, Tong Zhao, wearing a mask, was seen walking down the street with a tall man in black sportswear before they got into a car. There wasn't any ambiguous behavior; they didn't kiss or hold hands, so the photos weren't particularly valuable, and the entertainment media were reluctant to pay a high price for them. However, the reporter believed they should be worth more.
 

 
Since the price didn’t meet their expectations, the reporter preferred to keep them under wraps. After all, the reporter didn’t dislike Tong Zhao and even liked her movies.
 

 
It wasn't until Tong Zhao finished her closed-door training and appeared on "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat"...
 

 
Things unexpectedly got messy.
 

 
The timeline needs to be pushed back two days—
 

 
There was a co-star on the same show, actress Ning Siya, who had a tranquil demeanor and a deep understanding of ancient cuisine. She had recently gained some popularity with a light idol drama, "Palm-sized Preserved Fruits," which revolved around ancient food. Both her manager and she thought that "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" would be a great variety show choice for her.
 

 
Think about it: fans who loved her for the ancient culinary drama would see her in a similar-themed variety show and find her character very relatable, leading to increased affection for her. The interest generated by the variety show would also reflect positively on her drama, creating a virtuous cycle.
 

 
But the problem was that Tong Zhao was also on the same show.
 

 
During the costume change segment, Ning Siya chose a light yellow ancient dress. Another female guest asked her if she didn’t prefer wearing white. She replied, “In most dynasties, white is considered an unlucky mourning color. Although I really like the clean and unblemished look of white, I still have to remember the traditions of our ancestors.”
 

 
Because they were going to shoot in a resort themed like an ancient palace, this statement didn’t seem unreasonable. It painted the image of a cultured girl who valued traditions. However, another female guest, who wasn’t very educated, was nervously clutching a white outfit she apparently intended to wear. After hearing this, she awkwardly smiled and put the dress back.
 

 
Seeing this, Ning Siya also smiled and said, “If you have any questions about the rules, feel free to ask me. But I’m just an amateur; I’m only interested in this aspect.”
 

 
…At that moment, Consort Chen, dressed in a gown styled like a dragon robe, walked over and curiously asked, “According to the traditions, shouldn’t one kneel when seeing someone in a dragon robe?”
 

 
Ning Siya froze on the spot.
 

 
Seeing her not respond, Consort Chen finished her smile and went off to talk to someone else.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t entirely an “ancient person.” After all, from the beginning in the ancient world, Tong Zhao had known she was on a quick transmigration mission. It was her belief in “my fate is in my own hands, not dictated by heaven” and the spirit of “how can princes and nobles have more power than me?” that allowed her to break through many crises in unconventional ways. However, spending so long in that world—almost a lifetime—had formed her into a distinct personality.
 

 
So, when Consort Chen had the choice to wear what she liked, she unhesitatingly chose the audacious style of a dragon robe dress.
 

 
If the emperor could wear it, then so could she.
 

 
In fact, there was a time when she accidentally spilled tea, and the liquid soaked her foot; she even stepped on the emperor’s dragon robe to dry it off. What’s the big deal? She wore what she wanted and enjoyed herself. How could she uphold the title of Consort without being a little willful?
 

 
At that moment, Ning Siya was arranged to sit next to Tong Zhao, her beautiful face adorned with a gentle smile, presenting an ethereal, unworldly appearance.
 

 
Many people admired her style.
 

 
Elegant and serene, she resembled a fairy who had strayed into the mortal world.
 

 
But the problem was, sitting beside her was Consort Chen, radiating an overwhelming presence.
 

 
Bright yellow was already an eye-catching color, overshadowing Ning Siya, who wore a light yellow dress—did she prefer subtlety? Then she might as well embrace it.
 

 
There seemed to be no chance for her to shine brightly.
 

 
Consort Chen wasn’t targeting her specifically.
 

 
It was just that, as a favored Consort, she had developed the habit of wanting to stand out. Hiding her brilliance and playing second fiddle was impossible for her.
 

 
The theme of "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" was about modernized ancient cuisine, featuring segments where guests sampled food and also prepared simple dishes together. During the cooking segment, Consort Chen was clumsy and wanted to quit after a while. However, she forced herself to complete it, thinking of impressing Zhao Zhao on the show. It was quite humbling for her—this princess personally washing her hands to make soup; she definitely had to make Zhao Zhao happy afterward.
 

 
In this round, Ning Siya shone more brightly, but during the food tasting segment, all the attention was snatched by Consort Chen.
 

 
Even if one ingredient was of lesser quality, every dish prepared with care…
 

 
Consort Chen could discern every flavor; nothing escaped her taste buds.
 

 
The comments ranged from those criticizing her for being spoiled to others recognizing that she actually had a deep understanding and appreciation for ancient cuisine, just lacking in practical skills, which suited her role as a concubine.
 

 
Tong Zhao's portrayal of the concubine had resonated well with the audience.
 

 
After all, a concubine should be a bit pampered.
 

 
Moreover, her previous appearances on "72 Hours" and "One Life Survivor" proved she could endure hardship and withstand tough challenges, while being a little lazy and picky in peacetime was merely endearing.
 

 
Some viewers, holding onto the fantasy that "celebrities should be flawless," relentlessly criticized Tong Zhao in the comments.
 

 
[It’s puzzling—how can someone who can only eat but not cook be a cute point?]
 

 
[I think she just doesn’t want to work.]
 

 
This statement had some truth to it.
 

 
Consort Chen really didn’t want to work.
 

 
[Are we really saying Tong Zhao is lazy after just one episode????]
 

 
[Come on, this is just a light-hearted variety show; the guests are here to eat, drink, and have fun. Would you get scolded for not having the correct posture while farming at a homestay? Besides, Tong Zhao has always been quite capable in the kitchen. She just came out of closed-door training and only wants to eat, so what's wrong with that? Are you eating her rice?]
 

 
With this part of the criticism, the controversy surrounding Tong Zhao boosted the discussion of this episode of the variety show.
 

 
Of course, just eating and being picky can be off-putting, but Consort Chen also had her likable traits.
 

 
She sincerely praised the well-prepared dishes, noticing details that other guests missed:
 

 
“The broth is a bit bland. Adding vinegar would ruin the chef’s carefully crafted sweetness. If only we had Jinhua ham juice!”
 

 
When asked about a dish that had a texture similar to fish belly and fish maw, she was able to elaborate: “This is the tendon from the back of the sturgeon; it tastes like fish belly but has more bounce.”
 

 
However, she absolutely refused to eat fish with a muddy taste.
 

 
The comments playfully remarked that they had invited a serious emperor:
 

 
[Tong Zhao in a dragon robe is practically the emperor himself, aside from gender.]
 

 
[How about a gender-swapped version of "The Legend of Ming Emperor"? I’d definitely watch! I want to see Zhao Zhao as the female emperor!]
 

 
[No, no, no, she doesn’t have the taste of someone who commands the world. She’s better suited to play a foolish ruler who should be fed grapes by beautiful women, doing nothing but enjoying food and fun every day.]
 

 
Screenshots of Tong Zhao's beauty on the variety show were referred to as depictions of a pampered concubine donning a dragon robe.
 

 
#PamperedConcubineBigBoldTongZhao#
 

 
This trending topic was filled with Tong Zhao's expressive memes.
 

 
When she tasted a piece of fish with a slight fishy smell that the other guests didn’t notice, [Tong Zhao looked disdainful.jpg], her spoiled attitude was entirely justified. There was also the moment when someone asked Ning Siyu if she should kneel before the dragon robe, [Tong Zhao looked puzzled.jpg]... Whatever is fun, let’s go with it. Others might not know, but Song Wanzhuo had a whole collection of these memes in her WeChat and secretly gave a thumbs-up to the production team.
 

 
Half of the money behind this trending topic came from the "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" variety show team.
 

 
It wasn't because they were enchanted by Tong Zhao's charm.
 

 
It was simply because she was the most discussed point of this episode; the backend data clearly indicated it, and the show just went along to ride the wave of her popularity. While others joined the variety show to gain exposure, Tong Zhao’s presence ended up giving the show a boost in heat!
 

 
No one making a variety show would pass up the chance to invite Tong Zhao.
 

 
She always delivered unexpected results; for example, "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" had steady but mediocre ratings. As soon as she appeared, the ratings skyrocketed. It was completely worth the high price they paid to have her on.
 

 
The outcome was that no one was talking about Ning Siyu; her appearance was practically meaningless.
 

 
What angered Ning Siyu the most was seeing people who initially tuned in to watch "Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat" for her end up being captivated by Tong Zhao. Her manager comforted her, saying that because of Tong Zhao, this second-tier variety show had jumped to first-tier ratings, giving her higher exposure than before...
 

 
This consolation was worse than useless; Ning Siyu was furious!
 

 
Then there was that part where they asked her if she should kneel upon seeing the dragon robe, and the trolls were criticizing her for pretending and ruining her image. Of course, her elders, who had worked hard to liberate China with blood and tears, could wear whatever they wanted. How could she take other guests' advice on what to wear, using “the rules of our ancestors” to point fingers at them? Did she really think she was a cultured matriarch?
 

 
Ning Siyu felt that these people were just Tong Zhao's fans, coming to annoy her.
 

 
However, in reality, these trolls were simultaneously criticizing Consort Chen for being lazy, picky, and spoiled, merely behaving like typical trolls.
 

 
She really wanted to vent her frustration!
 

 
It was too easy for people in the industry to find dirt on others. Just a hint, and sellers would come looking for her.
 

 
Ning Siyu thought to herself that it was just the cost of three bags, and at worst, she could just act cute with her sugar daddy.
 

 
She bought bags for face value, and now Tong Zhao had made her lose face; venting her anger took priority over buying bags. She quickly arranged for the paparazzi to get a scoop... The reporter took the money and then sold it to the media for a cheaper price.
 

 
After all, Ning Siyu wanted him to expose Tong Zhao, and she never said he couldn’t make a second profit.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was more popular than her, she was confident this would hurt her!
 

 
...
 

 
Her manager asked Tong Zhao if she had any idea who she had offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao was just about to say no.
 

 
Consort Chen: [It must be that person sitting next to me with that gloomy face the whole time.]
 

 
Tong Zhao paused for a moment and asked, “How did you know about this?”
 

 
Consort Chen replied, “I’m very sensitive to malice coming from the same gender.”
 

 
Truly a master of palace intrigue.
 

 
Since she didn’t respond, Sister Chu continued, “But it doesn’t matter. Who did it isn’t important; everyone wants to bring you down or ride your coattails. There’s really nothing to gain from this; it’s mostly just paparazzi snapping random shots.”
 

 
That reasoning was quite reasonable.
 

 
It was enough to consider all competitors as potential enemies; Tong Zhao never thought about making friends in the industry... The entertainment world was essentially a super-large corporation. For adults to genuinely want to befriend colleagues was naive and unnecessary. Of course, there are examples of true friendships, but more often than not, there are incompatible plastic friends, backstabbers competing for promotions, and those you think are friends but turn out to treat you as merely a colleague before quietly leaving, disappearing into the crowd.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao didn’t take the Ning family’s actions to heart, nor would she blame Consort Chen for drawing attention and attracting enemies.
 

 
Tong Zhao praised her, “If you can make people hate you, it seems our princess is doing quite well.”
 

 
Consort Chen responded, “It’s manageable.”
 

 
Sister Chu added, “Now Tong Zhao has the persona tag of being lazy and picky; how do you explain that?”
 

 
Consort Chen confidently replied, “That just means our Zhao Zhao is living well enough to be picky while being lazy.”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh.
 

 
Her manager was baffled by her laughter and asked if she had lost her mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “Of course not! It was my Fourth Senior Brother’s disciple who got photographed. That day, my master suddenly wanted to eat stinky tofu and oil lamp drum from the market, and I had already drunk two cups of my master’s homemade wine in the morning, so I couldn’t drive. I asked my nephew to take me to buy it; it was all out of kindness.”
 

 
If some baseless gossip and unfounded malice could affect Tong Zhao's mindset...
 

 
Then she shouldn’t be in the entertainment industry and should just pack up and return to business.
 

 
Sister Chu understood and decided to come up with a public relations strategy to let Tong Zhao relax for a couple of days.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt completely at ease, but someone else couldn’t sit still.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked when he saw these reports and photos while surfing the internet. No matter who asked him, he claimed he didn’t know anything about it. How could he be greened if they weren’t even together? It must be that damn paparazzi fabricating stories about his good buddy again! Wei Zekai noticed that Tong Zhao hadn’t mentioned the matter at all, and he felt too shy to ask.
 

 
If he were to ask, wouldn’t it make him seem no different from any other netizen?
 

 
To bring up some baseless rumors and gossip with her?
 

 
This is really outrageous.
 

 
But that night, as he tossed and turned, unable to sleep, Wei Zekai finally couldn’t hold back anymore and secretly sent her a message on WeChat: “Have you started dating?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “[So love will disappear, right.jpg]”
 

 
After sending it, he thought it sounded too feminine and quickly added a masculine crying cat emoji.
 

 
Good, that’s the kind of emoji a tough guy should use!
 

 
At that time, Tong Zhao was fast asleep, with her body being played with by Consort Chen.
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: “Don’t browse through her phone.”
 

 
Consort Chen: “But this is my phone too! Ah, it’s just so bitter to think about it. Back then, when I time-traveled to this backward ancient era, I couldn’t even play with my phone. The biggest entertainment was listening to music. It was even more amusing to watch other concubines perform monkey tricks after entering the palace.”
 

 
That makes sense.
 

 
Even if they have different names, they are essentially the same individual.
 

 
Consort Chen wanted to tease Wei Zekai; she had a good impression of him.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were left to her own devices, it would probably be forty years before anything happened.
 

 
Now, let’s shift the camera to the WeChat page on the phone—
 

 
Tong Zhao: “What, are you very interested in my love life?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I’m not here to gossip.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Then tell me, what did you think when you saw those reports?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “I was really angry that they made up stories, but I’m also a bit afraid they might be true.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “If it’s true, and you didn’t tell me about such a big thing as starting a relationship, I’d wonder if you don’t see me as a brother anymore, or if I’m the only one who thinks of you as a really important friend.”
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen: “Damn it, what an idiot.”
 

 
Consort Chen threw the phone onto the bed and directly slipped back into her consciousness palace to sleep.
 

 
As for the boy who was eagerly waiting for a response…
 

 
Why should she care about a man’s thoughts? The beautiful woman was puzzled.
 

 
So, when Tong Zhao woke up and checked her phone, she realized she had left Wei Zekai hanging for an entire night.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought he had said something wrong and, feeling aggrieved, apologized to her. Unable to think of a way to cheer her up, he secretly logged into her game account and sent her a screenshot of his eight consecutive victories.
 

 
How should I put it? The thought process of a gamer is quite peculiar.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Fake.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If I were dating someone, I would tell you right away.”
 

 
When Wei Zekai woke up and saw her reply, he felt relieved but also strangely dissatisfied.
 

 
Just as the reporter had thought, those photos didn’t elicit much of a reaction from the fans.
 

 
So what if she was dating?
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t peddling the illusion of romance. Some fans even hoped for fewer boyfriend fans, and some comments seemed rather creepy.
 

 
And then there were those old-fashioned 2G internet users who were completely caught off guard: “What? Isn’t Tong Zhao’s boyfriend Wei Zekai?”
 

 
And even more absurdly: “Doesn’t Tong Zhao have a boyfriend named Han Zhi?”
 

 
Fans couldn’t take it anymore: “That’s still her!”
 

 
Ning Siya couldn’t figure out why the gossip attacks didn’t seem to affect Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s other competitors saw that this “bird standing out” was rather useless—what was the point of attacking her love life? Without understanding where the pain points were, they jumped on the bandwagon, leading public opinion to ferment for an entire afternoon, shifting focus to another point:
 

 
“Rational Discussion: Is Tong Zhao’s effort to create a hard-working persona getting a bit excessive? Has she fallen off in the food variety show?”
 

 
The post scrutinized Tong Zhao’s performance in “Back to Ancient Times: Eat, Eat, Eat” and combined it with the “shopping photos” that had been taken, questioning whether her month of training in seclusion was real or just for show. Similar content appeared on Weibo marketing accounts and various public accounts. It was impossible to trace who initiated the attacks, but it could only be said that Tong Zhao had recently attracted too much attention from the opposing side.
 

 
Even if they could take down her current endorsement, that would be something.
 

 
Seeing these posts didn’t upset Tong Zhao.
 

 
But Consort Chen was quite upset.
 

 
Consort Chen felt wronged: “Isn’t it in line with my persona to be a beautiful, lazy eater? How can that be called ‘falling off’?”
 

 
She didn’t care when people talked about her, but it upset her to see Tong Zhao being poked in the back.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and said, “It’s not your fault; it’s just that there are too many people who hate me.”
 

 
The only way to avoid disputes was to quit the spotlight and stop competing with others.
 

 
By evening, the official Weibo account of the martial arts academy suddenly posted a new update, seriously clarifying recent gossip. However, the focus wasn’t on protecting Tong Zhao; instead, it highlighted the identity of the “mysterious man,” stating that he was Tong Zhao’s apprentice. The accompanying photo showed a spirited young man with a crew cut holding a certain award, smiling brightly and innocently.
 

 
This Weibo post, unlike the usual light-hearted style of Director Deng, used very formal language, and the tone was noticeably angry.
 

 
After posting the formal statement, Director Deng made a private comment that quickly became a hot comment: “That day, I suddenly had a craving for stinky tofu and oil lamp drum, so I ordered them to go to the market to buy it for me. I didn’t expect it to cause such a big fuss [Panda looking aggrieved.JPG].”
 

 
If the focus had been on protecting Tong Zhao, people might have read into it more.
 

 
Fans suddenly understood, and the attention of bystanders shifted to how Director Deng was keeping up with trends and even using memes.
 

 
This was where the matter could have ended.
 

 
Who would take something from a food and entertainment variety show seriously?
 

 
Was it really a black mark for artists to enjoy themselves? That shouldn’t be the case. However, the opposing side didn’t want to miss this opportunity… Sister Chu suspected it was because she was trying to tear up a jewelry endorsement for Tong Zhao, and the chances were quite high.
 

 
The press releases and trending topics were still being arranged; the only way to suppress them was to spend money.
 

 
Those who had been trying to undermine Tong Zhao realized there wouldn’t be any more waves, so they were preparing to give their side some positive publicity when a new development arose.
 

 
It was a promotional video edited by Huashi Sports, featuring Shi Dingjun, Tong Zhao, and the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.
 

 
Huashi Sports V:
 
“The Collision of Entertainment and Traditional Martial Arts: Tong Zhao’s 30 Days at Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Academy.”
# Chapter87
“In the modern city, amidst the hustle and bustle, there lies a classical building hidden in the depths of prosperity. Passersby, upon seeing the century-old plaque, might wonder if it belongs to an expensive private restaurant or a wealthy mansion. However, the residents nearby know that this is the residence of one of the most influential traditional martial arts masters in China and abroad…”
 

 
The opening scene features aerial shots of Qin City, suddenly zooming in on the area around the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
The hurried crowds, fast-forwarded in the footage, slow down in front of the center's outer wall, revealing the cold plum blossoms blooming outside.
 

 
Next is an interview with Elder Deng.
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “This plaque was left to me by my master. It has a history of over a hundred years and was renovated just the year before last. It looks much newer now. Some people advised me to leave it as it was, saying that would make it look like a century-old plaque. I don’t like that; there’s no need. Even if it’s repaired to look brand new, its essence will remain unchanged.”
 

 
Narration: “Elder Deng does not reject new things; however, he hasn’t taken on disciples for a long time.”
 

 
Elder Deng’s original voice: “I’ve had enough disciples. I stopped accepting new ones long ago; it’s all my students who are teaching now.”
 

 
Cameraman: “What about Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Elder Deng squints, looking at Tong Zhao talking with other disciples nearby, his tone becoming light and proud: “She’s particularly talented. I don’t feel at ease letting others teach her.”
 

 
After piquing the audience’s curiosity, the scene shifts to a close-up of Tong Zhao speaking with her disciples.
 

 
Boys, each a head taller than her, listen attentively to her insights on the course content, earnestly calling her “Auntie Master,” creating a somewhat humorous scene. With only her slender brows drawn and a natural light makeup of pink lipstick, she appears to the straight male audience as though she’s naturally beautiful without any embellishment. Even if they can’t understand what she’s saying, they can’t help but be drawn to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Do you understand now?”
 

 
Disciple One hesitantly replies: “I understand…”
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “I think you don’t understand; just jump right in and practice.”
 

 
[There’s a kind of misunderstanding where the master’s niece thinks you don’t understand.]
 

 
[Jumping right in seems fine, though! Hahaha.]
 

 
[So fierce; Tong Zhao must be the only female star who can fall into a den of men without any romantic vibes.]
 

 
[No romantic vibe, but there’s definitely a sense of intimidation…]
 

 
Saying this, the two of them went into the inner area, where the other disciples instinctively surrounded them, creating a large open space.
 

 
Narration: “The martial arts school preserves the tradition of sparring, emphasizing control and restraint. Elder Deng mentioned that there used to be people who would challenge the school, but that hasn’t happened in a long time.”
 

 
A clip followed showing Tong Zhao first using her elbow, then delivering a powerful kick with her left leg, taking down her opponent in quick succession. It is often said that traditional Chinese martial arts use softness to overcome hardness, but all sports emphasize fundamental techniques. This concept is similar to weight classes in sports—different weight categories are used to separate competitors. For example, professional boxing has seventeen distinct weight classes, ranging from heavyweight to mini-flyweight.
 

 
Even Elder Deng couldn’t understand why Tong Zhao had such strength.
 

 
Not only was her power explosive in an instant, but she also had endurance. She could easily handle the wheel battles with her disciples. That’s why, in a short time, she managed to subdue this group of spirited young men, causing them to stop viewing her as a beautiful older sister and instead recognize her as a formidable master who was beyond their capabilities.
 

 
Viewers who saw this couldn’t believe their eyes and rewound the footage several times.
 

 
This was not a sequence designed by a choreographer in advance!
 

 
This was a real fight performed by real people!
 

 
The unwillingness and admiration on the young men’s faces didn’t look like acting.
 

 
The complete episode was uploaded on Huashi TV, primarily to promote the Jingwu Sports Martial Arts Center.
 

 
Director Deng had many older Chinese fans who all had martial arts dreams but never pursued them due to various real-life reasons, or who had learned when they were younger but later abandoned it. When they saw this girl performing beautiful and smooth martial arts moves on TV and learned she was a star…
 

 
—“In the past, when I suggested you learn martial arts, you thought it was too tough and didn’t go. Look, mastering martial arts can lead to becoming a big star!”
 

 
—“Dad, martial arts has nothing to do with being a star…”
 

 
—“Are our Chinese female stars really this strong now?”
 

 
—“Luzi, come here and tell Dad, has this girl acted in any movies?”
 

 
As the full episode aired simultaneously, similar conversations arose in different households.
 

 
The later content focused on Tong Zhao’s life over the month she spent learning martial arts at the dojo, presenting the seemingly surreal life of martial arts from her perspective. They had a very down-to-earth side: many long-time disciples had become action designers, while those who hadn’t yet graduated were often working part-time jobs that required physical labor, alongside attending night school.
 

 
Tong Zhao would wake up before dawn to make breakfast for Master Deng, persisting day after day for a month, honoring the way of respecting her teacher.
 

 
The day she went to the market to buy snacks for Elder Deng was also documented by the cameraman.
 

 
However, not wanting to attract attention from passersby with a cameraman carrying a long lens, the camera only captured her getting into the car driven by her disciple.
 

 
The rumors and gossip naturally fell apart here—
 

 
That “mysterious man” was someone Tong Zhao had previously mercilessly pinned to the ground!
 

 
Can this be called love?
 

 
She would be better off if her older sister could date, right?
 

 
The complete version aired on television and various video platforms mainly discussed traditional martial arts culture and introduced the dojo. However, the edited version on Weibo understood what online viewers loved to see, highlighting all the exciting moments. Naturally, it included the impressive segments of Tong Zhao taking on her disciples in wheel battles, as well as her quick cuts of waking up early for thirty days, with shots of the breakfast she prepared.
 

 
You could see that although the dishes were simple, they were made with skill.
 

 
This also helped dispel the previous accusations of her being lazy and indulging in pleasures.
 

 
[So what if she relaxed a bit while participating in a variety show themed around food and fun? When she was genuinely learning, she was very willing to wake up early to make breakfast for her master.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao looks like the type who is very filial. I wonder if her deadbeat dad will regret seeing this program. Will his mistress's daughter cook for him every day when he gets old?]
 

 
[I really want to eat the breakfast made by Zhao Zhao!!!]
 

 
...
 

 
However, the hottest topic of discussion was still Tong Zhao defeating her disciples using the martial arts taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Not only were the disciples surprised, but the audience was too.
 

 
It turns out that Tong Zhao could not only fight in instinctive variety shows but was also highly skilled in real life?
 

 
This completely shattered public perception.
 

 
Last time, Tong Zhao showcased her athletic abilities that rivaled muscular men at the promotional event for "One Life Survivor," but actually fighting was a different matter. After all, everyone was used to the subconscious belief that people could achieve things in instinctive movies that they couldn't in reality...
 

 
In real life, an 180 cm tall guy was easily taken down by Tong Zhao?
 

 
[Old man on the subway looking at his phone.jpg]
 

 
Not only could she fight, but she also used the techniques taught by Elder Deng.
 

 
Her performance was practically textbook-level in terms of promotional impact—smooth, elegant, and powerful.
 

 
Netizens collectively raised a soul-searching question—
 

 
How many more surprises does this woman have that they don’t know about?
 

 
In the secluded world of Tong Zhao’s home, Xu Zhu felt for the 108th time that Tong Zhao must have been possessed or time-traveled, because she had grown up with Tong Zhao and had no idea she had a martial arts background... or perhaps it was because she had never truly acknowledged her "best friend" or genuinely understood her.
 

 
However, Xu Zhu’s thoughts had become irrelevant to Tong Zhao and the netizens.
 

 
...
 

 
The large-scale, deliberately created doubts had attracted significant attention from netizens.
 

 
Then, just like that, the promotional video released by the official Huashi turned the situation around.
 

 
Wow.
 

 
This wave was free publicity!
 

 
If it hadn’t been for the intense backlash earlier, the effect wouldn’t be so good now. Of course, the credit also went to Tong Zhao's manager, who monitored public sentiment, contacted Elder Deng, and coordinated with Huashi to establish a promotional plan. This not only promoted traditional martial arts but also cleverly clarified the negative rumors while boosting Tong Zhao’s reputation and popularity with the public.
 

 
This was a classic example of public relations that achieved three goals with one shot, elevating Sister Chu’s reputation in the industry. Many artists with contracts ending soon wanted to switch to her management, but she turned down quite a few, saying she couldn’t take them all on.
 

 
In the domestic entertainment industry, while it can feel vast, it can also feel quite small.
 

 
Sister Chu proudly shared her triumph in her social circle:
 

 
[When the retrograde hits, small-minded people swarm around; when it's over, we rise with the momentum! When others ask me if working with artists is hard, I say it is. There's no possibility of a stable routine; fabricated scandals don't adhere to a 9-to-5 schedule, and I often get phone calls at midnight. Plus, there’s one exceptionally talented artist whose invites for variety shows, movies, and TV dramas are so numerous that I couldn’t sort through them even after three sleepless nights. Sigh. Hang in there, hardworking people!】
 

 
The attached photo shows a large stack of documents, with a corner revealing the name "Tong Zhao."
 

 
Everyone knows that Tong Zhao is the most formidable artist under Sister Chu's management.
 

 
This social media post could be considered a modern classic of “humblebragging.”
 

 
This post, pretending to complain but actually showing off, poked at many people's sore spots—
 

 
There are so many who envy Tong Zhao that a few more won’t make a difference. The ones secretly undermining her, especially Ning Siya, were furious after realizing they inadvertently wove her a wedding dress and couldn’t eat all day. Of course, that competitive jewelry endorsement also benefited from this publicity on Huashi, greatly enhancing Tong Zhao's image, allowing her to secure the deal.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s team popped champagne to celebrate, while she just handled the mundane task of taking photos and collecting payment, even giving her manager's post a like.
 

 
Does it do any good to be jealous of her?
 

 
Not at all. When Shi Dingjun started filming "The Knives of the Maiden," Tong Zhao returned to Qin City, where her jewelry advertisement was already prominently displayed at the city’s most prestigious shopping center, with the highest rent and foot traffic.
 

 
With her black hair and snow-white skin, Tong Zhao smiled faintly, her red lips curving slightly.
 

 
Her chin slightly raised, accentuating her beautifully defined jawline, she wore a diamond necklace adorned with large sapphires. Her thick, soft black hair was pulled back, exuding a cold yet beautiful aura. The diamond earrings shaped like snakes hugged her shell-like ears, giving her a unique villainous charm.
 

 
This poster was a performance passionately delivered by Consort Chen.
 

 
She had previously thought about having her portrait hung on the palace walls so that people could see what the most beautiful favored concubine looked like. However, the painter's skills were limited, and she wasn't used to ink portraits. Moreover, the emperor was incredibly jealous, so she gave up.
 

 
Therefore, this endorsement satisfied her vanity.
 

 
No matter how luxurious the cars passing by are or how affluent the pedestrians appear, they must lift their heads to look up at her in the advertisement.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao's entertainment company is directly across from this shopping plaza.
 

 
The people who plotted against her during this incident would have to constantly look up at this strikingly beautiful advertisement…
 

 
As Ning Siya stepped out of the chauffeur-driven car on her way to the company, her eyes immediately caught sight of the advertisement across the street. She squeezed the Starbucks cup in her hand, causing it to crumple slightly. In the lower left corner of the poster was Tong Zhao's signature and her introduction: [Popular Female Star of 20xx].
 

 
Popular female star?
 

 
Ning Siya saw her as an infuriating star!
 

 
...
 

 
Qin City, high-end VIP shooting studio.
 

 
Tong Zhao's holographic shooting pod was separate from the others.
 

 
The other characters were in a large filming studio, which was one of the privileges of being a lead actor.
 

 
"Can we start?"
 

 
After checking the equipment, all the crew members took their places.
 

 
With a command from the director, countless consciousness streams flowed into the device, and the monitoring screens suddenly lit up.
 

 
It was as if they were in another world.
 

 
"The Knives of the Maiden" had a lighthearted tone, beginning with a theft of cultural relics. Dressed in black, with long hair tied in a ponytail, Fu Xuancheng stealthily took an ancient sword and left a new replica next to the safe before elegantly departing. This action choreography was created by Director Deng's sixth disciple, who, despite his honest and sturdy appearance, excelled at fluid martial arts movements. He was humorously nicknamed the "most agile fat guy" by his brothers in the school.
 

 
The same martial arts moves performed by the exceptionally fit rising star Zeng Mingjun appeared suave and charming.
 

 
The supervisor nodded repeatedly, saying, "Your brother's choreography is impeccable; the details are spot on."
 

 
Director Shi lamented, "He couldn’t squeeze in the time to attend classes; the start and end of his movements always feel a bit stiff."
 

 
"There’s no helping it; after all, it's a predetermined program without his personal input."
 

 
The backstage was orderly, monitoring every detail of the film like gods fulfilling their roles, ensuring the world continued to operate smoothly.
 

 
The original footage hadn’t been edited yet.
 

 
However, the director already had an idea in mind: the scene should freeze on the villain Fu Xuancheng leaping on the rooftop, the corners of his trench coat billowing, creating a light-and-shadow silhouette under the moonlight. This shot would be captured by passersby and appear on the front page the next day. Meanwhile, the protagonist Xie Guiya's boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, would excitedly bring this clipping to show off to his girlfriend.
 

 
Tong Zhao entered Cheng Siwen's line of sight, and he saw her walking toward him and sitting down at a milk tea shop.
 

 
Up until this point, everything was fine.
 

 
After Tong Zhao appeared, the supervisor remarked, "I've heard that many TV dramas have sent her scripts, but I think she’s more suited for the big screen. Her figure is truly exceptional; even in this ordinary college casual wear, she still stands out. From the side, her physique is simply different—like a swan among a flock of ducks."
 

 
The assistant director added, "She’s the kind of person who makes you understand why others are background actors while she is the star."
 

 
"Alright, let’s stop before we sound like fans ourselves."
 

 
A few Tong Zhao fans, "lurking" among the crew, were internally cheering.
 

 
In the scene, Cheng Siwen excitedly recounted the modern martial arts-style theft case from the previous night to his girlfriend, along with the silhouette: "It couldn't be wrong; what ordinary thief would dress like that while standing on a rooftop? Look at the agility described; it must be lightness skills!”
 

 
The photo of the master thief standing atop a tall pillar dominated more than half the page.
 

 
In the corner of the society section was a small news piece about seven punks who had suffered varying degrees of minor injuries and were fainting on the side of the street.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was supposed to have a strong aversion to martial arts and heroes, frowned upon hearing her boyfriend's sermon.
 

 
She clearly disagreed with what he was saying.
 

 
In the script, she was supposed to react strongly and refute Cheng Siwen, making him feel deflated.
 

 
However, on screen, Tong Zhao's brows relaxed, and her expression instantly softened: "I think your reasoning, Siwen, makes a lot of sense, and it’s quite interesting."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn't she supposed to start scolding him right away?
 

 
The screenwriter was puzzled.
 

 
Cheng Siwen's eyes lit up at his girlfriend's approval: "Really?"
 

 
"Yes, of course."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded. Her slightly lowered gaze revealed her inner skepticism, but her attitude remained very accommodating as she engaged in a discussion about martial arts with him.
 

 
It's quite common for actors to subconsciously deviate from the script.
 

 
However, no one expected it to happen so quickly. The screenwriter and director discussed it and speculated that Tong Zhao's month-long stay at the martial arts school had significantly increased her acceptance of traditional martial arts, making her subconscious rejection of martial arts something she couldn’t quite reconcile!
 

 
So what should they do now?
 

 
The character designer shook his head: "This is a core setting; it shouldn't be so easily shaken."
 

 
In the next moment, as they left the milk tea shop after paying, Tong Zhao took Cheng Siwen's hand and gently told him that she actually didn't like martial arts and really hated things like heroes. Her tone was warm yet firm, and both Cheng Siwen and the viewers in front of the monitor could clearly feel her resistance and aversion.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was stunned.
 

 
"Then why didn’t you tell me that just now? Why did you let me keep talking?"
 

 
"Because you’re my boyfriend, and you were speaking to me. I wanted to hear you finish and understand your perspective," Tong Zhao's voice was already charming, and in this film, it sounded even more melodious. However, it was not the sultry tone from the time of "The Legend of Ming," but instead carried a neutral, calming, and mysterious power: "Let’s keep things separate; I also want to be honest with you about my views."
 

 
Tong Zhao said, "I really hate martial arts, and heroes shouldn’t exist. I don't accept that."
 

 
She held his hand tightly, her expression focused as she looked at him.
 

 
In her slightly pale eyes lay a world he didn’t know about.
 

 
Director Shi was captivated by her eyes, and a light bulb went off in his head: "I just got inspired! We should give Tong Zhao a close-up here, then transition directly from her eyes to her returning home, facing the man known as the last hero of China, Father Xie!"
 

 
The screenwriter, who wanted to say something but held back: "..."
 

 
Fine.
 

 
As long as the actors want to change things, they can, as long as he doesn’t have to rewrite the script!
 

 
Like traditional films, the status of the screenwriter varies; in "The Knives of the Maiden this particular one was on the lower end, essentially serving as a tool.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Here, Tong Zhao's performance has come full circle. Compared to what she unconsciously improvised, the original plot felt a bit overdone."
 

 
Supervisor: "But the original version would be funnier, right?"
 

 
Assistant Director: "That’s true…"
 

 
The group held differing opinions, but ultimately, there was no disagreement that this way of handling the character would likely create a better first impression for the audience and make her more likable. After all, the protagonist’s strong aversion to martial arts in the early stages might make some Chinese viewers uncomfortable, thinking she was too rebellious. Tong Zhao's way of addressing her rebellious feelings showed her subconscious capacity for tolerance and deep-rooted gentleness.
 

 
Reporters need to think critically, digging deep to uncover the truth hidden beneath a facade of peace.
 

 
However, interrupting the interviewee too often is generally considered taboo.
 

 
Thus, the reporter’s subconscious, despite harboring resentment toward traditional martial arts, would still endure and attentively listen to her boyfriend until he finished speaking.
 

 
There were no problems up to this point.
 

 
After returning home, Tong Zhao happened to see her father, who had been injured while fighting multiple opponents late at night, alone and applying medicinal alcohol. When he saw his daughter return, he let out a loud groan and pretended he couldn’t reach the injury, performing for a while. Noticing that his daughter did not react, he sadly asked, “My daughter, aren’t you going to ask why I’m hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: "People who take risks often end up hurt."
 

 
Father Xie: "That wasn’t reckless; I was being a hero."
 

 
Hearing those four words made Tong Zhao’s head throb.
 

 
When she was young, her father was so obsessed with being a vigilante that he neglected her education. Every time Father Xie managed to carve out some time to come home, he never asked about her homework, didn’t accompany her to movies, or care about school matters; he only taught her martial arts. Ironically, she learned quickly and became skilled, which motivated him further, making him feel like he was nurturing the second-best fighter in the martial arts world!
 

 
After their parents divorced, her mother took her brother away, and the father-daughter relationship plunged to an all-time low.
 

 
Tong Zhao shot him a glance: “Even the leader of the martial arts world can get beaten?”
 

 
“Pfft, a few little brats didn’t even touch my clothes.”
 

 
Father Xie stepped lightly, gracefully landing on the sofa next to Tong Zhao, wearing an expression that said [I’m injured, but I’m just acting]. He looked at his daughter: “Did you see the news? Those seven little brats were harassing a girl in public, and I had to teach them a little lesson. I believe if you had been there, you would have made the same choice as I did.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and chuckled: “I would create a distraction while calling the police; using violence to counter violence is the last resort.”
 

 
…
 

 
Screenwriter: “Originally, I wrote that they would get into an argument here.”
 

 
After discovering that her boyfriend particularly admired vigilantes at the milk tea shop, the protagonist returned home filled with frustration, only to find the source of her real anger was her father’s incessant chatter about being a hero. Her anger instantly doubled, pouring cold water on her father, who had been excitedly trying to improve their relationship.
 

 
The protagonist and her father share similar stubbornness, but their thought processes differ due to their contrasting upbringings.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen did not argue. After returning home, although she sparred verbally with her father, her thoughts were clear, and her speech was coherent.
 

 
Instinctual movies and quick-transitions through books are both susceptible to the butterfly effect.
 

 
Supervisor's Comment: "I think this version of the protagonist is more reasonable; after all, she’s a gifted student from a prestigious university."
 

 
Screenwriter: ‘Covering their face:’ "To be honest, I also think she’s performing very adorably."
 

 
Especially when she gives her dad a little smile; it really hits his soft spot!
 

 
However, just because Tong Zhao offered him a hint of a smile, Father Xie’s lips moved, and he blurted out, “Did you see today’s headline in the social news?”
 

 
The backstage crew, who had been joking around, immediately froze.
 

 
This dialogue should have occurred in at least two scenes later. How could Zhang Jianyi (the actor playing Father Xie) have such a lack of discretion? Just because his daughter smiled at him, he said that? Didn’t he fear that she would get upset and refuse to continue acting? What happened to the buildup?
 

 
Upon hearing this, Tong Zhao indeed stopped smiling.
 

 
Her lightly colored eyes swept over her father, and her brows furrowed, clearly displaying her displeasure and unwillingness to continue this topic.
 

 
But…
 

 
"You go ahead," she said.
# Chapter88
"The mysterious thief must have some remarkable skills in light-footwork," remarked Father Xie.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, "Mm-hmm, and then?"
 

 
Father Xie continued, "Mid-next month is the once-a-decade martial arts conference, and I suspect this is a provocation aimed at that gathering. Last time, there were three attendees—all of whom used the weapons that were just stolen. Especially that sword—only the Plum Blossom Swordsman would use such a noisy weapon like the Yan Wing Saber."
 

 
The Yan Wing Saber has five or more holes on its spine with bronze rings hanging from them. When swung, the rings clatter against the blade, creating a sound much like a wild goose's call. Tong Zhao nodded again, asking, "And what kind of person is the Plum Blossom Swordsman?"
 

 
The crew watched as the protagonist’s father proceeded to spill all the information about this future character, without restraint. He even shared the unknown secret that, ten years ago, the Plum Blossom Swordsman took out a high-interest loan just to replace all the bronze rings on his Yan Wing Saber with gold ones, missing the prime time to buy property. Now, this once-famous swordsman was still renting an apartment. Even the director didn’t know this detail. Director Shi glanced at the screenwriter and said, "You’ve created quite a rich backstory."
 

 
The screenwriter chuckled awkwardly, "I just enjoy adding hidden quirks to characters that might never get discovered."
 

 
The assistant director suggested, "This is a good place to insert a segment showcasing the Plum Blossom Swordsman, with Father Xie’s narration as the voiceover."
 

 
Director Shi agreed, and an assistant immediately added a note to the timeline. Since they weren’t editing as they shot, these notes would make post-production smoother, preventing any fleeting inspirations from slipping away.
 

 
…
 

 
Father Xie, oblivious to how much he'd been prodded into revealing, was delighted, thinking his daughter was finally interested in the martial world.
 

 
Encouraged, he boldly suggested sparring with her.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and refused, heading straight to her room. "I’m not doing something so pointless anymore."
 

 
"How can you call it pointless?" Father Xie looked visibly disappointed.
 

 
"It has meaning for you, so use ‘your’ time on it. But don’t force it onto my life," Tong Zhao said, pausing as she closed the door. With a trace of self-mockery, she added, "That said, I guess I’m stating the obvious, considering all your time has always been spent on this."
 

 
With that, she closed the door, sealing it as firmly as she had her heart.
 

 
In the original script, this scene had the protagonist slamming the door to show her dissatisfaction. However, Tong Zhao’s movements were understated—the door closed gently, blending smoothly into the frame without disturbing even the air. Yet this subtlety conveyed a sense of suffocating restraint, even more intense than if she had slammed the door. The camera followed Tong Zhao as she entered her room and picked up a small wooden dagger on her desk—a “toy” her father had given her as a child. Her childhood had no pretty dolls, no make-believe games; only martial arts and various martial arts-related "toys."
 

 
As a child, in pursuit of her father’s praise, she had trained diligently, displaying an exceptional talent for martial arts.
 

 
Father Xie's enthusiasm was partly fueled by the possibility that his daughter might carry on his legacy.
 

 
On the surveillance screen, Tong Zhao remained silent, her elegant face frozen without expression, as if time had stopped along with the air around her. Even through the screen, the crew could feel the suffocating tension. In the original script, the protagonist had several confrontational scenes early on to establish her character, but Tong Zhao’s subconscious had erased all of them, creating a more layered, subdued, and heartbreaking portrayal of a young woman.
 

 
She didn’t stay silent for long—perhaps only half a minute.
 

 
Yet why was the pressure so intense?
 

 
One perceptive crew member noticed, "She’s gripping the wooden dagger tightly; it’s pressing into her palm."
 

 
"Yes," Director Shi murmured thoughtfully. "Her body language is incredibly expressive."
 

 
As an older director, Shi had trained during the era when traditional films were dominant, studying both representational and method acting. Representational actors use specific expressions, gestures, or props as cues, allowing the audience to understand a character through these signals.
 

 
To use an example from anime, seeing a character with black hair and glasses might immediately bring to mind traits like intelligence or a sly nature. Creators often lean into such stereotypes when building characters.
 

 
But instinctive cinema doesn’t normally use representational methods.
 

 
Tong Zhao, however, was the closest thing to it he had ever seen. She would often employ small, signature gestures to reinforce a character's image. For example, in ‘Emperor Ming’, her consort character habitually took the emperor’s hand and nestled her face into it. Dedicated fans even made a compilation of these moments, noticing that she repeated this gesture almost every time she interacted with him, creating a lasting impression through repetition.
 

 
It was almost like intentional performance.
 

 
Suddenly, Tong Zhao moved.
 

 
Her face remained cold and expressionless, stripped of the gentle facade she showed to others. With surprising speed, she began twirling the wooden dagger in her hand. But the dagger wasn’t enough to release her frustration; with a flick of her wrist, she expertly threw it, landing it perfectly in its stand on her desk. Then, she picked up the sword lying beside her bed…
 

 
A protagonist who despised martial arts, now channeling her anger, executed three full sets of martial arts routines—combining forms from different schools—to vent her frustration.
 

 
This wasn’t in the script, either.
 

 
As she was about to sheath her sword, her father burst into the room, oblivious as always. "Guiya, I made your favorite char siu rice. Don’t be mad—"
 

 
His words trailed off as he froze, staring at his daughter wielding the sword.
 

 
That expression could only be described as, "I walked in and caught Chang Wei attacking Lai Fu."
 

 
‘Chang Wei, you said you didn’t know martial arts?’
 

 
Tong Zhao, you said you didn’t like martial arts?
 

 
Tong Zhao turned back coldly, pursed her lips, and calmly sheathed her sword. “I’ll come out to eat later. Dad, please leave for now; I’m changing.”
 

 
Father Xie was puzzled. “But…”
 

 
His daughter was clearly fully dressed!
 

 
Tong Zhao repeated, using her mesmerizing voice, “I’m changing.”
 

 
“Alright, alright, I’ll leave right now.”
 

 
Indulgent as ever, her father quickly closed the door and left.
 

 
The bedroom returned to silence.
 

 
On screen, a soft pink blush crept onto Tong Zhao’s elegant face, her ears turning red.
 

 
---
 

 
The director and assistant director were deep in discussion about the storyline. Meanwhile, the screenwriter had rolled off to a corner, munching on snacks and complaining to the character designer, “Tong Zhao’s subconscious is incredible at rewriting the story. I’d heard Old Bei mention that she had erased an intricately designed power struggle scene he’d crafted, but I thought that was just a one-time thing. Turns out, this is standard practice for her!”
 

 
Old Bei was the screenwriter for ‘Emperor’s Meng’.
 

 
He’d spent two sleepless nights writing the plot around the Eastern Sea Pearl, sparking a rivalry between two ministers—only for the pearl to be handed off to the consort played by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Screenwriter: “The character model for Xie Guiya is your design, Cheng. You must feel my pain, right?”
 

 
Character designer: “Uh, well…”
 

 
Character designer: “But…isn’t her performance adorable? So…maybe it’s okay?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “?”
 

 
‘When I put a question mark, it’s not that I have a question—I think ‘you’ have a problem.’
 

 
It’s hopeless, bury it.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s practice scene in her room was a small solo martial arts sequence intended to captivate the audience and remind them that this is an action film. Clearly, she delivered. After a month of training, the choreography embedded by the action designer was no longer just a string of rigid moves—it had become an instinctive skill integrated into her subconscious.
 

 
The lead action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ commented, “Luckily, Fu Xuancheng’s lightfoot escape sequence appears first. Otherwise, after seeing the junior sister’s fight scenes, the audience wouldn’t be as captivated by his agility. Compared to her, he’s just performing the moves without depth.”
 

 
Director Shi nodded in agreement. “Her dedication has even earned praise from the masters.”
 

 
Through this brief father-daughter interaction, Xie Guiya’s character was already well-established. Next came a tightly paced dialogue scene, unveiling the movie’s central conflict and introducing the antagonist—Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
In ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, the villain and protagonist are complete opposites.
 

 
Xie Guiya’s mother is a strong and independent woman who, after divorcing her husband, single-handedly raised her son with the child support and her wages, occasionally calling her daughter. In stark contrast, Fu Xuancheng’s mother is a martial artist from a lineage that includes three generations of practitioners of a dark martial arts sect, while his father is a corrupt man involved in gambling, drugs, and other vices. Though his mother had the skills to protect herself, her intense love for her husband made her afraid that standing up to him would lead to his rejection, causing her to tolerate the domestic violence inflicted on her and her children.
 

 
Growing up in a twisted family, Fu Xuancheng’s inner self was like a dark green plant nourished in a swamp.
 

 
Like the protagonist’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, he loved reading martial arts novels. At some point, he even discovered that his mother was one of the legendary figures who knew mystical martial arts. Excited, he went to ask her about it, but instead of praise, he was scolded; his mother forbade him from ever bringing up martial arts again.
 

 
This was because Fu’s father preferred weak women.
 

 
More than that, on the very night that Fu’s mother received a promotion and a raise that put her income slightly above his, he humiliated her to shatter her self-esteem.
 

 
From that point on, Fu Xuancheng realized that his mother had the ability to resist and protect him.
 

 
But she simply chose not to.
 

 
Because her son was merely a tool to keep her husband around.
 

 
At that stage, young Fu did not turn dark; he accepted this logic.
 

 
It wasn’t until Fu’s father was laid off, gambled away his severance pay, got kicked out of an underground casino, drank at a street vendor without paying, and was beaten when he couldn’t cover the bill, that he returned home in disgrace. Furious, he turned on his wife and child who never fought back, yelling, “You think I suffer like this for my own sake?!” Then he beat Fu Xuancheng half to death. At that moment, Fu’s mother, pushed to her limit, resisted for the first time.
 

 
She had gone so long without using her martial arts, and the skills she had were of the most brutal, sinister type.
 

 
In her attempt to stop him, she accidentally killed the man she loved most.
 

 
No one cared about the disappearance of a social outcast like him, and Fu Xuancheng, being so young, had little experience in covering up a crime. He emptied out the refrigerator and struggled to fit his “father” inside. He thought that with his father gone, all their pain would end, that he could finally live a normal life like his classmates. But after he had healed, he came home from school one day to find his mother hanging from the ceiling.
 

 
She had followed the man she loved into another world.
 

 
So what was he left to be?
 

 
When the neighbors called the police due to the stench, and social workers came to take Fu Xuancheng away, he was still unable to understand. Desperate for answers, he searched frantically through his mother’s belongings and found the manual for her sinister martial arts techniques.
 

 
His views were the opposite of the heroine’s.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng believed his mother was completely wrong.
 

 
If she had wanted to keep his father, she should have subdued him with force from the start. Leaving a powerful weapon unused and hoping that love would change him was putting the cart before the horse.
 

 
Martial arts novels often touch on the question of wielding power for control or submission—
 

 
When such discussions arise, they pull the reader from the fantastical world of martial arts back to reality. But if they don’t discuss it, the stories feel somewhat unrealistic.
 

 
Under the influence of the dark martial arts manual, Fu Xuancheng’s ambitions became old-fashioned and somewhat out of place. He dreamed of unifying the martial arts world and becoming its supreme leader. Ironically, in modern times, almost no one practices martial arts; even fitness-based martial arts gyms—which lack any real martial arts skill—see barely any customers.
 

 
In the end, he would be unifying an empty, lonely world.
 

 
Two years ago, a so-called "grandmaster" claimed to be the head of the Xingyi Tai Chi sect. Fu Xuancheng, eager for a fight, raced to his door under the cover of night (by high-speed rail). It turned out the man was a fraud, just another con artist. Disappointed, Fu defeated him and returned home, resolving from then on to seek out real "martial artists," intent on challenging them to truly unify the martial arts world...
 

 
The actor playing Fu Xuancheng, Jiang Dang, is known for his eccentric personality in real life, endearingly nicknamed the "crazy beauty" by his fans. Jiang has a rather unusual mindset.
 

 
Reporters find it hard to interview him because he often seems lost in his own world, sporting a mischievous yet alluring smile while barely responding to questions. Fortunately, he’s well-behaved when it comes to reading the PR scripts his agent prepares for him. He’s managed to stay scandal-free, but his recent puzzling “scandal” came when he starred in a romance drama with a new actress. The variety show they later appeared on together had accepted a favor from the actress’s agent, hoping to create a romance buzz around them. No matter what he asked, the editing team planned to spin it as “cute” chemistry.
 

 
But his question was, “Do you think tomatoes really like being paired with scrambled eggs as a national favorite?”
 

 
By afternoon, the internet exploded, with fans assuming Jiang was shading the actress for trying to force a “couple” image with him. Later that evening, paparazzi reported that Jiang had ordered a simple boxed meal for dinner: tomato and scrambled egg over rice.
 

 
Well, that escalated quickly.
 

 
Fans abandoned the intended romance storyline and instead debated whether Jiang’s emotional intelligence might have been entirely spent on his beauty.
 

 
In the story, Fu Xuancheng arrives in Qin City to search for any remaining “martial artists.” He creates a series of sensational stunts, hoping to draw them out. His main target is none other than the last rumored “hero of China”—the heroine’s father.
 

 
But will these antics draw in the heroine?
 

 
The answer is no. It’s her boyfriend who takes the bait.
 

 
The screenwriter brags, “This move, you see, is a masterful way of sneaking around to our goal!”
 

 
The character designer gives him a slap on the back of the head, “Please, stop butchering idioms like that.”
 

 
Screenwriter: QAQ
 

 
So what exactly does Jiang Dang’s Fu Xuancheng do?
 

 
Under the screenwriter’s omnipotent guidance, every time Fu Xuancheng makes a scene, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen just happen to be there.
 

 
For instance, when Fu shatters the face of the iconic clock tower—Qin City’s prime dating spot—by shooting an arrow in broad daylight, Tong Zhao and Cheng Siwen are holding hands right below it. Shattered glass falls dangerously close to Cheng, but Tong swiftly pulls him into her arms, saying, “Be careful.”
 

 
The arrowhead is deeply embedded in the clock face.
 

 
Tong looks towards the direction the arrow came from, but all she catches is a glimpse of a trench coat vanishing around the corner.
 

 
Cheng’s eyes light up with excitement, eager to investigate. However, knowing his girlfriend dislikes his fascination with all things martial arts, he restrains himself. Only after seeing Tong home does he race back to the clock tower, channeling his inner detective and asking around if anyone has seen a man in a trench coat. By chance, he ends up asking Fu Xuancheng himself (minus his “getaway” trench coat).
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked, "Did you see the person who shot the arrow?"
 

 
Cheng Siwen shook his head honestly. "No, I didn’t. That’s why I want to find him!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng asked why he was so interested, noting that Cheng seemed far too innocent to be a police officer.
 

 
Cheng eagerly shared his thoughts, convinced the mysterious archer must be a true hero. "McCarthy said, 'If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it’s a duck.'"
 

 
“You really have a lot of free time,” Fu Xuancheng remarked with a sigh, then added, “But if you find him, what do you plan to do? What if he’s actually a bad guy?”
 

 
The two chatted aimlessly for a while. Perhaps Fu Xuancheng hadn’t had a casual conversation in a long time, or maybe Cheng’s guileless nature simply made people feel at ease. Fu eventually confessed, “I, too, am searching for real heroes in this city. I believe they’re out there.”
 

 
Someone like him.
 

 
Cheng nodded excitedly, thrilled to have found someone who shared his thoughts. This wasn’t just a random stranger; this was a kindred spirit!
 

 
Since the other person was a man, Cheng didn’t worry about his girlfriend getting jealous... although he had never actually seen her get jealous. She was always warm and gentle, occasionally patting his head affectionately.
 

 
After an awkward but heartfelt exchange, Cheng reluctantly left, casting longing glances over his shoulder, completely unaware that he’d just escaped a dangerous situation.
 

 
...
 

 
Originally, this scene was supposed to be Fu Xuancheng meeting the heroine. However, after some discussion, the crew felt it wouldn’t work.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s incredible ability to extract information, the actor playing Fu, Jiang Dang, would likely end up spilling every detail of his life, including his birthday and first love’s name. It felt much safer to send Cheng Siwen, with his innocent, straightforward nature. Unintentionally, the secondary male lead had become the perfect "tool" character, and the assistant director who recommended him to the team felt immensely proud.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s next move involved inviting a professor at the heroine’s university to create a calligraphy piece of the phrase “Invincible Solitude.”
 

 
In the classroom at that time, Cheng Siwen had woken up late and, sensing something was off, quickly ducked back down. Because he was lying in the last row, he only caught a quick glimpse before hiding, so Fu didn’t notice him.
 

 
This incident would later create a plot twist during a scene where they try to identify each other.
 

 
But then, the butterfly effect began to unfold.
 

 
The journalist Shuyi had long anticipated that her boyfriend’s curiosity about the "mysterious thief" would likely get him into trouble. She was far more attentive to him than her script required. With meticulous detail, she checked his class schedule and, noticing he hadn’t responded for a while after class, decided to look for him. She ended up running straight into the professor, who was being forced to write calligraphy, and Fu Xuancheng!
 

 
The first fight scene was about to erupt—
 

 
Screenwriter: “So, does this mean the character recognition scene I designed is scrapped again?”
 

 
Character Modeler: “Looks like it.”
 

 
Screenwriter: “Damn it.”
 

 
The screenwriter was frustrated, but then realized that this would be an impromptu fight scene, unscripted and unplanned by the action choreographer. This meant Shuyi’s moves would come entirely from her subconscious.
 

 
Without the guidance of a fight choreographer, most actors simply can’t pull off a convincing fight scene—this is widely acknowledged in the industry.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng is, after all, a grown man. Even without planned moves, he should be able to handle a young woman easily, right? The screenwriter knew that Shuyi had some martial arts training, but the difference in strength was still significant.
 

 
Director Shi frowned, sensing trouble. “Quick, come up with a reason why Fu Xuancheng can’t use his full strength! Have a passing student call the police, so we can wrap this up sooner!”
 

 
He needed to justify why Fu Xuancheng wouldn’t be able to defeat the not-yet-awakened heroine without disrupting the plot entirely.
 

 
Director Shi had seen Tong Zhao sparring with her junior disciples at the martial arts studio and knew her skills were extraordinarily sharp. But please, just don’t let her defeat the villain boss here and now!
 

 
…
 

 
The backstage crew was in chaos. On set, the dim classroom was lit only by natural light from the large windows, casting long shadows of Fu Xuancheng and Shuyi, creating a beautifully dramatic composition.
 

 
Shuyi immediately pulled out her phone to call the police.
 

 
But before she could press 110, a flying sword sliced through the air toward her, forcing her to dodge to the side.
 

 
“Oh?” Fu Xuancheng’s interest was piqued.
 

 
…
 

 
The assistant director was nervous. “We need to make Shuyi afraid somehow… this isn’t the right moment for dialogue between them! Can the modeler come up with something?”
 

 
“Absolutely,” the modeler replied confidently.
 

 
To handle various unexpected situations, the modeler had prepared numerous emergency codes.
 

 
…
 

 
Shuyi studied him.
 

 
He had a striking, devilishly handsome face. His high-bridged nose and thin lips gave him the classic look of a male lead in a novel, while his narrow, phoenix-like eyes flashed with an unsettling intensity that sent chills down one’s spine. Of course, while ‘Instinct’ could blur the line with reality, it couldn’t convey hundreds of words of internal monologue through a single flicker in someone’s gaze. However, inducing a shiver was much easier.
 

 
Under the influence of a pre-set program from the “Hand of God” crew, Shuyi’s back cooled perceptibly as Fu Xuancheng fixed his gaze on her with interest.
 

 
Huh?
 

 
An ordinary subconscious mind might have interpreted that sensation as fear.
 

 
After all, feeling a chill while facing a dangerous figure is a normal physiological response.
 

 
But Shuyi’s subconscious wasn’t afraid.
 

 
Though she didn’t know why and didn’t dwell on the reason, she simply didn’t fear the unknown threat in front of her. It felt as if she’d faced far graver dangers countless times, confronting ruthless warlords or shielding the defenseless from gunfire. Her principle was always to stand on the side of the vulnerable, of reason, and of justice.
 

 
Any physiological reactions the crew tried to trigger in her to provoke confusion or fear couldn’t stir even a hint of dread in her.
 

 
Not only did she refuse to retreat—she took a step forward and asked:
 

 
“Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want?”
# Chapter89
Who am I?
 

 
Where am I?
 

 
What should I do?
 

 
If this isn't an interrogation of a criminal, these three questions could even be quite philosophical, like the question a teacher asks students when choosing a career — what are your life goals? You probably need to first understand why we live before talking about life goals, and that's a never-ending question, something that could make you think for three hours while sitting on the toilet. Fortunately, most of us don't overthink it. Instead, we straightforwardly fill in a university's name as our life goal, and for work, there's a standard, one-size-fits-all answer: become a government official.
 

 
Unfortunately, Jiang Dang, the actor playing Fu Xuancheng, belongs to the type of person who tends to overthink.
 

 
Faced with this inquiry, he began thinking!
 

 
But while thinking, he also spoke: "You can dodge my throwing knives. You're not an ordinary person."
 

 
Shuyi denied it: "I'm just an ordinary college student with good physical fitness."
 

 
"Really? I don't believe it."
 

 
After saying that, Fu Xuancheng let go of the poor professor, his figure blurred, and in an instant, he was in front of Shuyi.
 

 
In films, the things martial arts can do are exaggerated for effect.
 

 
But the fundamentals remain the same.
 

 
It's like actors learning to swim—though the butterfly stroke remains the same, in an action movie, they can swim with the speed of a speedboat. Fu Xuancheng was fast, but Shuyi wasn’t slow either. Her dynamic vision clearly tracked his approaching trajectory, and she seized his arm, throwing him to the ground…
 

 
Without the support of a stunt module, Fu Xuancheng had the strength and speed, but he was unable to react in time or use his "high-level martial arts" to counter.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's mood was one of shock.
 

 
However, since his emotions and expressions often went off-kilter, his cold and handsome face remained calm as he looked up at Shuyi from below.
 

 
Shu Yi: "Please answer my question."
 

 
In the gentlest and most polite tone, she did the most brutal thing.
 

 
When investigating abused animals that couldn’t speak, Shu Yi frequently used her self-created "physical interrogation" method to get answers. After all, gentleness and respect are reserved for those who deserve it, while unrepentant criminals don’t need such treatment… In this regard, she might be a little "immoral."
 

 
...
 

 
The template master was sweating nervously: "This isn't working. Conventional reasons can’t deter Tong Zhao. She’s not afraid of the villain at all."
 

 
Does this scene need to be reshot?
 

 
A reshoot might make it even worse, since something that wasn’t scary the first time will only seem even more indifferent the second time in such a short period.
 

 
So, they had to give the villain a reason not to take action against the protagonist.
 

 
The sunset's fading glow cast its light over the two of them.
 

 
Director Shi thought for a moment: "If physiological reactions can't affect Tong Zhao, let's have the villain make the first move. Could that make Fu Xuancheng feel something for the protagonist?"
 

 
Other staff members exchanged looks of disbelief, thinking, ‘Is that even possible?’
 

 
No wonder he's a veteran director with experience in over ten instinctual films; his ability to think on his feet is outstanding.
 

 
Template Master: "I'll give it a try."
 

 
After all, there's nothing more difficult than manipulating Tong Zhao's subconscious!
 

 
---
 

 
Fu Xuancheng froze for about two or three seconds, while Shuyi kept her knee pressed on his arm. She turned to the professor and asked, "Professor, did he do anything to you?"
 

 
In Shuyi's mind, this was simply a villain attacking a university professor.
 

 
The professor's voice trembled, mixed with confusion: "He asked me to write a calligraphy for him, the content was 'Dugu Qiubai'..."
 

 
---
 

 
Where did this "garden baby" come from? Shuyi was speechless.
 

 
Then, the temporary code input by the template master took effect. Fu Xuancheng, who had been staring at Shuyi in astonishment, suddenly felt his heartbeat race and dopamine rush through him, making him feel a nonsensical sense of happiness. Under the influence of the bridge effect and dopamine, he couldn’t help but raise his left hand, which was not being controlled, to touch his chest to confirm the change in his heartbeat, but Shuyi, quick to react, caught his other hand.
 

 
Shuyi narrowed her eyes slightly.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, looking somewhat shy, said, "Do you want to hold my hand?"
 

 
In the back, the original partner Cheng Siwen, who had been watching this from the start: "?"
 

 
He thought this warrior had a problem, and it was a big one!
 

 
The crew didn’t expect this.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had mostly played the second male lead in idol dramas before, typically as the villain, where all he needed to do was display his handsome, wicked-looking face and deliver his lines. He didn’t need to immerse himself deeply into the role, nor had he ever tried to make the audience feel the rush of love through physiological means.
 

 
Everyone was caught off guard by how this guy was reacting...
 

 
Shuyi furrowed her brows: "I don’t want you to move around. I’ll tell the police later."
 

 
"No," Fu Xuancheng refused. "Although you're very cute, I can't let the police catch me."
 

 
After subduing the villain, a normal person's rational response would be to call the police immediately.
 

 
However, Shuyi’s subconscious was a bit different. She was more concerned with another matter: "Then tell me your purpose."
 

 
"You know martial arts. I can’t tell what style it is, but you practice well."
 

 
Fu Xuancheng's lips curled into an ambiguous smile, even a little flirtatious, as though he'd finally found someone special in a sea of people, and that someone was like him. Was there anything more joyful than this? Probably not.
 

 
He continued to speak to himself:
 

 
"I didn’t expect the person I was looking for to be such a young girl. Who's your master? I'd like to spar with you properly, but this place is obviously not suitable." He wore an expression of regret.
 

 
"I don’t know martial arts. I just have a healthy exercise routine.”
 

 
Shuyi emphasized again.
 

 
By pure chance, Shuyi's curiosity was piqued by this neurotic person who loved to chat a lot and make grand gestures. Her intuition told her that this was no ordinary madman. The two of them were about to continue talking, but at that moment, Cheng Siwen once again displayed his exceptional potential as a tool man. He...
 

 
He secretly sent a WeChat message to his classmates, asking them to bring over more security guards.
 

 
At this moment, with both the villain and the protagonist acting out at the same time, what a rare "normal person" Cheng Siwen was! The crew couldn’t help but sigh in relief, thinking that simplicity and peace are truly a blessing. The combination of a madman and a master of conversation could easily turn an action movie into a philosophical art film.
 

 
As the villain, Fu Xuancheng had much higher combat power than the protagonist in the early stages.
 

 
This could make up for his lack of technique.
 

 
Excited, he finally broke free from Shuyi's control and rolled over to engage in the first fight scene with her —
 

 
It was like an impromptu free-fight match without any weight class. Shuyi didn't want to kill him, and Fu Xuancheng didn't want to hurt her either, so the fight wasn't full of deadly blows. Instead, it was quite a spectacle. Her movements were agile, and despite her opponent having a slight physical advantage, she didn't fall behind. After being knocked down once, before Fu Xuancheng could take advantage of the situation, she performed a light and nimble kip-up, her waist arching as she sprung up. The short white T-shirt she wore lifted slightly, revealing a toned and tight abdomen, showcasing her strength and beauty.
 

 
---
 

 
The action choreographer's eyes remained glued to the scene, afraid to blink in case he missed even a moment: "Her moves are so perfect, no wonder she was personally trained by her master. Compared to her, Jiang Dang is just using brute force with the help of the coded 'golden finger.'"
 

 
The supervisor shifted his gaze to the director.
 

 
The one most passionate about action scenes here was Director Shi.
 

 
"I can't wait to start editing," Director Shi said, indicating that even he was impressed by Tong Zhao's fight scenes.
 

 
The raw, unedited footage looked a little chaotic because the real fight was intense, every punch landing with force, creating an exhilarating feeling. But through camera work and some montage techniques, they could highlight the elegant beauty of the movements.
 

 
However, they didn’t have much time to enjoy the fight scene. The security guards Cheng Siwen had called for were almost there. The two fighters heard the approaching footsteps in the hallway and the students' insistent calls: "Yes, it's this way!"
 

 
Fu Xuancheng didn’t give her a chance to stop him. He quickly closed the distance, jumped lightly to the window, and as he did, he casually yanked out the hair tie holding her ponytail.
 

 
The hair tie fell into his hand, and Shuyi’s long hair tumbled down, the strands fanning out in an arc, unknowingly providing the director with a perfect shot. She looked up at him, and the disheveled hair added a softness to her previously cold demeanor.
 

 
Her coat fluttered in the wind, and the sunset had completely set behind the mountains.
 

 
The darkness swallowed half of his face, but the eye on his right side locked onto Shuyi: "Unfortunately, this is where our fight ends today. But I’m sure... you’re one of the people I’ve been looking for. I hope the next time we meet, we can fight until one of us is dead."
 

 
?
 

 
Wasn’t it supposed to be a light sparring?
 

 
Fu Xuancheng: "You must be a martial arts genius, just like me."
 

 
Shuyi: "..."
 

 
Favorability: -1-1-1.
 

 
She was too tired to explain that she was simply good at sports and had no martial arts skills at all!
 

 
With time running out, Fu Xuancheng kissed the hair tie, then leaped away with light steps, disappearing from the third floor.
 

 
The security guards and classmates almost arrived at the same time.
 

 
Cheng Siwen, who had gotten up from the back row, tugged at his girlfriend’s hand with a resentful expression, feeling a bit green, but Shuyi quickly reassured him with a few words, lifting his spirits again. He then turned his attention to another matter: "By the way, Guiya, so you’re really that good at fighting? What you used just now was Xingyi Quan, right?"
 

 
"It was the military boxing taught during military training."
 

 
"I saw it clearly—it wasn’t military boxing..."
 

 
"Then you must have seen it wrong."
 

 
Shuyi said decisively, her firm expression convincing her boyfriend.
 

 
...
 

 
At this point, the plot had already taken off like a wild horse, never to return.
 

 
But the protagonist was still doing what they were supposed to be doing, walking down what seemed to be the right path.
 

 
After a discussion, the core team of the crew felt that the changes were acceptable. Aside from the writer feeling a little emotionally slighted, the plot was moving forward as planned, and the three lead actors had unexpected interactions and chemistry. The key was that there were several scenes that the director thought would be a waste to reshoot. He and the team already had a rough idea for how to edit the footage in post-production.
 

 
"The only remaining issue is when to trigger Tong Zhao’s subconscious shift; there needs to be a catalyst."
 

 
As the discussion was winding down, the first portion of the shoot came to an end.
 

 
Since ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ has a significant time span within the storyline, for the health of the actors, the crew didn’t want to rush the actors and decided to set up some rest periods. The actors could wake up and rest in the studio dorms after they finished filming.
 

 
The lead actors woke up from the filming cabin.
 

 
Shuyi was a bit tired, so she directly handed over the position of the main personality to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned to her room to rest, she noticed that someone from the crew group had added her as a friend—
 

 
Jiang Dang?
 

 
He was the actor playing the antagonist.
 

 
"Why did he add me?"
 

 
After returning to her room, Tong Zhao accepted the request while casually saying this.
 

 
Consort Chen: [Maybe he wants to make a move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need for that.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Do you remember Song Wanzhuo? Maybe something happened between you two in the film, and its effect carried over into real life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment but felt that it didn’t seem quite right.
 

 
Jiang Dang wasn’t new to playing in instinct-based films; this kind of “getting into character” situation should be something he could handle himself—this was also a problem that many on-screen couples faced. The feeling of attraction generally faded away after filming wrapped: [Besides, he's the antagonist, not the male lead, and Shuyi isn't a concubine. She doesn’t “keep fish.”]
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, Director Shi sent a message and a sample file.
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [Because of adjustments to the plot, we’ve added a romantic scene between you and Jiang Dang.]
 

 
Shi Dingjun: [There’s also another plot point that will need your second type of subconscious. Can you handle it?]
 

 
...
 

 
This was actually happening.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied with a simple "Okay."
 

 
As soon as she sent the message, Jiang Dang’s WeChat call came through.
 

 
Was there something that couldn’t be typed out?
 

 
It was just a professional relationship, and Tong Zhao was a bit patient with him, so she answered the call and greeted him in a cheerful voice meant for fans: “Brother Dang, what’s up?”
 

 
Jiang Dang had debuted earlier than her, so using his full name felt a bit too unfamiliar... The entertainment industry, like any other network-based industry, often made it safe to address others with titles like "sister" or "brother."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I guess I shouldn’t be disturbing you at this time."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, indeed.
 

 
But Jiang Dang had an irresistibly seductive voice.
 

 
Even if she wasn’t a "voice person," just hearing him speak could instantly erase any irritation.
 

 
Every syllable was soft and lingering, even when he said something as ordinary as "Did you eat?" It felt like he was whispering sweet nothings. While ordinary people’s words vibrated in the ear, his voice slid past like a gentle caress...
 

 
Tong Zhao felt her ears tingle.
 

 
Jiang Dang spoke slowly, as if he couldn’t quite find the right words: "I don’t know why, but after I woke up from the cabin, I felt this strong urge to find you. I just had to find you."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't help but inwardly hiss.
 

 
Shuyi: [Is this my turn now?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Looks like our Shuyi has leveled up.]
 

 
“I wanted to ask if you have some free time. I really want to spar with you…”
 

 
It was as if he suddenly remembered something inappropriate to say, and his deep voice took on a shy tone, adding a touch of unspoken allure.
 

 
Could this be the legendary “let’s find a time to hook up” invitation?
 

 
Too direct, too forward.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect.
 

 
After all, “sex and food are human nature." While she wasn’t someone who easily got into relationships, she admired the other person’s frankness. It was a genuine, straightforward approach.
 

 
Consort Chen’s comment: [That kid, Wei, should learn from him. They could have had a couple of kids by now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What does this have to do with Zekai?]
 

 
Consort Chen smiled behind her fan and said nothing.
 

 
On the other end, Jiang Dang finally made up his mind and made a bold request to the female star he had just met:
 

 
"Would you spar with me?”
# Chapter90
“...Huh?”
 

 
Even Tong Zhao was momentarily stunned.
 

 
At her age, she had never heard of such a request.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “If you really need something, you can discuss it with your manager first.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s words were somewhat tactful.
 

 
Mainly, because the two weren’t familiar with each other, she didn’t feel comfortable suggesting that he see a psychiatrist. But based on the movie script, his desire to fight seemed to be an impulsive moment. Once he talks to his manager, he’d probably calm down and realize how ridiculous he was being.
 

 
“Could it be...”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was more confused now. “Tong Zhao, do you think I’m not worthy of being your opponent by myself, and want me to bring my manager for a two-on-one?”
 

 
...
 

 
Well, well, well. Tong Zhao silently thought to herself.
 

 
She had been trained to be professional and managed to suppress the urge to laugh, but the other personalities in her mind were on the verge of cracking up.
 

 
Before she could steady herself and speak, Jiang Dang suddenly had an epiphany: “Ah, I get it now. I knew it.”
 

 
Well, if you understand...
 

 
Jiang Dang: “You want to bring my manager in as a referee, right?”
 

 
You understand ‘nothing’!
 

 
Tong Zhao tightened her grip on the phone, her fist clenching.
 

 
“We might cause rumors if we attend the same event together, so it’s better to discuss it with the manager first.”
 

 
Her side was quite relaxed; she just needed to report things.
 

 
Her manager didn’t restrict her socializing, but the whole team worked hard for her image, so naturally, it was her responsibility to cooperate and trust them to the fullest.
 

 
“Then it’s settled. Thank you.”
 

 
After Jiang Dang finished speaking, he quickly hung up the phone.
 

 
...
 

 
Huh?
 

 
It’s settled?
 

 
What kind of train of thought does this person have?
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, are you really going to fight him?]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Fighting a demon might be worth considering.]
 

 
[No,] Tong Zhao quickly stopped the wild idea from the consort, saying: [Actually, it’s not impossible… I mean, a fight, just as practice. I’ve fought with my junior disciples in the dojo before.]
 

 
Tong Zhao mentioned it to her manager.
 

 
Sister Chu was also stunned.
 

 
However, Jiang Dang’s reputation for being unconventional in the industry wasn’t surprising. Sister Chu said on the phone, “Maybe he’s interested in you. It depends on how you feel about him. I won’t interfere with that. Although his personality is a bit odd, it’s hard to resist someone with his looks and voice.”
 

 
Jiang Dang was one of the rare amphibious artists in the younger generation. His singing was more famous than his acting, and he became famous through his music.
 

 
It was said that when he first debuted, he wasn’t as eccentric.
 

 
There was a rumor in the industry that Jiang Dang loved singing so much that his manager once told him that in order to be a professional singer, he needed to speak less and protect his voice. After two years, when he became an overnight sensation, his manager, thinking that he was now a big star and should have the image of an idol, told him that it was fine if he talked more.
 

 
Once that seal was broken, there was no turning back.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s best-selling album became a hit all across Asia.
 

 
The promotional poster for this album features him wearing a soaked white shirt, his hands cuffed with a pair of silver handcuffs, and the lower half of his face firmly restrained by a black leather muzzle designed for vicious dogs. His naturally sinister face carries an indifferent expression, as if hiding a thousand-word love song behind his dark, wet eyes. The photographer adjusted the lighting to make the faintest hint of light shine in his eyes, adding an intense, unspoken depth to the emotion, as if he were struggling to hold it in.
 

 
Later, when asked what he was thinking while shooting this poster, Jiang Dang said, “The lighting technician seemed to want to shine the light directly into my eyes. I wanted to complain to my manager, but my mouth was covered by the muzzle.”
 

 
Countless fans fantasized about what kind of charming love words this fierce dog might speak.
 

 
Who could have imagined that, in the end, it would turn into a whole lot of dog talk.
 

 
Sister Chu said she bought the album and even saved the high-definition image of the poster to send to Tong Zhao. Since entering the industry, Tong Zhao had seen so many handsome men and beautiful women that she had become somewhat numb to them. The one who most matched her aesthetic was still Han Zhi in her mind. She wasn’t particularly moved by Jiang Dang’s looks and, after the phone call earlier, she began to think that he might not be that smart.
 

 
But he wasn’t like a Husky either.
 

 
Wei Zekai had more of that Husky vibe.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head and pushed the thought aside.
 

 
...
 

 
So, what exactly was Jiang Dang’s reasoning behind making such a bold request?
 

 
At the time, he had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and the influence of his character Fu Xuancheng still lingered in his mind. However, the effect was minimal, something most actors would just ignore and laugh off. But Jiang Dang was no ordinary person. He was someone who acted on impulse, and after giving it some thought, he didn’t see anything unreasonable about the request.
 

 
A fight? What a perfectly legitimate invitation.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao "agreed" to his request, he was satisfied.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to consult with his manager, he obediently did so. — Fans liked to call him a "crazy beauty," but that wasn’t entirely accurate. Jiang Dang was actually quite willing to follow the rules; he just sometimes acted a little thoughtlessly, making him seem a bit wild in the rational, interest-driven entertainment industry.
 

 
After hearing his report, his manager fell silent for a moment. “Sorry, Jiang Dang, could you repeat what you want to do?”
 

 
He suspected his ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied in a particularly cheerful tone, “I want to spar with her!”
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, so it’s just that his artist has lost his mind. Well, that’s nothing unusual.
 

 
The manager knew he was filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ at the moment, so he advised, “Calm down. Don’t get too immersed in your character. She’s the last direct disciple of Director Deng! Even a 1.8-meter tall man can’t beat her. Have you studied martial arts?”
 

 
“Nope!” Jiang Dang replied in the same cheerful, refreshing tone.
 

 
The manager sighed heavily. “...You’ll get beaten to death!”
 

 
From his understanding of Jiang Dang, once the guy had a weird idea, he would become stubborn about it. The manager didn’t want to argue further, so he decided to find a chance to talk to Tong Zhao, pleading with her not to injure him too badly, or at least avoid hitting him in the face. If she could silence him, that would be great... No, wait, that wouldn’t work either—there was a concert scheduled mid-year, and his voice couldn’t be ruined.
 

 
Coincidentally, Jiang Dang’s manager, Aaron, had some connections with Sister Chu, so arranging this wouldn’t be a hassle.
 

 
Back to the filming work.
 

 
The actor playing the male lead’s boyfriend, Cheng Siwen, was a normal guy who didn’t have as much drama as Jiang Dang. He held a simple “the more friends, the more paths” philosophy and added Tong Zhao as a friend, then quietly laid low.
 

 
After resting for the entire day, everyone returned to holographic filming the next day, fully recharged and ready to go.
 

 
The villain Fu Xuancheng became entangled with the protagonist, played by Shuyi, and wanted to spar with her.
 

 
But she chose to blend into the crowd and avoid the fight, not even returning home.
 

 
During her entanglement with Fu Xuancheng, Shuyi, who believed that everything had an answer, proactively reached out to the so-called "martial artists." She encountered the Plum Blossom Swordsman, who, facing a midlife crisis, spoke with shining eyes when talking about his knife. He mentioned that if he saw his students studying too late and there was no one to accompany them home, he would secretly follow them using his lightness skill. Once, he was mistaken for a creepy stalker, and he had to work hard to escape the situation...
 

 
Gu Xiaopan, a descendant of the famous martial artist Jianghu Bai Xiaosheng, was a serious recluse. Even when food delivery arrived, she wouldn’t dare make eye contact with the delivery driver, insisting in her notes that the food be placed in a plastic basket by the door.
 

 
But she still knew a lot of information.
 

 
This was because Gu Xiaopan, though timid in real life, was a force to be reckoned with online.
 

 
Not only did she teach these older martial artists how to use computers and WeChat over the phone, but she also gained much information from the internet. By hacking into various surveillance systems, she narrowed down Fu Xuancheng’s movements.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan’s computer was filled with PSD files of “martial arts manuals.”
 

 
These used to be passed down only to trusted individuals.
 

 
Now, due to necessity, she had no choice but to share them, afraid that they would be lost forever.
 

 
Gu Xiaopan said, “I told the uncles and aunties that as long as the files are saved on the computer, they’ll last as long as the heavens and the earth. I have one copy on the cloud, one on the computer, and three more stored on different solid-state drives, all kept in a waterproof safe.”
 

 
Becoming a martial artist is too hard—practicing stances is no different from attending hobby classes.
 

 
After all, knowing lightness skill won’t give you extra points on the college entrance exam, and it can’t stop bullets or make you an outlaw. People like Fu Xuancheng and the protagonist are rare talents, one in a million.
 

 
The most important thing is that it doesn’t make money!
 

 
When the time and effort invested doesn’t bring proportional returns, the skill will disappear.
 

 
If no one learns it, what’s the difference from it being lost?
 

 
There are many types of urban knights, each with a different appearance.
 

 
The one thing they all have in common is their love for martial arts.
 

 
After the guerrilla warfare in the girls’ dormitory, Fu Xuancheng could no longer contain himself and made his move on Cheng Siwen.
 

 
Cheng Siwen was kidnapped to an abandoned school, where Fu Xuancheng forced him to send a message to the protagonist, luring her to come alone. After Cheng Siwen firmly refused, Fu Xuancheng had no choice but to send her a voice message—due to his father’s deliberate abuse, he hadn’t attended school much and could only recognize a few characters. At the time, he only understood the movements and principles in the secret martial arts manual.
 

 
He didn’t understand the warning left by previous masters, telling him not to learn it.
 

 
This was a turning point in the protagonist’s character arc, where, in the process of using the martial arts taught by his father to protect important people, he also came to accept that he actually loved martial arts.
 

 
As the protagonist saw her boyfriend injured, she was also provoked by Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
Just then, filming paused.
 

 
...
 

 
All the actors were still in a deep sleep, except for Tong Zhao, who had woken up.
 

 
A staff member thoughtfully handed her a warm towel to wipe her face. “In ten minutes, we’ll need to put your consciousness back into the scene. Do you need more time to prepare?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head. “I’m ready anytime.”
 

 
In stark contrast to Tong Zhao's full confidence, the director, assistant director, and the supervisor who ultimately supported the decision were all, without exception, extremely nervous, sweating with anxiety, worried that the desired effect wouldn’t be achieved. The assistant director comforted them, saying, “Even if it doesn't work out, the result will just be more ordinary, but not bad. Did you think the first half of the film was bad?”
 

 
“Of course it wasn’t bad.”
 

 
Shuyi portrayed a character who possessed extraordinary martial arts skills but was calm, reserved, and had a very modern mindset.
 

 
She was easier to like than the pre-set character of Xie Guiya, and her performance was very appealing.
 

 
“But in the last third of the story…” Director Shi’s gaze shifted to the frozen surveillance footage, which was now starting a sixty-second countdown. When it hit zero, the second phase of the consciousness deployment would be complete. “I want to see a protagonist with contrast, someone whose emotions are more outwardly expressive and vivid… Seriously, can you imagine Tong Zhao’s Xie Guiya pinning someone down and beating them up? She’s the type who would call the police after subduing a criminal. It’s hard to picture her executing extrajudicial punishment.”
 

 
The assistant director nodded in agreement and teased, “I can imagine her subduing the criminal and extracting all of his past secrets and little secrets out of him.”
 

 
...
 

 
The world inside the scene resumed its motion.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng waited for a while, but when there was still no reaction from the protagonist, he shook his head in utter disappointment. “You’ve got backup waiting, don’t you?”
 

 
Previously, Shuyi had always managed to stay one step ahead and had backup ready.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng guessed that this time would be no different.
 

 
As the still image came to life again, every crew member backstage became tense, fearing that Tong Zhao, like before, would be just as clever this time, always one step ahead and avoiding the fight. In fact, if it had been any other actor, there wouldn't be such an issue because, as long as the template master adjusted the adrenaline levels, the actor would act like a firecracker ready to go off, performing in ways that were more extreme and suited for the climax of the story...
 

 
But this trick didn’t work on Tong Zhao!
 

 
They were starting to suspect that Tong Zhao had undergone some special training, allowing her to ignore any physical discomfort and always make the optimal choice, no matter the situation.
 

 
This was unbelievable.
 

 
“Backup?”
 

 
In the scene, Tong Zhao, after helping the injured Cheng Siwen to the wall, slowly repeated the words “backup” in a soft voice.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng threw her a phone from a distance, reminding her, “You can still call the police.”
 

 
The supervisor was stunned. “What the hell? When did he get a phone?”
 

 
In the film, Fu Xuancheng, who had suffered from domestic violence and was so poor he couldn’t even afford basic necessities, had never really been in contact with electronics. He was a complete tech illiterate. Moreover, at this moment, handing a phone to Tong Zhao…
 

 
The assistant director slapped his forehead, suddenly remembering that Jiang Dang’s thought process was also a bit extraordinary.
 

 
“Call the police?”
 

 
At this moment, the Tong Zhao in the scene repeated his words again.
 

 
She caught the phone Fu Xuancheng had thrown at her.
 

 
Is she really going to call the police?
 

 
Everyone couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. The supervisor turned his head irritably, unable to tolerate Tong Zhao’s overly reserved subconscious behavior. Being refined is great, but here, they needed her to explode with emotion. Why was she holding back?
 

 
However, the next development made everyone’s eyes widen in shock.
 

 
They saw Tong Zhao stand up, let go, and the phone fell to the ground.
 

 
Then, with one swift step, she stomped on the phone, crushing it with a loud, forceful sound. The glass screen slammed against the uneven floor and shattered under the pressure, glass fragments scattering all over the place.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked the glass shards aside.
 

 
The crew held their breath, and Fu Xuancheng stared at her intently.
 

 
Screenwriter: “Wait, isn’t that her boyfriend’s phone?”
 

 
Template artist: “Enough, you’ve already broken the atmosphere.”
 

 
Fu Xuancheng stared at her for a moment, then asked:
 

 
“You clearly have excellent martial arts skills, yet you always avoid confrontation. Why?”
 

 
The crew members realized with a sinking feeling that, based on Tong Zhao’s subconscious behavior earlier, this was a sign that she was about to have a conversation!
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head and looked up.
 

 
The moonlight fell into her eyes, shattering into pieces.
 

 
Her delicate face showed no smile, and her facial features were tense and sharp, forming cold, ruthless lines.
 

 
No words were necessary— even through the cold screen, every viewer could feel her anger.
 

 
The template artist silently gasped in shock, quickly checking the backstage data to see if he had administered too much hormone to her. How was the effect so strong? But no, the data clearly showed that the dosage was appropriate, just enough to make an average worker—who would normally endure a 996 work schedule—stand up to his boss and argue reasonably.
 

 
But it shouldn’t have made her look like she was ready to kill someone, right?
 

 
In the next moment, the Tong Zhao on the surveillance footage lunged forward!
# Chapter91
Is this really the same person?
 

 
At this moment, both the crew and the villain were questioning their very souls.
 

 
The final battle had a pre-set action template, designed so that "once the mind makes a move, the brain and body already have a complete set of actions ready." It's like playing a video game where, after thousands of rounds, certain combos like "a1, a3, a3" become instinctive—no thinking required, just ensuring a spectacular performance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Fu Xuancheng flying!
 

 
The director, still somewhat composed, said, "It's okay, we were always going to adjust many of the camera angles in post-production. This moment is quite impactful."
 

 
The action designer had also prepared many templates to guide him.
 

 
In short, the movie crew had gone to great lengths to ensure that an actor who had never studied martial arts could still pull off a thrilling action scene. It was almost like playing a rhythm game, but the tricky part was that Tong Zhao didn't play by the usual rules... her subconscious mind had actual skills! The fight scenes she delivered were truly hard-hitting and incredibly impressive!
 

 
But directing her—well, that was both a painful and thrilling challenge.
 

 
So, what did the action designer do?
 

 
Of course, he didn’t give up!
 

 
"Alright, Fu Xuancheng being kicked away was within my calculations," said the action designer for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ as his fingers flew over the control panel, so fast that his fingers blurred. "I anticipated that Tong Zhao's subconscious wouldn't follow the plan, so I prepared several backup options just waiting for her to make her move!"
 

 
Everyone else looked at him with admiration.
 

 
Now ‘that’ is professionalism.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng, who had been kicked away, took less than a second to recover and switch to a defensive stance, preparing to strike. However, Tong Zhao was even faster. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, she appeared right in front of him. Fu Xuancheng's heart raced—there was no time to dodge!
 

 
Outside the scene, the action designer smirked coldly. "Don’t underestimate my reaction speed. I played professional e-sports for a year!"
 

 
The action coding input in the backstage system would precede the brain's instructions—this is what’s known as a "subconscious action." This type of movement doesn’t appear often in regular dramatic scenes, as actors might start doubting their mental state if it happens too frequently, potentially hindering the performance. However, in high-frequency action scenes, there's no such worry. Fu Xuancheng would only think that his experience made him so skilled that his body instinctively reacted before his mind could process it.
 

 
With the action designer’s help, Fu Xuancheng narrowly sidestepped, avoiding a fatal strike. Only his shoulder was hit.
 

 
It was a wooden sword, but the dull pain it caused was no less intense than that of a metal blade.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng’s entire body tensed as he lowered his stance, locking eyes with her.
 

 
Unexpectedly, she didn’t go for a quick attack. Instead, she stood still, glancing up at Fu Xuancheng, her hand still gripping the wooden sword.

Within the story, Duan Ge, upon regaining consciousness, received the full character memory.
 

 
Duan Ge had never been a mindless killer. On the contrary, leading her companions to survive in the post-apocalyptic world required constant avoidance of conflict, only striking decisively and precisely when absolutely necessary. Killing one person should be equivalent to killing ten—she wasn’t a sadist. However, the personality shaped by extreme conditions didn’t quite fit with the peaceful times.
 

 
Let me give an example.
 

 
In peaceful times, an ordinary person, when enraged to the point of explosion, would slap someone across the face.
 

 
In extreme conditions, Duan Ge, when enraged to the point of explosion, would want to knock someone’s head off and kick it like a soccer ball.
 

 
Right now, Duan Ge really wanted to twist off the head of the person who had hurt her boyfriend and kick it around.
 

 
“You’ve asked for a fight again and again.”
 

 
“To be honest, I don’t like martial arts at all, and I despise violence. I can’t understand creatures like you who take pleasure in combat.”
 

 
“Alright then…”
 

 
She stretched her arms and then, with her palm facing up, made a beckoning gesture at him.
 

 
“I’ll let you experience the essence of traditional martial arts—until you’re dead.”
 

 
As she spoke, Duan Ge smiled.
 

 
The curve at the corner of her eyes was both charming and violent.

Whenever action scenes appeared, it was the time for the action designer to shine.
 

 
Everyone else could only remain quiet and try not to disturb his work.
 

 
“Hmph, just you, Tong Zhao, I’ll see how you fight me!”
 

 
“Ah, hasn’t Jiang Dang’s physical condition been enhanced? Why is he still so weak?”
 

 
“Template designer, template designer, can you adjust the backstage data again? Oh, and how about activating a blood lock cheat for him!”
 

 
The entire backstage was filled with the increasingly insane and unreasonable demands from the action designer.
 

 
The template designer weakly raised his hand. “Uh, it’s already set to the maximum. I really can’t activate any more cheats…”
 

 
The action designer couldn’t believe it.
 

 
Even with his help, Fu Xuancheng still couldn’t defeat Tong Zhao!
 

 
How could there be a female star with such superior combat skills?
 

 
Does this girl really just run errands for her schedule instead of competing in mixed martial arts?
 

 
A deep sense of defeat enveloped him.
 

 
In front of him stood a mountain called Tong Zhao, one that he could only look up to, but could never overcome.
 

 
---
 

 
Because the movie’s main character, while searching for information on the villain, had come across many martial arts secrets, greatly enhancing her strength, she had also begun to accept this “family tradition.” She had studied longer than Fu Xuancheng, who started later, but had always been unwilling to admit that she was so powerful.
 

 
The first two-thirds of the story were about “this protagonist being incredibly strong yet overly cautious.”
 

 
And the climax, when it finally erupted, was especially satisfying.
 

 
And the villain? The villain was the one who made the audience feel good.
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was beaten half to death, and Duan Ge was injured a bit.
 

 
The action designer, who initially wanted to manipulate the villain to defeat the protagonist, then aimed for a draw, and in the end, compromised to the humble goal of "don't ruin that handsome face..."
 

 
Duan Ge handed Fu Xuancheng over to the police, and before leaving, he grabbed her hand. "Didn’t we agree to fight until one of us dies?"
 

 
"The times have changed, big bad wolf."
 

 
Duan Ge tilted her head and gave him a heroic smile.
 

 
---
 

 
Later, because Fu Xuancheng didn’t actually kill anyone and was a minor (Duan Ge: "He’s that young???"), the authorities chose to let him off lightly. A relevant organization helped him return to school, saying he wanted to be the protagonist’s junior and wanted to pursue her.
 

 
Duan Ge said: "With your IQ, that’s unlikely, but you can come to my martial arts school to become my disciple."
 

 
After much consideration, the protagonist reconciled with her father and decided to take over the martial arts school.
 

 
One person couldn’t handle it alone, so Jianghu informant Gu Xiaopan (who had previously been at home) found another place to squat—she came to her martial arts school. Together, they began researching whether traditional martial arts could be adapted into a more manageable version—one that was less grueling but still strong for the body.
 

 
In the torrent of the times, what gets washed away isn’t necessarily the weak or unworthy, but more likely what doesn’t fit the new era’s standards. It’s still good. The protagonist resisted martial arts because what her father taught her was in stark contrast to what she was taught in school. As a young child, she was like a diode, and she firmly believed that it should be discarded.
 

 
After a series of dangerous yet somewhat amusing events, the protagonist came to terms with two things in her heart.
 

 
The story ended on a satisfying note.
 

 
The screenwriter was at a loss for words: "Although... but... however..."
 

 
What should he say?
 

 
The ending was fitting.
 

 
But it seemed like the process had nothing to do with what he originally wrote.
 

 
A huge sense of disappointment enveloped him, but thinking about the payment that had already been deposited into his account made it feel a bit better. After all, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t a film that focused on the screenwriter; everything was based on whether Director Shi Dingjun was satisfied, and it seemed like he couldn’t wait to start editing the final cut.
 

 
Unlike traditional films, the most tedious part of instinct films was the pre-production and post-editing. The actual filming with the actors was much quicker.
 

 
Everyone was celebrating the successful conclusion.
 

 
Indeed, the joys and sorrows of people do not really connect!
 

 
As the screenwriter reflected in his melancholy, his gaze met that of the action designer, who was sitting dejectedly. In that brief moment when their eyes locked, it felt like two lonely whales tuning into the same wavelength. They shared a common formidable opponent. Even though the work had come to a satisfying conclusion, they couldn’t feel happiness—only overwhelming defeat. Their gazes seemed to offer each other solace, almost sparking something…
 

 
But it really felt way too ‘gay’.
 

 
The two, who were both very rigid in terms of their inclinations, simultaneously turned away with expressionless faces.
 

 
How should one describe this feeling?
 

 
It’s like the screenwriter playing mid-lane, and Tong Zhao playing jungle. The jungle keeps taking all the screen time from the mid-lane, and in the end, Tong Zhao economically dominates, carrying the whole game and easily securing the star of the match. Meanwhile, the screenwriter just coasts along, winning without contributing much, and ends up being slaughtered by the enemy team…
 

 
Did they win the game?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
Are the teammates happy?
 

 
Yes!
 

 
But him? 0/22/0, face down in defeat, with no game experience.
 

 
Not only unhappy, but a bit wronged as well.
 

 
"If it weren't for Tong Zhao being so tired, I’d really want to go over the replay with her."
 

 
"Yeah, I didn’t expect her subconscious to have such explosive power."
 

 
The crew excitedly discussed the raw footage.
 

 
Movies are ultimately art and need to be exaggerated, but sometimes instinctive films can be too realistic and fail to achieve those exaggerated twists. Tong Zhao’s subconscious, though, pulled it off! It was like the saying, "You look five pounds heavier on camera." If she looks so slim on screen, how thin must she be in real life? This led to a discussion about Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
The stagehand said, “But I think Xiao Zhao is really friendly.”
 

 
“Yeah, she’s just an ordinary person. Except for being a bit quiet, she doesn’t put on airs.”
 

 
“I’m a fan of hers…”
 

 
The screenwriter felt that his friendship with the template designer had reached its end.
 

 
No, there was still one person—this person’s feelings should be just like his!
 

 
The screenwriter thought of Jiang Dang, who had been beaten up badly.
 

 
Well, once Jiang Dang regains his memories from the film, maybe he should chat with him for a bit.
 

 
---
 

 
Since she had to rush off for other engagements, Tong Zhao didn’t stay long in Qin City after waking up from the cabin. She took the earliest flight back to the company, and as soon as she landed, she was taken to the studio to shoot for a magazine cover. Jiang Dang, on the other hand, had three days off and spent a whole night resting at the Qin City Film Studio. At the celebration banquet, he finally met the screenwriter, who seemed eager to talk.
 

 
The screenwriter had deliberately arranged to sit next to him and said, "Sigh, it seems like you’re the only one who understands how I feel!"
 

 
Jiang Dang nodded, "Yes, we're both eating steamed bass."
 

 
---
 

 
The screenwriter was exasperated, "I mean ‘feelings’."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked back at him honestly, "Is there something different about your bass?"
 

 
The table just happened to have a big dish of steamed bass, and they coincidentally both took a bite. Wasn’t it the "same feeling"? The screenwriter remembered the rumors about Jiang Dang’s unusual thought process, but in the entertainment industry, he always only believed half of the rumors: "Maybe I wasn’t clear earlier. I mean the feeling of you being beaten half to death by Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jiang Dang’s expression subtly changed.
 

 
Seeing this, the screenwriter immediately got excited.
 

 
"Right? I hit a nerve, didn’t I?"
 

 
"Let’s hug and cry together, licking each other’s wounds!"
 

 
"Has she hit you before?" Jiang Dang asked, his gaze darkening slightly, a bit inexplicably displeased.
 

 
The screenwriter was taken aback. "No, not really."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Jiang Dang leisurely picked up a piece of tender bass, dipped it in white sugar, and ate it. His devilishly handsome side profile and elegant eating style couldn’t suppress the screenwriter's sense of nausea at seeing this scene… Maybe the problem with this guy wasn’t his thought process, but his taste buds.
 

 
The screenwriter decided to get to the point. "Doesn't it hurt, getting beaten like that by her?"
 

 
After chewing slowly and savoring, Jiang Dang turned his gaze back to him.
 

 
Jiang Dang had eyes that were as steady as a rock in a world of vanity, with a heart that seemed to hold deep thoughts and layers of meaning, not a complaint like "I can't believe bass goes with sugar—this is so gross, I got duped again."
 

 
The screenwriter felt his heart skip a beat under his gaze.
 

 
No wonder he was called the "godly face" of the music industry... Unlike when he looked at the action designer, this time the screenwriter felt that sexual orientation didn’t need to be so rigid. If the person in question was Jiang Dang, he could be flexible!
 

 
"It doesn’t hurt," Jiang Dang said with a slight curve of his lips, his eyes flashing with a mad excitement. "I actually like it. I want her to hit me again. You said our feelings are the same... Do you want to have a spar with her too? If you really want it, I can help you get in touch with her manager, but whether she agrees is up to her."
 

 
---
 

 
"No thanks."
 

 
"I don’t mean to monopolize her, you know."
 

 
Seeing the change in the screenwriter’s expression, Jiang Dang thought maybe his face was too intimidating. He tried to soften his tone.
 

 
"Mm, mm, really no need, thank you, thank you."
 

 
---
 

 
The screenwriter turned to the modeling supervisor and asked, "Can we switch seats?"
# Chapter92
While others were celebrating, Tong Zhao was still hard at work.
 

 
After two non-stop days, her assistant was so exhausted that every step felt like walking on clouds, stumbling along in a daze. It was no surprise—Tong Zhao, a superstar like her, setting aside an entire month to focus on rigorous training was incredibly rare. It showed a deep love for her craft and earned her praise within the film industry, as well as approval from critics.
 

 
After all, in both traditional and instinctive cinema, audiences ultimately want to see actors put themselves through the wringer in the name of "artistic dedication."
 

 
Many times, Tong Zhao suggested her assistant go home and get some rest.
 

 
The assistant firmly refused, saying, "If Sister Zhao isn't resting, how can I?"
 

 
"I could go a whole week without sleep."
 

 
Tong Zhao, having only slept four hours in the past two days, shot her a look. Her small, sharp face looked as energetic as if she'd had a full eight hours of sleep, making the assistant almost believe that people might not need sleep after all. "Sister Zhao, stop joking. Let’s get through this last set of shots, and then we can go home and rest."
 

 
"Alright," Tong Zhao replied, closing her eyes again.
 

 
This shoot had a rugged, cold theme, requiring her to wear military fatigues and give the camera a fierce expression. For her, it was effortless—no acting required, just posing naturally. Since she started training in spiritual cultivation, she barely needed sleep, but the less she slept, the worse her mood got...
 

 
Before shooting, Tong Zhao sat fully equipped in a corner, completely uninterested in interacting with anyone. Sunglasses and mask on, she looked like a mysterious character.
 

 
Over time, with the success of one hit film after another, Tong Zhao’s status in the industry had quietly risen.
 

 
She now had every right to assert herself.
 

 
Of course, in the entertainment world, even her modest setup wasn’t anything remarkable. Though she had graciously treated the entire crew to milk tea upon arriving at the studio, the gesture didn't really sway opinions much. For her, it wasn’t worth the energy to manage her image too meticulously.
 

 
In fact, at times, letting people assume she had a bit of a temper wasn’t such a bad thing.
 

 
Now, the staff around her recognized her growing influence and quietly adjusted, moving more carefully, keeping conversations low, not wanting to disrupt her. This unspoken courtesy allowed Tong Zhao to relax and rest for a moment.
 

 
After finishing the photoshoot, Tong Zhao removed her makeup and, too tired to trek back to her faraway apartment, decided to check into a bay-view suite at a nearby Hilton. She went straight to sleep, planning to figure out her next move when she woke up.
 

 
After she woke up, her agent called, asking where she was.
 

 
When Tong Zhao answered, Sister Chu chuckled, "Good choice of room—I was just about to discuss a little matter with you."
 

 
It turned out to be about housing.
 

 
With Tong Zhao's rapid rise in the industry, her current single apartment—which was perfectly fine for a newcomer—was no longer suitable. For both her image and security, a new home was in order. "I’d wanted to bring this up for a while, but things kept getting delayed."
 

 
As status rises, so must every aspect of one’s lifestyle—housing, clothing, transportation.
 

 
"No problem."
 

 
After a short understanding reply, Tong Zhao got up from bed. "Arrange someone to take me to check out some homes. I’d rather not pick out an entire neighborhood myself."
 

 
Sister Chu laughed, "Of course, I'll make sure you’re set up with something excellent."
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished washing up and applying a bit of makeup for going out, the driver and entourage were already waiting downstairs.
 

 
The property Sister Chu selected for her was a single-unit-per-floor high-rise in a prime location with first-class security and privacy. Naturally, the price and maintenance fees were steep, but at this point, they were necessities for Tong Zhao, who was never one to shortchange herself.
 

 
The new property was a massive flat with eight rooms and four living areas.
 

 
The sales agent, sharp-eyed and professional, emphasized the privacy features of Yu Long Xuan and the in-house cleaning team, which could be used for an additional fee. This way, there was no need to risk hiring unreliable outside services. He added with a smile, “And even if someone hires an external cleaning service, it’d be difficult for them to get in here without being escorted by the owner or tenant.”
 

 
Tong Zhao believed him.
 

 
Just getting in herself had felt like passing through multiple security gates.
 

 
After viewing the property, she was thoroughly satisfied and didn’t feel the need to shop around further—she went straight ahead and paid the down payment.
 

 
In fact, she could afford to pay the full price by cashing out some of her shares and investments. But rather than pay all at once, she preferred to let that few million yuan work for her, earning returns instead of saving a bit of interest.
 

 
"Whew..."
 

 
Now all that was left was arranging for the moving company.
 

 
Once the paperwork was done, she could move in as soon as the master bedroom was ready; it would definitely be more comfortable than a hotel.
 

 
Relieved, Tong Zhao shared the news with her friends in a group chat: "I’m officially someone with a mortgage now!"
 

 
Friend A: "Sounds so novel—I want to try it too."
 

 
Friend B: "Can’t wait to visit your new place, Zhao!"
 

 
Friend C: "Where’d you buy it?"
 

 
After chatting and laughing with them for a while, she messaged Wei Zekai privately, who had been trying to play dead: "Stop pretending. What's your connection to Yu Long Xuan?"
 

 
Good properties usually sold out before construction was even complete.
 

 
The unit Tong Zhao bought had never been lived in—it was brand new.
 

 
Although Yu Long Xuan was absurdly expensive, it was considered “prime real estate,” targeted toward the city’s wealthy residents. And the city was not short of wealthy people. Although Sister Chu had plenty of influence in the entertainment industry, this deal went beyond her reach. So Tong Zhao suspected Wei Zekai had something to do with it. After the incident with ‘Neptune Hunt’ and the previous rumors, her manager still had his contact info.
 

 
Wei Zekai confessed honestly: "My uncle is in real estate, and I asked Sister Chu if you needed to move. When Yu Long Xuan was finished, we set aside a batch of the best units, which weren’t publicly available. Don’t be mad."
 

 
Her manager probably just thought she’d recommended a decent property.
 

 
Little did she know it’d rack up such a big favor.
 

 
"I’m not mad; I should’ve asked you, honestly. You know this stuff better." Tong Zhao wasn’t one to fuss over debts with someone who genuinely cared for her. Besides, she and her childhood friend had built up so many mutual favors over the years that there was no point in keeping score.
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Know it better, my ass! I don’t know real estate."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "So, what do you know?"
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Entrepreneurship!"
 

 
…
 

 
Sometimes, Tong Zhao found it hard to tell if he was joking or dead serious.
 

 
In any case, the moving company quickly transported her belongings from the old apartment to her new home. With the numerous layers of paperwork and approvals involved in buying a luxury home, word about her purchase inevitably leaked to the media. Considering her current film fees and endorsement income, it was clear that purchasing a luxury property like Yu Long Xuan was a bit of a stretch for her budget.
 

 
Experts among the public didn’t take long to calculate her approximate income and compare it to the price of the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan.
 

 
The gap was at least several million yuan.
 

 
On Weibo and various forums, netizens were buzzing with surprise at her extravagant spending.
 

 
- “My whole family is shocked by her wealth—how can she have so much money?”
 

 
- “The genre of ‘immersive cinema’ is a huge market—either you profit big or lose big. Tong Zhao’s films have all been hits, and her pay rate must be sky-high by now. Her fan base alone wouldn’t cover this; it’s really her good relationship with audiences and her knack for picking the right projects.”
 

 
- “Sure, the A1 unit in Yu Long Xuan is expensive, but there’s no rule saying she had to pay it all at once! If it’s just the down payment, her income could definitely cover it.”
 

 
Up to this point, the discussion remained positive.
 

 
But it’s the internet—how long can that positivity really last?
 

 
Faced with an apparently perfect celebrity, some netizens started saying, “Really? I don’t believe it,” digging deep for anything suspicious. They uncovered a leak from the bank confirming that Tong Zhao had taken a mortgage rather than paying in full.
 

 
Netizens began wondering why she’d need such a large place.
 

 
-“Maybe she’s just used to living in luxury. When she left her family, she moved from a mansion to a low-cost apartment.”
 

 
- “And now, she’s worked her way back up to an even better mansion! So inspiring, Zhao Zhao! [crying emoji]”
 

 
- “I wish her lousy dad could see this.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming did see it.
 

 
It was hard to miss—even though he only read print newspapers, he couldn’t escape news about his eldest daughter’s latest movie. There was even a giant billboard across from his company featuring her face, all made up and strikingly beautiful, seeming to look down on his business. Every time he saw it, it irritated him to the point where just the sight of Xu Zhu bothered him.
 

 
How could two children from the same family turn out so different?
 

 
Tong Zhenming couldn’t figure it out.
 

 
When he couldn’t make sense of it, he’d go home and take his frustrations out on Xu Zhu, sometimes even physically, though he had held back recently, as her wedding was coming up. She was marrying into the He family; their young master had few options after experiencing a strange wave of setbacks in business. Faced with her father’s plan to marry her off as the second wife of a wealthy older businessman, Xu Zhu settled on the He family as a last resort.
 

 
To support the marriage alliance, Tong Zhenming bought her an apartment, fully paid as part of her dowry.
 

 
Since paparazzi couldn’t dig up any new stories on Tong Zhao, they turned their focus to the father-daughter duo. Even a single unpleasant comment from them would make a juicy headline.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was moving around like an urban hermit, as though in hiding. She had already completed her publicity tour and magazine covers, leaving her largely untraceable while public interest in her was at a fever pitch.
 

 
…
 

 
On Xu Zhu’s wedding dress shopping day, she barely made it out of the store when three people jumped out from the roadside.
 

 
“Xu Zhu, I’m a reporter from Papaya Media. I have a few questions for you.”
 

 
Xu Zhu had never experienced anything like this and clung to her father’s arm in fright.
 

 
When she had been an idol, she hadn’t been particularly famous; the few interviews she had were orchestrated by the company to generate hype.
 

 
“What are you doing!” Tong Zhenming snapped, his eyes flashing with anger.
 

 
Normally, Tong Zhenming wouldn’t accompany Xu Zhu on outings. But today, he planned to take her for wedding dress shopping and then join the He family for a dinner between the two families, so he decided to come along. Little did he know this would land him in hot water.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhenming there too, the three paparazzi reporters became even more excited, their eyes lighting up as if they’d struck gold.
 

 
“What are your thoughts on Tong Zhao buying a high-end A1 unit at Yu Long Xuan after publicly severing your father-daughter relationship?” one reporter fired off rapidly. “Are you considering helping her out financially?”
 

 
The public announcement of his estrangement from his eldest daughter had been one of the most humiliating moments of Tong Zhenming’s life. His expression changed instantly. “Are you crazy? What she does has nothing to do with me. I don’t acknowledge her as my daughter! Why should I support her?”
 

 
People who aren’t used to dealing with the media often get caught off guard. Whether they deny or react with shock, it just creates more material for journalists to exploit.
 

 
Sensing a newsworthy moment, one reporter gave a sly smile and added fuel to the fire. “That’s quite a statement. By the way, is it true that Miss Xu Zhu is getting married soon?” he asked, noticing they had just stepped out of a lavish bridal boutique. “Just curious—are you being fair in providing dowries?”
 

 
Another reporter chimed in, “Tong Zhao is paying off her house through a mortgage.”
 

 
Their questions were loaded with insinuations and structured to provoke, giving Tong Zhenming little room to answer gracefully. In frustration, he raised his voice, shouting, “Impossible! Not a single cent will go to her. I only have one daughter, Zhu Zhu, and I’ve paid for her home in full.”
 

 
Xu Zhu, who had been unwillingly thrust into the spotlight, forced herself to smile and nod for the reporters. “My father treats me very well, but support also brings responsibility. I’ll make sure to take care of him, as well as for my sister’s share,” she added sweetly.
 

 
She had no intention of being photographed looking unpleasant.
 

 
Perfect! That was exactly what the reporters wanted.
 

 
The journalists exchanged glances, and just then, the driver, who had been circling the mall for ages to find parking, finally arrived. The reporters rushed into the car as if they’d been rescued, and sped off, leaving the Tong family trio in relative peace, all of them breathing a sigh of relief.
 

 
Tong Zhenming’s round face was flushed red with anger as he continued ranting about his eldest daughter. “Always stirring up trouble! She’s the one who announced our estrangement, yet I’m the one facing all the hassles? Ridiculous! Buying a place at Yu Long Xuan—who does she think she is? And if she can’t make her mortgage payments and comes begging me, I won’t lift a finger!”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt somewhat appeased.
 

 
She wanted a place at Yu Long Xuan herself. The neighbors there were all wealthy, the ocean view was stunning, but her father wouldn’t buy one for her, and her husband’s family…well, perhaps if she gave them a son and their business continued to do well, they might buy one for her husband. But it certainly wouldn’t be in her name.
 

 
At least, her own pre-wedding home had been paid for in full.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually dared to take out a mortgage?
 

 
"Nothing blooms for a hundred days. In the entertainment industry, a star who rises to fame at the beginning of the year might already be fading by the end of it."
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched the hem of her dress, trying not to think about the possibility that the powerful Wei family’s eldest son might support ‘that’ woman financially…
 

 
If only she had the choice, she’d want to marry into the Wei family too.

"The Ultimate Triumph of the Mistress! Tong Zhenming Prepares a Full Dowry for His Youngest Daughter, Declares He Won't Give a Dime to Tong Zhao"
 

 
Bala Media, with a bit of a Hong Kong tabloid vibe, used sensationalist headlines designed to attract clicks. Known for ignoring PR maneuvers and focusing solely on what draws viewers' attention, this media outlet prioritizes shock value over integrity or morals. Their report cast Tong Zhenming and his younger daughter, born of his mistress, back into the spotlight, where netizens once again condemned them. By the time people suggested that Tong Zhenming should’ve kept quiet, it was already too late.
 

 
With a father like him, there were hardly any accusations left that painted Tong Zhao as ungrateful or extreme.
 

 
In the public eye, Tong Zhao—having to take out a loan to afford her first property without any help from her family—came across as someone to be pitied, almost tragic.
 

 
But this also posed an image problem for her.
 

 
After all, she was carving out a multi-talented career, aiming to be a figure of admiration for her fans.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao herself...
 

 
“I don’t need fans to worship me as some kind of deity, but I also don’t want anyone thinking I’m a pitiable figure,” she said coolly in a company meeting, seated at the head of the table, her sunglasses still on. Only the lower half of her face was visible—perfectly defined and framed by vivid red lips, which parted to deliver her next words calmly.
 

 
“This is the perfect opportunity to reveal that I have other businesses.”
 

 
While she would have preferred for her “past” to stay quiet, if they kept stirring things up, then she'd take advantage of the situation. No news story would bring her down, and no mud-slinging would stick to her name for more than a day.
# Chapter93
What Does It Mean to Live Well?
 

 
Throughout history, being adored by men has often been the benchmark of a woman’s success. Even a wealthy woman without a happy marriage or children isn’t seen as fully fulfilled; her "crown" seems less radiant. People may talk about her with regret, and the tabloids may mock her.
 

 
While this is the kind of lowbrow behavior we often see from certain tabloids, it reflects a deeply ingrained attitude. Many people, influenced by traditional views on fatherly or marital support, still equate a woman's security with having either a supportive father or a devoted husband. If she lacks one, people hope she at least has the other.
 

 
As a result, many of Tong Zhao's casual fans are eager to see her in a dream-like relationship, perhaps even a lavish wedding to a wealthy partner. It would be, to them, the perfect rebuttal to her neglectful father.
 

 
“Come on,” one fan wrote, “those who pity Tong Zhao clearly don’t know who her admirers are! Look at Wei Zekai’s feelings for her on that variety show. Marrying into wealth is just a matter of time.”
 

 
“Her dad? Please, everyone knows he doesn’t even deserve to shine Wei’s shoes,” another commenter added. “Honestly, I think Wei’s family has been making things difficult for the Tong family’s business lately.”
 

 
Fans spoke confidently, sometimes acting as if they knew more about her life than she did.
 

 
Some of them even used this moment to promote fan fiction, shipping Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a popular fictional pairing. From romantic stories like ‘[WeiZhao] The Joy of Our Youthful Meeting’ to comedy pieces like ‘[WeiZhao] The Playboy Meets the dog’, these stories became fan favorites, bringing people into the fandom. And surprisingly, the couple’s “evidence” wasn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
For instance, fans had uncovered Tong Zhao’s main ‘Honor of Kings’ account. Though she wasn’t a VIP player, her account had all the skins available, meaning someone had been gifting them to her. And because her intimacy level was visible to other players, it wasn’t hard for fans to connect her with Wei Zekai, whose account appeared as her top “friend,” showering her with gifts.
 

 
The two hadn’t officially announced anything, and their in-game relationship was just a blue “buddy” connection. Plus, Wei Zekai had a high intimacy score with many friends, indicating that he simply enjoyed sending gifts to everyone in his circle.
 

 
Netizens quickly uncovered that Wei’s account constantly had tens of thousands of in-game currency, which he spent generously on each new skin release, even gifting friends who didn’t actively play. Tong Zhao once commented, “It’s normal for him. Back in elementary school, he’d always buy tons of Little Raccoon noodles and hand out the collectible cards to classmates.”
 

 
It was just a sign of his generosity, not necessarily any exclusive affection.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao even had a chance to clarify, however, the group of second-generation rich friends from Wei Zekai’s circle in ZeShan Capital had already gotten a bit anxious over the gossip.
 

 
All the friends popped up in unison, quickly distancing themselves and humorously encouraging Wei Zekai to "untie himself" from any love rumors.
 

 
The first two who spoke up on Weibo were relatively subtle:
 

 
@SecondGen_A:
 
“The only single scent around here is coming from Wei Zekai. Don’t drag him into the mess of romance.”
 

 
@SecondGen_B:
 
“Pure, innocent brotherhood—can’t say it’ll stay that way, though! /dog face”
 

 
Then, things quickly took a humorous turn:
 

 
@SecondGen_C:
 
“With my brother Zekai’s emotional intelligence, getting married at 30 would still be ‘early dating’ for him!”
 

 
…
 

 
@SecondGen_E:
 
“Pick me instead! Aren’t I and Zhao Zhao legit? [Photo.JPG]”
 

 
This was a soft, sweet girl from the south with family wealth, just a notch below Wei Zekai’s in ZeShan Ventures. Her close photo with Tong Zhao set off a playful competition, with everyone, half-serious, half-joking, claiming Tong Zhao as “the best sister ever.”
 

 
Seeing the fuss, Wei Zekai couldn’t stay silent. With a strong sense of caution, he checked with Tong Zhao first to avoid saying anything that might trouble her. His thoughtfulness impressed her—he’d clearly grown a lot since his early days running ZeShan Ventures, where his emotional
 
intelligence was low, and he acted impulsively with little regard for others.
 

 
In their past life, Wei Zekai’s bluntness and Tong Zhao’s stubbornness had led to a falling-out so severe that they became estranged.
 

 
But this time, Tong Zhao smiled warmly and replied, “Hold on. You’re my trump card.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was both shocked and flattered. “Am I that important?”
 

 
“Of course.”
 

 
With all the cards in her hand, Tong Zhao controlled the game.
 

 
---
 

 
In the entertainment news, Tong Zhao took center stage, covering half the headlines. In the financial news, ZeShan Ventures was the undisputed leader.
 

 
This venture capital firm, which gained attention after investing in ‘Little Lamb Gaming’, had seen incredible profits lately. Every company they backed had turned profitable, creating groundbreaking returns, especially over the past six months, with ZeShan Ventures appearing at the forefront of the highest-return projects.
 

 
Industry insiders were baffled—could this company predict the future?
 

 
But it wasn’t just about providing funds. According to CEOs of invested companies, ZeShan’s representatives offered crucial guidance, helping them assess risks and refine their projects. Their advice was like turning stone to gold. These investors weren’t just seen as angels; they were practically revered.
 

 
And with reverence came respect—and a hint of awe.
 

 
Imagine that—a powerhouse like ZeShan Ventures guiding numerous companies to profitable outcomes naturally has ways to deal with anyone who tries to step out of line. Realizing this, the smaller companies in ZeShan's network dared not act out; instead, they obediently looked to ZeShan as the market compass, heeding their guidance on everything.
 

 
After all, they hadn’t finished raking in the profits yet.
 

 
As ZeShan's investors took the lion’s share of the profits, these partner companies also benefitted significantly, savoring the leftovers. And apart from a few key suggestions, ZeShan didn’t micromanage their operations, creating a sense of comfortable, cooperative, win-win relationships.
 

 
Several financial publications sought interviews with ZeShan’s mastermind, but every request was declined. Finally, Wei Zekai stepped in as the public face. Raised with all the privileges, he wore his suit with a natural authority and a hint of a “king of the boardroom” air—no trace of the inexperience typical of his age group. It was clear that the money the Wei family had poured into his development wasn’t wasted; his broad perspective and steady nerves were unmistakable.
 

 
A closer look at the interview content revealed that Wei Zekai was not a mere figurehead. He demonstrated full knowledge of all ZeShan’s investment projects, familiar with every detail. Yet, despite his expertise, most people still couldn’t believe he was the one providing all the critical advice and insights. His strategies seemed too forward-thinking for one so young.
 

 
Of course, both Wei Zekai and everyone at ZeShan Ventures were unanimous in maintaining that they were only executors; the real strategist behind the scenes was someone else.
 

 
Many established companies, curious about this “mastermind,” privately contacted Wei Zekai in hopes of getting in touch with this expert. But they got nowhere—any attempts were met with vague replies that this person was “too busy.”
 

 
Rumors spread, with some speculating that Wei’s conglomerate was guiding him. As industry chatter grew, ZeShan Ventures scored another major success in its latest venture. In response, China’s most respected financial magazine, ‘WeatherVane’, reached out, offering a feature story on the main cover. They were eager to uncover more exclusive information, particularly about the true identity of ZeShan’s mysterious strategist. Even an online interview would suffice if the person preferred to remain anonymous.
 

 
In the business world, idols aren’t movie stars but financial guides, those with the foresight to steer markets to profit. Whoever can make big money is, temporarily, a deity.
 

 
Surprisingly, ZeShan Ventures accepted WeatherVane's invitation.
 

 
Industry peers were quick to make snide remarks, saying the elusive mastermind wasn’t “impossible” to interview; it just took the right magazine with enough clout.
 

 
Criticism aside, anticipation was high.
 

 
Every issue of ‘WeatherVane’ attracted suit-clad professionals in convenience stores and upscale coffee shops, grabbing a copy. Typically, trendy young people weren’t interested. But with this issue, a strange phenomenon occurred.
 

 
Regardless of age or gender, people stopped when they passed the issue of ‘WeatherVane’… then stared at it, puzzled.
 

 
The background of the cover is pure black, with a high-backed leather office chair at the center. Tong Zhao is seated in the chair, her hands relaxed on the armrests. She is wearing a white custom-tailored women's suit that perfectly outlines her graceful figure. Her slightly amber eyes, faintly visible beneath her light-colored pupils, reveal a confident smile at the corners of her lips, giving off an air of someone in full control.
 

 
Since rising to fame, Tong Zhao has been a regular in major fashion magazines.
 

 
She is capable of mastering various shooting styles, which is neither uncommon nor surprising.
 

 
But can someone explain why she is on the cover of ‘WV’???
 

 
The two lines of subheadings at the bottom of the magazine gave the public an answer:
 

 
“ZeShan Investments true leader — Tong Zhao”
 

 
“New Generation Investment Trendsetter”
 

 
…
 

 
Huh?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
The direct consequence of the confusion was that even people who were not interested in finance or economics casually bought a copy, leaving many white-collar workers who were waiting for the ‘ZeShan’ interview speechless — ‘WV’ had always sold well, but not to this extent. Many had planned to buy it during their lunch break, only to find it sold out!
 

 
The news of Tong Zhao appearing on the cover of ‘WV’ quickly spread across Weibo.
 

 
Many fans who had no idea about this magazine thought it was some obscure fashion publication that somehow managed to feature their idol, Tong Zhao. They felt it was necessary to boost sales to support the magazine. Tong Zhao’s fans didn’t engage in bulk buying or mass purchases, but with so many of them, even fans of her ex-boyfriend Han Zhi would purchase a copy to show their support.
 

 
‘WeatherVane’, a reputable and serious financial magazine, was completely sold out in both physical and online stores within a single day, thanks to the combined efforts of curious passersby, fans, white-collar workers, and stock market enthusiasts.
 

 
After the truth came out, WV's regular readership began complaining about the "fandom frenzy."
 

 
However, the “fandom girls” were innocent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fan club and the official channels didn’t promote bulk buying or collect money for sales. They were used to buying just one copy for personal use, and maybe another as a collectible. They hadn’t even gotten involved in the buying spree! Many of Tong Zhao’s fans couldn’t even get a copy!
 

 
As a result, a debate started under WV’s official Weibo account.
 

 
[Can we be reasonable? It’s clearly because the official side didn’t anticipate the sales, which led to the stock running out. We didn’t buy that many.]
 

 
[Is WV prohibiting new readers from buying? If so, could the official account make a statement, please?]
 

 
After some “friendly” exchanges, the original readers realized it was just a mix-up and started blaming the official account. Fortunately, WV’s official Weibo responded quickly, issuing an apology and announcing that they would immediately print more copies to meet the demand, while also welcoming new readers to learn more about financial knowledge.
 

 
Some bystanders felt sorry for WV, while others in the industry commented:
 

 
[Why feel sorry for WV? With this kind of sales, the editor-in-chief is probably laughing so much their mouth is going to tear.]
 

 
This statement is quite accurate.
 

 
Just bringing in the mysterious backer of ZeShan Investments was already a huge draw, but then it turns out that the person is Tong Zhao? It’s like hitting the jackpot—two yolks in one egg, a pie falling from the sky, and inside the pie is a gold ingot. They've made a huge profit.
 

 
However, the editor-in-chief still underestimated Tong Zhao’s ability to drive sales and her popularity.
 

 
Although the new magazine couldn’t meet everyone’s demand for copies right away, the content was quickly scanned and uploaded, allowing curious readers to get a sneak peek.
# Chapter94
This issue of WV featured a very special profile.
 

 
It started by listing a long string of investment projects in great detail.
 

 
Industry professionals with some research background, or investors with a keen sense of smell, were all surprised to find that these were all high-profit projects from this year, including some that were originally not well-regarded but later made a dramatic rise. Several stocks performed surprisingly well after receiving investment, even managing to overtake competitors after a sudden boost...
 

 
All of these were projects that ZeShan Venture Capital had participated in, ranked by the depth of their involvement.
 

 
Upon closer inspection, not a single one had lost money.
 

 
In less than a year, ZeShan Venture Capital had already accumulated a staggering profit return.
 

 
[For a young investment firm, this is almost an impossible feat. Anyone who works in investment knows that the basic process involves thorough selection, review, and project evaluation. Only after this is a project deemed to have potential for profit is investment made. Even with the most careful evaluations, no matter how reliable a project appears, it still has the possibility of significant losses.]
 

 
[An investment firm's profits typically come from the profitable projects that offset the losses from the unsuccessful ones. As long as the gains exceed the losses, an overall profit is achieved.]
 

 
[Today, we have invited the star investor behind this venture capital firm for an exclusive interview.]
 

 
[However, what the author didn’t expect was that their true identity would be...]
 

 
Behind the four lines of white text, there was an elegant backshot.
 

 
The tailored suit made her shoulders sharp and strong, while her long hair cascaded down her back—during the photo shoot, Tong Zhao had rejected the stylist’s suggestion to tie her hair into a neat bun or adopt a more professional hairstyle. Why should the media erase feminine traits when talking about successful women? Why should she present herself as a gender-neutral elite to be considered professional?
 

 
Tong Zhao never thought this way.
 

 
Of course, when her identity was that of an investor, Tong Zhao didn’t deliberately emphasize her feminine charm.
 

 
What she showed was her most authentic side, yet still keeping a sense of distance.
 

 
The woman in that backshot had an enviable body figure, but complementing that was the shining record described in those lines of text. WV had many middle-aged male readers, whose interests were more about profit than vanity. They completely overlooked her figure, instead being deeply attracted by her achievements in the investment world.
 

 
How did she do it?
 

 
Did Tong Zhao have an investment column in WV?
 

 
Please, master, enlighten us!
 

 
This was the voice of some readers.
 

 
“When I saw Miss Tong for the first time, I knew this interview would cause a huge stir.”
 

 
Upon hearing the journalist’s question, Tong Zhao smiled. “I’ve been thinking about when to reveal this identity,” she paused and then added, “Actually, I didn’t deliberately hide it. It’s just that my main job is too busy, and all the public-facing tasks were handled by Zekai and the others. They also wanted to protect me as much as possible... It’s a lovely misunderstanding. Plus, since it has nothing to do with my acting career, revealing it just hasn’t made it to the agenda.”
 

 
When the topic turned to ZeShan Venture Capital's members, a warm expression appeared on Tong Zhao’s otherwise distant face.
 

 
“Mr. Wei Zekai has said before that founding ZeShan Venture Capital was your idea—was that true?”
 

 
Tong Zhao openly admitted this and briefly described how ZeShan was established. It sounded almost unbelievable that this highly profitable investment firm had been set up in such an informal and almost playful manner. There was even a hint of making it up as they went along: “The high efficiency of ZeShan in generating funds is directly related to the fact that it’s a one-man show. In the beginning, I had absolute decision-making power, but now that Zekai has matured a lot, I’ve entrusted him with many of the detailed decisions.”
 

 
“What made you choose to enter two completely unrelated industries? Was there any particular opportunity? Many people speculate that it’s because you come from a business family.” The last question, which touched on a sensitive topic, had been cleared with Tong Zhao beforehand.
 

 
She indeed needed a chance to clarify.
 

 
Tong Zhao would rather toss money around casually than gild the lily.
 

 
“Both film and investment require a good eye, and fortunately, I have that.”
 

 
“As for the opportunity? It has nothing to do with my family background. My father always believed that his daughter couldn’t take over the family business. My interest in business came partly from passion, and partly because...” At this point, Tong Zhao's lips curved into a joyful smile, and she continued, “Most of my friends have had some experience with business failures, so I thought I’d give it a try myself.”
 

 
The reporter then asked several questions regarding Tong Zhao’s views on investment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not hold back, but instead used her own successful experiences to explain things in a straightforward yet deep way.
 

 
Even readers with no understanding of finance or economics would not see Tong Zhao as just a figurehead in her company after reading her eloquent responses. Although there was a hint of hindsight in her words, she had succeeded many times—surely it couldn’t all be luck! Wouldn’t listening to a successful person be more insightful than reading some theoretical column?
 

 
The journalist quickly recorded what Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Since WV was a finance magazine, there were many questions that new readers might be curious about, but which the journalist couldn’t ask. However, the journalist still hoped to gain a little gossip for the readers...
 

 
When asked about her installment purchase of the Long Xuan property, Tong Zhao smiled lightly:
 

 
“Buying in installments was simply because I didn’t want it to tie up too much of my capital.”
 

 
“And as for the contributions from ZeShan members? They all sent me a lot of furniture to celebrate my housewarming. When I get a chance, I’ll share some pictures of my new home on Weibo.”
 

 
The interview concluded with a brief introduction of the value of the property Tong Zhao had purchased.
 

 
The final photo was taken in Tong Zhao's study.
 

 
Wearing frameless glasses, she hid the sparkle in her almond-shaped eyes, giving off a temperament that was both restrained and intellectual.
 

 
After the public uproar had died down a bit, Xu Zhu had been subtly flaunting her blissful, pre-marriage life on her personal Weibo. She received all of Tong Zhenming’s love and seemed to live like a princess in a fairytale, about to marry into a "rich family." As for the struggles behind closed doors, netizens knew nothing about it. Even if she had to swallow her bitterness in silence, she would never let Tong Zhao know that she wasn’t living well.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who lived alone in a spacious penthouse, had graced the cover of a well-known finance magazine, appearing like an all-powerful queen.
 

 
……
 

 
This scanned version of the interview allowed many netizens to finally read the content they were curious about.
 

 
While most netizens didn’t find anything unusual, Tong Zhao’s fans became anxious and spontaneously organized campaigns to promote subscriptions to WeatherVane's official digital version, which was reasonably priced. Of course, there were still those who had no qualms about reading pirated versions, but many fans, after being reminded, went ahead and purchased the high-definition digital versions, which resulted in a significant increase in the magazine’s online sales.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were very copyright-conscious.
 

 
Unintentionally, this left a good impression on many businesses.
 

 
Although there was this minor pirated content issue, the fact that Tong Zhao appeared on the cover of WeatherVane still successfully shook the entire internet...
 

 
Even those who never cared about the entertainment industry or didn’t watch blockbuster movies were now aware of this big news!
 

 
What?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s side business is investing? She made a lot of money?
 

 
That’s not surprising...
 

 
Don’t celebrities usually make a lot of money?
 

 
Wait, the apps I use daily like Xiao Yang Companion, Huanhui Video, Meitu Master, etc., were all funded by ZeShan Venture Capital? Ordinary people, who thought investment had nothing to do with them, were amazed and fascinated by the fact that “I’m actually using projects that Tong Zhao invested in,” and were eager to learn more.
 

 
They suddenly felt more involved, like they were the seed in this big fruit.
 

 
The more they learned, the more they discovered a new side of Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so impressive…]
 

 
[I always thought ZeShan sounded familiar—didn’t my dad always talk about this genius investment firm?]
 

 
[Wow, many of these projects have the potential to go public. Sister Zhao is amazing!]
 

 
[Before working with Tong Zhao, Young Master Wei seemed to be losing money a lot. Looks like it’s really Sister Zhao who helped him turn things around.]
 

 
[Got it. I used to think she was just marrying into wealth, but now I realize the rich guy is the one holding on to her.]
 

 
[All I want to know is, does the scumbag dad regret it? He let go of the golden leg.]
 

 
Speaking of the scumbag dad, netizens remembered the issue about full payments and loans for buying houses, which was mentioned earlier by Bala Media.
 

 
Intrigued, netizens dug a little deeper and found another juicy tidbit.
 

 
@EntertainmentExposer:
 

 
Netizens discovered that the down payment for the Long Xuan A1 unit was enough to buy two of Xu Zhu’s pre-marriage homes outright. /laughing/ /laughing/
 

 
They even included photos.
 

 
Although the photos were of the same unit type, the differences between the two were immediately apparent. Given the high attention around this tidbit, some interested parties analyzed the scale and estimated profits of Tong Zhenming’s company, concluding that: [Even if the scumbag dad sold his blood, he wouldn’t be able to buy the Long Xuan A1 unit outright. Paying in installments would be just as difficult.]
 

 
Now, no one felt sorry for Tong Zhao anymore.
 

 
Instead, people found her family of clowns laughable.
 

 
Many children who had been mistreated by their birth families could relate to Tong Zhao and felt the same satisfaction as reading a "feel-good" story.
 

 
[Every time Tong Zhao steps out of her circle, she does so in such a unique way…]
 

 
[Shocking the whole company.]
 

 
[Upstairs 1, not gonna lie, my boss, who’s obsessed with stock trading, has already started worshiping her as the Goddess of Wealth.]
 

 
If this wasn’t enough of a reality check, then the WeChat conversation records that Wei Zekai shared further confirmed that Tong Zhao was indeed the true decision-maker behind ZeShan Venture Capital.
 

 
@Wei Zekai v:
 

 
Some content that’s no longer considered commercial secrets.
 

 
Just consider it a fan benefit, hoping more people can get to know her other side.
 

 
The nine-grid chat screenshots were taken from the ZeShan management group, showing Tong Zhao making decisions and giving directions. From the founding of ZeShan to their latest investments, these screenshots proved that each project bore Tong Zhao’s stamp of approval.
 

 
Some comments even teased about their relationship, asking what the connection was between them.
 

 
Wei Zekai personally replied to one such comment: [We're partners and super good friends.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai might not know, but answering like that makes the ship even more shippable.]
 

 
[Don’t ask, just know they’re partners.]
 

 
[Got it, it’s real!]
 

 
……
 

 
With nothing else to do, Wei Zekai had to retreat offline and play dead.
 

 
At this point, the big gossip had reached a resolution.
 

 
Later, ZeShan's second-generation rich members posted on Weibo about the housewarming gifts they gave to Tong Zhao—expensive furniture and useful gadgets. Wei Zekai had given her an Italian Baxter sofa, which cost at least a million yuan if imported, a full set of Gaggenau kitchen appliances, and high-end audio and video equipment... He had put a lot of thought into the gift, since future private meetings would likely be held at her home.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a new movie coming out, and of course, she would need a place to watch it.
 

 
Her home was the perfect gathering spot.
 

 
Moreover, all the second-generation rich had made a lot of money through ZeShan, so they didn’t have to worry about their family’s disapproval. Some even saw their status at home rise because of their connection to ZeShan... Everyone wanted a piece of the pie and asked Tong Zhao what projects she was currently interested in.
 

 
They knew they’d have a chance to enjoy the benefits together, so the gifts were particularly lavish.
 

 
The gossip still had some lingering buzz as netizens discovered...
 

 
If we’re talking about being favored, then Tong Zhao was indeed adored by the rich young heirs!
 

 
However, calling her a little princess seemed a bit beneath her.
 

 
At the very least, she was at the queen level.
 

 
The agent and the company closely monitored the big data and found that Tong Zhao's popularity and public favorability had significantly increased, and her fanbase had seen another breakthrough. However, the number of male fans had slightly declined—some male users seemed unable to accept her strong ability to run a company. This was a strange phenomenon because, in the past, there had been female stars who were famous for their high fees, but this kind of "unfollowing" phenomenon never occurred before...
 

 
The final analysis suggested that when female stars become wealthy because of their beauty, acting skills, and sex appeal, it doesn't trigger the insecurity and resentment of male fans. However, when a female star achieves remarkable success in what they perceive as a male-dominated field, they cannot accept it.
 

 
"It doesn't matter,"
 

 
Sister Chu scoffed, bringing this PR matter to a close. She then turned to ask her assistant, "Would you consider this as ‘purifying’ Tong Zhao's fanbase?"
 

 
"Purifying" a fanbase usually refers to turning group fans (such as those who follow a group or a couple) into solo fans (or "only fans")—often involving marketing strategies and tactics that disappoint group fans, making them feel sympathy for the idol and thereby making the fanbase more loyal to the individual member.
 

 
Tong Zhao's "purification"?
 

 
It was more like driving away the low-minded individuals who couldn't stand seeing a female celebrity succeed in business.
 

 
"I don't think so," the assistant hesitated.
 

 
"Ultimately, it's a good thing—it reduces the harassment from color-based hate messages," Sister Chu concluded.
 

 
With the storm subsiding, Tong Zhao was granted a week off to rest. During this time, she handled some business affairs for ZeShan Venture Capital. The agent believed that Tong Zhao's exposure in the first half of the year was sufficient, and her position in the industry was now almost unshakeable. Her momentum was at its peak. With the highly anticipated film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ waiting to be released, she no longer needed to shoot variety shows and dramas back to back as she had before.
 

 
Her status was solidified, so now it was time to cultivate a higher profile.
 

 
After waiting, the film ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was finally edited and began its promotional phase.
 

 
Tong Zhao had gained experience in promotional events, and there was nothing special about this round of marketing—just the same old routine. The only downside was that her brief but enjoyable holiday was coming to an end, as ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was a big-budget production, meaning the promotional tour would likely require a nationwide run.
 

 
Then came a phone call from Sister Chu, her tone subtle and somewhat complicated, as if something unbelievable had happened:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, did you agree to a ‘friendly sparring’ with Jiang Dang...?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, sitting on the sofa eating watermelon with a friend, had her hand slip and the watermelon fell to the floor.
# Chapter95
After asking more questions, Tong Zhao finally understood the whole situation.
 

 
Let’s rewind the timeline to a day earlier.
 

 
Normally, when it comes to movie promotions, the actor’s agent will coordinate the schedule — deciding what to do and where to go at specific times. A series of arrangements must be made in advance, and some smaller stars might use this massive exposure opportunity to secure some individual bookings.
 

 
Both Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao had long passed this stage.
 

 
After the completion ceremony, when the draft of the promotional announcement was being prepared, the company asked if the artist had any thoughts or suggestions. Tong Zhao was only interested in making the movie. Once the film was completed, it was like an author filling in a plot hole — the project became just another finished task. She had feelings about the project, of course, but anything further was just business. So, she nonchalantly handed everything over to her agent.
 

 
This made Sister Chu both happy and a little regretful.
 

 
She was happy because Tong Zhao trusted her so much, but she was regretful because Tong Zhao didn’t have much interest in the promotion.
 

 
On the other hand, Jiang Dang took the promotional campaign very seriously and made suggestions.
 

 
This caused Jiang Dang’s agent, Aaron, to feel his heart leap to his throat.
 

 
When Jiang Dang proposed a live-streamed free-fight match with Tong Zhao, Aaron’s heart sank even further.
 

 
It felt like it had dropped to the floor.
 

 
“Bro, are you serious?” Aaron’s attitude dramatically shifted. “Have you regained your character’s memory? Didn’t we fight enough in the movie?”
 

 
Of course, as one of the few who had seen the original cut of the movie, Aaron knew the underlying meaning of this question — ‘Didn’t you already get enough of a beating in the film?’ Jiang Dang turned around and gave him a look full of unspoken emotion, his tone soft and lingering, “In the movie, the action designer was in control, so it wasn’t really me fighting; it was a stunt double, no esports spirit there.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Wasn’t that obvious?
 

 
Without the stunt coordinator enhancing your moves, without the action designer manipulating you, you’d have been knocked out by Tong Zhao in an instant — and what would be left to act?
 

 
And what’s with the "esports spirit"?
 

 
Aaron tried his best to hold back, but finally couldn’t take it anymore:
 

 
“Aren’t you just good at playing Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan? What does esports spirit have to do with you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan has professional leagues, you know.”
 

 
His voice was magnetic and alluring, but when he spoke casually, there was often an inexplicable tone, as if he were intentionally acting cute. Aaron, being another man, didn’t get the appeal and found it a bit cringy, but Jiang Dang remained oblivious, still using his beautiful voice, which had conquered the entire new generation of Chinese-language pop music, to act cute: “She agreed to fight me. If you don’t believe me, ask her.”
 

 
His tone was almost one of mock indignation.
 

 
The rejection from the agent spun around in Jiang Dang's vast mind like an endless universe. He didn’t know what kind of scenario he had imagined, but the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. His emotions were written all over his handsome face, the deep, perfect lines of his features tightening slightly. His mischievous and noble aura made him seem like a demon lord from a fantasy film, whose mere glance could cause heads to roll…
 

 
Jiang Dang pulled out his phone, his long, distinct fingers slowly typing out a message…
 

 
“What are you writing?”
 

 
The agent leaned over to take a look. It was the page for posting on his official Weibo account.
 

 
[Want, to, fight, a, woman…]
 

 
The agent quickly snatched the phone away, his temples throbbing. He realized this guy had somehow cracked the password to his official Weibo account… Yes, while others tend to talk too much, Jiang Dang was someone who would mess up after saying just one sentence. So, in order to better manage his public image and avoid being misunderstood because of his unusual way of expressing himself (the phrase “want to fight a woman” actually didn’t imply any hatred towards women, it was just a random emotional outburst he had when thinking about sparring with Tong Zhao), the agent had worked hard to keep Jiang Dang’s Weibo secure.
 

 
But honestly, this guy had such low emotional intelligence, how did he manage to be so skillful in weird areas?
 

 
Not only was he a semi-professional player of Qiu Qiu Da Zuo Zhan (a mobile game), but he had also been a hacker.
 

 
Jiang Dang had once explained it to him with an air of mystery.
 

 
— Because in the world of 0s and 1s, there aren't as many twists and turns. It’s much easier to understand than the world of ordinary people.
 

 
The agent didn’t understand C language.
 

 
All he got from Jiang Dang’s statement was that it sounded like some bizarre philosophical rambling.
 

 
“You post this kind of content, people will think you’re a misogynist,” the agent said, trying to suppress his urge to pinch his ear. “Even if you're talking about something else, this kind of statement should never come from a public figure. It can lead to misunderstandings.”
 

 
After five minutes of lecturing, Jiang Dang finally admitted that he now understood the inappropriateness of what he had written.
 

 
He may have low emotional intelligence, but he didn’t want to encourage others to hurt women, or have his female fans go around hurting men to please him... That thought was horrifying, so he needed to be careful with his words. After getting his phone back, he sincerely apologized, “Thanks for the reminder.”
 

 
The apology was very sincere.
 

 
One could feel that he was genuinely sorry.
 

 
The agent breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
Sigh, Jiang Dang was a little insane, but he wasn’t a bad person.
 

 
Just as the agent was feeling some relief, he saw that Jiang Dang had deleted the original text and replaced it with something new:
 

 
[Want, to, be, hit, by, a, woman…]
 

 
…
 

 
The agent nearly choked on his breath, almost unable to catch it.
 

 
Jiang Dang, with his innocent look on his face, looked so good that it was infuriating.
 

 
After spending so much time with him, the agent had come to understand his thoughts. Saying he wanted to “fight a woman” might encourage fans to do something bad, but saying he wanted to “be hit by a woman” should be fine, right? Little genius! The agent sternly prepared to lecture him, but when Jiang Dang looked at him with those long eyelashes and delicate phoenix eyes, the agent’s heart skipped a beat, and he found himself changing his words, “Fine, Brother Dang, I was wrong. I’ll arrange it for you, just don’t mess with me anymore, my heart can’t handle it.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Yay!”
 

 
…
 

 
Agent: “Yay my ass!”
 

 
…
 

 
After quietly listening to Sister Chu explain the situation to her, Tong Zhao came to a conclusion: “So, the publicity team has decided to have me and Jiang Dang do a live-streamed free-fight match, right?”
 

 
"Yes..."
 

 
Sister Chu’s voice was tinged with helplessness. "Do you want me to reject it for you?"
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly. "No need. I did promise him, so if we’re fighting, then let’s fight."
 

 
After all, she wasn’t going to lose.
 

 
"Actually, it sounds kind of interesting. What do you think Jiang Dang has in his head?"
 

 
Sister Chu was stumped.
 

 
It was probably a question that no one in the entire entertainment industry could answer.
 

 
But because no one knew the real answer, Jiang Dang’s devoted fans were very eager to give him all sorts of strange personas, as if he were an oddly beautiful egg, with poets daydreaming that inside the egg was an entire universe.
 

 
The two shifted the topic and discussed other schedule arrangements.
 

 
"Alright, I understand. No problem."
 

 
After finishing the call, Tong Zhao looked up and met the curious eyes that were trying hard to control their curiosity.
 

 
With money, even ghosts can grind the mill. Tong Zhao’s house was renovated at an unbelievably fast pace, and at the same time, it became the headquarters for ZeShan Venture Capital. Contrary to some malicious speculation about how lonely a single woman must be living in a large apartment, her friends were more than happy to stay at her place and hang out every day—it was luxurious and comfortable. The agent hired cleaning staff and a chef through reliable channels to live with her and take care of her meals and any catering needs for guests.
 

 
For example, when her friends came over, they could have fresh fried chicken, fries, and popcorn made right on the spot.
 

 
Sometimes, when Tong Zhao was on work calls, her fearless friends would quietly wait for her to finish, knowing the drill.
 

 
One of the second-generation rich kids couldn’t hold back any longer. "What do you mean by 'fight'? Is it a game?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
Tong Zhao explained the entire situation from start to finish, then commented, "He’s a strange person, but not unpleasant. He seems to be the type who follows his own temperament… a creative singer, an artistic person with a certain nature. He’s interesting to talk to, always able to surprise people. He’s quite fun."
 

 
When following his nature to the extreme, it could turn into selfishness.
 

 
Building his own satisfaction on the suffering of others.
 

 
Jiang Dang managed to control this balance very well. It seemed that, in addition to having a broad mind, he also had decent upbringing. During their multiple collaborations on ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Tong Zhao’s impressions of him were generally good, and she could feel his intense desire to compete in the film. She figured it was fine to indulge him a little.
 

 
"Besides, this angle creates a lot of buzz and has a positive impact on the movie’s promotion."
 

 
After she finished speaking, she hummed and laughed. "Seems like compared to him, I’m actually quite pragmatic."
 

 
After discussing Jiang Dang for a while, the group shifted their focus and headed to the game room to play multiplayer video games.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned back on the sofa and said she would go over later.
 

 
Wei Zekai stayed behind to keep her company.
 

 
"Come on, speak up."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow. "Speak about what?"
 

 
"You've got a lot on your mind, it’s almost written on your face. And you’re asking me what to say?"
 

 
Tong Zhao reached out and pinched his face.
 

 
It was a shame. When he was younger, his chubby cheeks were fun to pinch, but now his face had slimmed down so much that there wasn’t much flesh to grab. Though his sharp, well-defined features were more pronounced, the fun of pinching his little chubby cheeks was gone. Tong Zhao pinched his face while voicing her thoughts, but Wei Zekai disagreed.
 

 
"I'm not skinny, alright? I’ve got plenty of muscle."
 

 
"Where?"
 

 
Wei Zekai lifted his shirt, revealing a perfectly sculpted set of abs.
 

 
With just a little tension, the tattoo on his side near his obliques became visible as his muscles tightened.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick glance, her voice flat as she deadpanned, "Mmm, so impressive. So sexy."
 

 
Wei Zekai saw right through her indifference. "Can you at least pretend to be surprised?"
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I can’t help it. Lately, I’ve been shooting photos in the studio, and, well... there are male models everywhere, shirtless, and they look good too."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Three giant exclamation marks seemed to practically leap out of Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
He was upset. Very upset.
 

 
"They look better than me?"
 

 
Not really.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s looks could easily get him into the entertainment industry. His features were refined enough to be on a whole different level.
 

 
But they were all good-looking guys, and to get better shooting results, they would all work on their muscles before going on set (muscles look especially good after a workout, so it’s a thing among straight guys who take selfies at the gym), some even applied oil to enhance the visual effect…
 

 
Tong Zhao caught the defeat in her friend’s tone and quickly changed the subject, "Why compare yourself to models? You’re the best-looking."
 

 
Although Wei Zekai was prone to irritation, he was also easy to calm down.
 

 
When Tong Zhao said he was the best-looking, he believed her.
 

 
Within two sentences, he dropped the subject and said, "By the way, Jiang Dang wants to fight you... how come you agreed to it? I haven’t even had a chance to fight you yet."
 

 
Aha, now he was really getting into it.
 

 
Tong Zhao grabbed a handful of milk candies from the coffee table and handed them to him. "Have some candy to keep that mouth of yours shut. Are you asking to get beaten?"
 

 
"I just feel like others have done things with you, but I haven’t, and it’s a bit annoying."
 

 
And if you did...?
 

 
Tong Zhao slowed down her thoughts, which had been racing at seventy miles per hour.
# Chapter96
After all, martial arts values peace and harmony, and one must uphold martial ethics, not engage in internal struggles.
 

 
Although he had bruises in three places, Wei Zekai was still in high spirits and went to play games with the other friends. This left Tong Zhao feeling puzzled. After two lifetimes, she didn’t know that Wei Zekai was actually a bit of a masochist? However, emotionally, it made sense. He probably felt that only close friends could have that kind of playful interaction.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a short nap on the sofa.
 

 
What she didn’t know was that Wei Zekai had gone to boast to the other friends.
 

 
Second-generation C: "Did you fight back?"
 

 
"Of course!"
 

 
Wei Zekai took the game controller: "I wasn’t trying to get beaten up. It was just a friendly spar!"
 

 
"Did you really fight back? Your brain doesn’t work that well, you didn’t hurt our Sister Zhao, right?" Hearing this, second-generation A asked nervously, looking as though he wanted to punch Wei Zekai himself. Some of them had noticed that his relationship with Sister Zhao was different, and they silently thought, is this how you create time for them to be alone? How reassuring...
 

 
"I did fight back, but I didn’t win. She's really good."
 

 
At this point, Wei Zekai's thin lips curled into a slightly smug smile, his face clearly in a good mood.
 

 
No one really understood what he was so proud of, but everyone agreed that Tong Zhao was amazing. This chapter of events was easily closed for everyone.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, she managed to get a good sleep right at the end of the holiday.
 

 
Since becoming famous, she had been under constant scrutiny. For safety and image reasons, she inevitably distanced herself from the crowd. As Kafka said, a person who lives in solitude needs a window facing an alley, so the sounds of her friends joking around in the game room served as the best white noise, lulling her into a deep, safe, and peaceful sleep.
 

 
Aside from that, she asked for nothing more.
 

 
...
 

 
The holiday ended, and after two promotional events, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ began its nationwide tour, which was almost as intense as a nationwide performance tour. The schedule was very packed, testing the physical stamina of all the roadshow staff. The only time they could rest was while traveling by car or airplane, but could they really rest well in such a small space? Clearly, they could not. So, aside from putting on bright smiles when facing the audience, nearly everyone had the same exhausted expression.
 

 
Especially during some pre-screening events.
 

 
Because spoilers couldn’t be given, the topics of conversation with the audience were often irrelevant.
 

 
They could only talk about local food or scenic spots, and then end with a group photo.
 

 
But when it came to food and scenery...
 

 
There was simply no time to eat, drink, or play—there was no time to even sleep!
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao.
 

 
Each time they went on tour, all the roadshow members were shocked by Tong Zhao’s incredible stamina and good appetite. Her food intake wasn't particularly large, but during the last event of the day, when the promotional activities might go on until midnight, by the time everyone returned to their accommodations, they were too tired to have any appetite. The staff would take a few bites of food and call it a meal, and the stars, in order to maintain their figures, ate even less—those few pieces of salad leaves were practically the same as not eating, and anything with too much oil or salt was impossible to stomach. Plus, they had to get up early for the next morning’s event.
 

 
But what was Tong Zhao doing?
 

 
After confirming there wouldn't be any emergencies, she would visit local snack streets and famous restaurants in every city. She would even bring back bags of snacks, many of which would be eaten by the staff during the ride.
 

 
So, since they couldn’t talk about the movie content or give spoilers during the pre-screening events, the conversation would often turn to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Where’s a good place nearby to visit?
 

 
What’s delicious to eat?
 

 
She was the only one who could keep the conversation going.
 

 
“There’s a really good pig’s stomach chicken restaurant nearby? Hmm, I’ve been there. What stood out to me the most was the bamboo fungus inside, it’s much longer than regular bamboo fungus. I personally recommend the Shunde fish skin dumplings.”
 

 
“I went there at midnight. We spent all day doing the roadshow, so some of the places were closed, but the snack street stays open really late.”
 

 
“I’ve been to the beach at dawn. The water quality is really good.”
 

 
Tong Zhao kept in mind that during the promotional period, she needed to increase her exposure and couldn’t stay too low-key. So, she happily took selfies whenever she went out and posted them on her Weibo in the same grid-style format. However, she only posted pictures from a city after leaving for the next one, which made it impossible for her enthusiastic fans to track her down. They had no choice but to obediently follow the roadshow.
 

 
Once the movie promotion period began, it was the happiest time for her fans.
 

 
[Today, I found another high-intensity 9-grid post!]
 

 
[More swimsuit pics! I don’t need this bit of traffic qwq]
 

 
[I saw something! It’s the hot pot grid from her 9-grid Weibo, I’m starving! Sister Zhao, where are you going next? Will you come to my hometown?]
 

 
The person saying this was a soft girl, and Tong Zhao happened to be scrolling through Weibo when she replied: [You didn’t even say where your hometown is, sis.]
 

 
Not only did she reply, but she also called her "sis," which made the female fan so excited she nearly fainted.
 

 
Tong Zhao's bold presence naturally triggered some criticism.
 

 
Like many celebrities with high traffic and hot topics, it’s impossible to be loved by everyone online; instead, there will always be discussions—along with true fans, there will be genuine haters. Love can come unexpectedly, and hate can be just as passionate.
 

 
So, what’s the angle this time?
 

 
It’s that Tong Zhao isn’t taking her work seriously, neglecting the roadshow to go off and have fun.
 

 
This criticism isn’t entirely baseless.
 

 
Netizens who don’t understand the roadshow process might think that it’s normal to eat and play a bit while traveling between cities. But anyone who understands the promotional tour for a movie would know that this is nearly impossible. There was an instance where more than 20 main creators were divided into three groups, traveling to nearly 100 cities across the country in 35 days, completing 500 promotional events. Just hearing the scale of that workload shows how tight the schedule is.
 

 
Of course, ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wasn’t quite that extreme, but it wasn’t far off.
 

 
If the roadshow has strong feedback, the investors will increase funding.
 

 
So, there are movies where the main creative team’s effort in running roadshows leads to a successful turnaround.
 

 
If one or two photos are showing that they squeezed in a bit of time for leisure, it might be excusable. But to visit every city? It couldn’t be that the whole crew is waiting for her to have fun, could it?
 

 
Some netizens compiled Tong Zhao’s recent Weibo posts.
 

 
Sure enough, she posted photos of her enjoying herself in each city. During the roadshow, she still found time to visit shops. It seemed almost like a spiritual mystery.
 

 
Some haters seized on this point, criticizing her for being unprofessional.
 

 
After all, wasn’t it just recently that she used a month of seclusion to build her "dedicated" persona?
 

 
Fans who understood the process didn’t know how to defend her. They could only weakly reply: "The core duty of an actor is to deliver a good performance, and post-production promotion and pre-filming work shouldn’t be considered the same thing to criticize."
 

 
The haters triumphantly retorted: "Why isn’t it the same? Stars with more clout than her are still doing the roadshows properly. Why is it that when it comes to her, it’s a nationwide tour?"
 

 
Fans were infuriated!
 

 
But they couldn’t bear to tell Tong Zhao to stop playing and focus on the roadshow.
 

 
They could only mute the microphone and quietly repeat their anticipation for her new film to release.
 

 
This small public opinion storm did attract some attention from the industry. Since it was during the movie’s promotional period, the creative team naturally wouldn’t let any dirt be thrown on them without responding. Tong Zhao, who brought in attention with her presence, posted roadshow photos that garnered more attention, which benefited the movie. This minor controversy, if handled well, could serve as free promotion.
 

 
First, the official Weibo account of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ listed the roadshow schedule and stated that Tong Zhao had never been late or left early.
 

 
Then, they bought a marketing account to clarify from a third-party perspective.
 

 
@EntertainmentFrontline:
 

 
A netizen pointed out that in Tong Zhao’s “roadshow travel diary,” the photos were all taken late at night or in the early morning hours, without taking up work time. It seems that for the sake of fun, Sister Zhao really worked hard!
 

 
[Screenshot]
 

 
At first glance, the photos are indeed from unusual hours.
 

 
The popular shops Tong Zhao visited were mostly open until late at night.
 

 
There were also fan reports from roadshow attendees who mentioned that when Tong Zhao met with fans, she didn’t look tired or sleep-deprived at all. In fact, she appeared to be in great spirits, indicating that her balance of work and leisure was effective!
 

 
There were also on-site photos to support this.
 

 
When netizens saw them, they seemed to believe it was true.
 

 
Since it didn’t affect her work, aside from the extreme haters who needed to fabricate stories to criticize her, no one else was fixated on the issue anymore.
 

 
The main creators and Sister Chu worked together to clarify the situation, which led to a round of positive publicity.
 

 
Originally, the matter would have been forgotten.
 

 
But then Jiang Dang posted on Weibo.
 

 
@JiangDangv:
 

 
"I want Tong Zhao to take me for hotpot... She made me get up at 3 a.m..."
 

 
His agent changed his Weibo password, but he cracked it and regained control of his account once again.
 

 
It’s rare for him to use his main account, and Jiang Dang also enjoys internet fame.
 

 
[So, did you go?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: No, I couldn’t get up.
 

 
[Couldn’t you go by yourself?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: If I went by myself, my agent would tell me to bring a bodyguard. I didn’t want to trouble anyone to work overtime.
 

 
Why doesn’t he need a bodyguard if Tong Zhao goes with him???
 

 
Many netizens flooded the comment section with their doubts.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Go watch my new movie, and you’ll understand."
 

 
Wow, now he’s promoting his own movie—fans were so moved they nearly cried.
 

 
Of course, "actively responding" Jiang Dang lasted only one afternoon before his agent changed his password to something even more complicated, turning it into a battle of wits and making it all the more fun.
 

 
With this side explanation, netizens became more convinced that Tong Zhao wasn’t unprofessional; she just really can do it all.
 

 
The topic then shifted to how much sleep Tong Zhao actually gets in a day.
 

 
…
 

 
The photographer, following the roadshow, was exhausted and almost collapsed. When she saw Tong Zhao heading out, she originally planned to force herself to stay alert to take pictures, but Tong Zhao said it wasn’t necessary—she’d handle it herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao would place her camera, which had a timer function, casually on tree trunks or railings, acting as her own photographer. The photos she took turned out well enough, mainly because of the great material; no matter what angle she shot from, it looked good.
 

 
Her fans were calling for more swimsuit photos, which were actually quite casual.
 

 
In the photos, Tong Zhao wore loose beige pants and a black bikini top, her waist gracefully blending into the pants. In the distance, the dark blue waves, separated by rocky cliffs, met the brightly lit food street. Tong Zhao’s long hair flowed in the wind, the moonlight and stars reflected in her eyes, almost as if it were a beam of frozen light. It was so stunning, it could captivate anyone.
 

 
It was so beautiful.
 

 
The key wasn’t her slender figure, which looked like it had been shaped by hunger. Wearing the bikini, she confidently showed off her abdominal muscles, clearly a sign of well-developed core strength, but it didn’t detract from the overall beauty.
 

 
When talking about Tong Zhao and mentioning this star, it’s inevitable to think about her latest work.
 

 
Isn't it an action film?
 

 
Combining that with the movie she’s currently promoting...
 

 
If female stars work so hard on their physiques, how could the action scenes not be exciting?
 

 
Fans have already started asking those who attended the pre-screening roadshows, "Did Tong Zhao wear anything more revealing during her fight scenes in the movie?"
 

 
"Anyone seen the pre-screening of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’? How’s Tong Zhao’s fight scenes? Does she have chemistry with the male lead? Any predictions for the box office?"
 

 
[Male lead? No need for one, with Tong Zhao in the movie. She’s the only lead; the other guy is just the 'lead's boyfriend.']
 

 
[I feel like the chemistry with her boyfriend isn’t as strong as the one with Fu Xuancheng.]
 

 
[Fu Xuancheng played by Jiang Dang? Honestly, it’s pretty surprising that they invited him to play this role. I think his subconscious might be even more unstable than Tong Zhao's.]
 

 
The discussion got so heated that by the time they reached the 100th comment, the audience who had actually seen the film finally showed up with their reviews.
 

 
"Thanks for the invite, just got out of the screening. Director Shi really picked the right person for this challenge. For a modern martial arts film, it exceeded expectations. The pleasant surprise was that Tong Zhao actually suited this kind of comedy with a bit of a funny element? I originally thought her face would be too serious and not funny at all, but she was pretty interesting. The costumes, makeup, and set design were all top-notch. After the screening, the creators said that many of the weapons used were original designs and that they were considering renting them out to other productions after the film finishes. They really put a lot of effort into it."
 

 
"I'm just a casual fan of Jiang Dang, but he's so funny! I feel like only his subconscious could pull off that quirky, stubborn character. And the way he interacts with Tong Zhao... Ah, I can’t spoil it! Just go see it, one movie is all it takes to turn into a fan!"
 

 
"What’s going on with Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao? Don’t just leave it halfway like that."
 

 
"Basically, I’m shipping them now."
 

 
Spoilers couldn’t be stopped. Curious fans scrolled through to the highlighted spoilers and related Weibo posts, piecing together one thing:
 

 
Jiang Dang got beaten up.
 

 
So, what’s the deal with this beating?
 

 
Confusing, I don’t get it.
 

 
It wasn’t until the roadshow ended that a new promotional activity was launched:
 

 
"Tong Zhao accepts Jiang Dang’s challenge and will have an exclusive 1v1 live broadcast of free fighting on Eagle Vision Platform on [Month] [Day]!”
# Chapter97
1v1 Free Fighting?
 

 
Immediately, a ring appeared in the minds of the netizens.
 

 
On opposite sides of the ring stood Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, both striking ready boxing poses.
 

 
...
 

 
The scene was so vivid that the netizens felt a little dizzy.
 

 
Soon after, the official Weibo account released "promotional photos" of the two of them preparing for the fight. Tong Zhao, dressed in a sports vest, showed off her great figure, which netizens dubbed the "most natural" among female stars. Some curious users even compared her body to that of other female celebrities who debuted around the same time. While she might not be the thinnest, she was undoubtedly the most toned and fit.
 

 
[Forget female celebrities, even some young idols don't manage their bodies as well as she does.]
 

 
Some netizens shared screenshots from a swimming variety show, where several handsome young male celebrities had soft and untoned bodies. They weren’t fat, but the metabolism of young men was high, and even without much exercise, their legs were still notably slim.
 

 
It was clear they lacked exercise, which made them less appetizing to look at.
 

 
Even a little muscle tone could set one apart from their peers by a mile.
 

 
Fans, by contrast, often indulged and were too lazy to work out.
 

 
After all, as long as they wore clothes, looking good in the face was enough. If not, post-production could always help fix things.
 

 
[This girl who went out at 3 AM to eat hotpot could have that kind of body?]
 

 
[Got it, spicy food speeds up metabolism, so hotpot is a weight-loss food /dog head.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is truly a time management master!]
 

 
But what about the other photo?
 

 
What surprised netizens was that Jiang Dang's physique was actually quite good.
 

 
In the poster, he had a side profile, and the lighting accentuated his sharp and cold handsome features.
 

 
Jiang Dang's skin tone was pale, seemingly rarely exposed to sunlight.
 

 
After all, the filming for "Instinct" wouldn’t affect his real-life complexion. His hobby was staying home to play video games. Unexpectedly, he had many quiet and refined hobbies. His muscles were the result of his manager telling him to train... He was highly cooperative at work, but sometimes his thinking was a little different from the average person, leading to some hilarious outcomes.
 

 
His body management wasn’t wasted, and it caught the eyes of female fans, who were drooling over him.
 

 
A whole bunch of fangirls below were praising him like he was a "vampire young master" and showering him with compliments, excited about the upcoming performance of both Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang. Some even jokingly wondered if they would release a duet soon.
 

 
Regardless, the hype was definitely there, and it served its purpose in promoting the movie.
 

 
Who has ever seen a movie promotion where the female lead and the antagonist's actor have a real-life offline PK (battle)?
 

 
This is too daring!
 

 
Other movies with concurrent promotions were dumbfounded.
 

 
Some movies had originally thought that having the main cast change into Qing Dynasty costumes during pre-screening warm-up activities would be innovative and creative enough for their promotions. But they didn’t expect that others would take a sharp turn and overtake them... Some promotional teams, not minding being accused of copying others, turned their focus to their own leads.
 

 
But upon reflection, they realized it wouldn't work.
 

 
In a romance movie, having the male and female leads fight each other? Is that even appropriate?
 

 
As for female celebrities in the entertainment industry who could rival Tong Zhao in fighting ability...
 

 
It's hard to think of many.
 

 
With their delicate arms and legs, how could they possibly fight? Wouldn’t their fans tear them apart?
 

 
Instead, now, Jiang Dang’s fans, after learning about Tong Zhao’s fighting skills, were cautiously pleading with her fans on her Weibo, asking her to go easy on him—no punches to the face, no hits to the head, considering he already had some issues to begin with.
 

 
This was a stunt only Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
The industry was in awe.
 

 
Although no one explicitly said it, everyone secretly thought that Tong Zhao was very clever—not only was she pulling stunts on variety shows, but she also dared to engage in such bold operations in real life! No one expected this to have nothing to do with Tong Zhao at all—it was actually Jiang Dang's sudden whim that made the movie's promotion work.
 

 
The promotional effect was so good, and discussions were happening everywhere.
 

 
Wei Zekai, slyly, posted a Weibo saying, "What's the big deal, I’ve already fought with Tong Zhao before."
 

 
Gossip-loving netizens were curious about the outcome.
 

 
@WeiZekaiV: "No comment."
 

 
This mysterious expression was something everyone who knew him could understand—it was obvious he lost the fight, and not only did he fail to fight back, even if he did, it wouldn’t have mattered. Some netizens, taking it seriously, even drew a relationship chart, making it look like a stock market analysis, where Wei Keke was holding steady with his childhood sweetheart, while Jiang Dang was the unexpected, rising star... Some even said...
 

 
[If you like the crazy type, why not consider Shi Qianqiu?]
 

 
[Among these jokers, how normal is Wan Zhi-ge!]
 

 
While waiting for a movie, Song Wanzhuo, surfing the internet, really wanted to say, "Please don’t mention me."
 

 
Recently, he had been seeing Tong Zhao’s action star outfits everywhere, and he was about to unfollow her.
 

 
He wanted his delicate, soft, loving favorite back!
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
Someone asked him what he thought about his beloved Tong Zhao’s new movie, and he casually flipped through his Weibo, showing his support for her: [Watching it in my private holographic theater /smiling face]
 

 
Though he was telling the truth, there was an inexplicable sense of smugness emanating from his words.
 

 
So, the netizens who were following the gossip quickly had their attention diverted by his shameful display of wealth.
 

 
Finally, the day of the live broadcast arrived amid great anticipation.
 

 
The official team had rented a legitimate, large-scale boxing arena. The protective gear, equipment, and the venue were all legal and in compliance with regulations. The promotional photos posted on Weibo beforehand also looked very formal, highlighting the official's serious attitude and piquing the interest of some netizens. While romantic relationships between handsome men and beautiful women are common, it’s rare to see such a scenario where the handsome guy and beautiful girl are fighting each other.
 

 
Though they were called to "fight," it wasn’t entirely accurate.
 

 
When Tong Zhao arrived at the boxing gym, she found that Jiang Dang had already changed into his gear and was warming up. Although he moved slowly, his movements were quite precise. Tong Zhao was a little surprised: "Have you trained before?"
 

 
Muay Thai, karate, and taekwondo are all popular options.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang had challenged her, he must be a martial arts enthusiast with some skills, right?
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Jiang Dang looked up at her with a confused expression, his handsome face showing a hint of, "I have no idea what you're talking about," and replied, "Trained in what? Martial arts? No, just regular fitness stuff."
 

 
"......"
 

 
Wait, what’s with that confusion?
 

 
"Then why did you challenge me to a match?"
 

 
Sitting down, Jiang Dang turned his head back, his thick eyelashes casting shadows over his eyes, and the deep contours of his face disappeared into the darkness as though he was plotting a world-altering conspiracy: "My subconscious is easily influenced by roles. Since I didn’t get enough fighting in the movie, I thought I’d try it in real life."
 

 
Moreover, in the movie, there was a fight choreographer to handle the action scenes, and Jiang Dang felt quite dissatisfied.
 

 
The second half of his sentence, the dissatisfaction, was kept to himself. He didn’t say it out loud, and it made him look a little pitiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she hadn’t asked him this question, she probably would’ve taken him down instantly.
 

 
She was professionally training in martial arts, and her strength was on par with that of heavier men. If she had been serious and ready to fight, it would have taken her only two or three seconds to subdue Jiang Dang. With Duan Ge’s personality, she could have easily taken out an opponent in three seconds. If she had any useful information to extract, she could break his legs or tie him up and ask.
 

 
Duan Ge, with righteous confidence: [The villain dies from talking too much.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [So, you’re putting yourself in the villain’s role now?]
 

 
[Being a villain doesn’t come with many moral burdens,] Duan Ge asked: [So, what do you think? Should I go in for the fight later?]
 

 
Tong Zhao hesitated.
 

 
She felt that sparring with Jiang Dang would be a tough task.
 

 
Since it was a movie promotion, she couldn’t just go up and take him down instantly; the fight needed to look good, with some back-and-forth. Letting him hit her was also an art form in itself, even more complicated than going all out. She wasn’t sure if Duan Ge could handle it, as she only let her female friends win…
 

 
What they were thinking was obvious to each other, and Duan Ge immediately said she could go ahead, letting her take the lead.
 

 
[Alright then…]
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended to reluctantly step aside, letting the main personality take over.
 

 
But she was actually quite willing.
 

 
No one told them that the live broadcast had already begun.
 

 
The official staff had only subtly reminded them that anything that shouldn’t be heard by the public should be kept to themselves once they entered the venue, because the staff at the boxing gym were not under their control and could easily post anything they overheard on Weibo.
 

 
This cute conversation was overheard by the audience who had entered the live stream.
 

 
[Wait, so Jiang Dang was the one who suggested this sparring challenge???]
 

 
[He really showed what it means to have a death wish. Isn't it good enough to be alive?]
 

 
[Hahaha, Tong Zhao's confused expression is too funny! GKDGKD!]
 

 
There were also fans of Jiang Dang praising his physique, saying it wasn’t photoshopped.
 

 
Jiang Dang was the type who looked slimmer when dressed. Usually, he didn’t show off much, but now with his shirt off, his biceps and triceps were well-developed, and his lines were clearly defined. From an appearance standpoint, he seemed to have the upper hand: [Jiang Dang’s body management is on point, the muscle mass is right there. A woman’s punch probably wouldn’t stand a chance.]
 

 
[True, even a guy would struggle with taking that punch.]
 

 
[The two of them aren't even in the same weight class.]
 

 
Aside from the obvious gender difference, boxing matches are also divided into different weight classes, because even if a punch lands in the same spot, the damage and impact are different when thrown by a 200-pound fighter versus a 140-pound fighter.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, it seemed like an unfair match.
 

 
Duan Ge, completely unaware of the ongoing online discussions about her, changed backstage and fully equipped herself, warming up for a bit. Meanwhile, she began to play around with the gym's punching bag equipment.
 

 
The punching bags were solid, and after testing her strength with a few punches, Duan Ge found they could easily withstand her force, so she started putting in more effort.
 

 
A left jab, a right roundhouse kick, and a left cross punch.
 

 
The sound of her strikes was so intense that the staff at the gym turned to look. The live stream’s comments were filled with 666666.
 

 
[Sister Zhao is so A, I’d love to be hit by her 555555.]
 

 
[I suspect she’s the most attractive M-type female celebrity.]
 

 
[I feel like one of her kicks could knock my head off...]
 

 
Admiration for strength is a human instinct.
 

 
Watching Tong Zhao’s pre-match performance, it seemed to hint that an exciting match was about to unfold. The audience in the live stream was getting excited, their anticipation growing. Some couldn’t hold back and started recommending it in their social media posts, calling their friends to come watch.
 

 
There were even betting odds posted on gambling sites about who would win.
 

 
The joys and sorrows of people don’t always align.
 

 
The netizens were celebrating, while Jiang Dang's fans were nervously sweating.
 

 
[Maybe we should just not have the match, I’m so scared qwq]
 

 
[Don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head, don’t hit the head.]
 

 
[Will my brother die from one punch?]
 

 
When the two walked onto the stage, the popularity in the live stream soared like crazy. The backstage staff were puzzled and asked each other, “I haven’t started adjusting the backend data yet, have you?”
 

 
It’s an industry unspoken rule that the viewer and audience numbers for live streams can be inflated to make the numbers look good.
 

 
For paid content like variety shows and movies, inflating the numbers is strictly forbidden, so the data is trustworthy. However, since this was a promotional pre-event, slight adjustments to the data wouldn’t be considered illegal. The staff hadn’t even adjusted the numbers yet, but they watched as the figures shot up as if someone had activated a cheat code.
 

 
“No, I haven’t!”
 

 
“I haven’t either.”
 

 
“You’re the only one with access. Did you burn out from overtime or something?”
 

 
The staff member who had asked was met with a barrage of complaints, but his face was full of smiles. “Guess that means this is real data then... feels like a dream. Let’s tweak the keyword data for the comments.”
 

 
This was the best way to see who was pulling in the crowd.
 

 
On the monitoring screen, it was clear who was the King of audience attraction.
 

 
“75% of the comments are related to Tong Zhao…”
 

 
At this point, the staff sighed, “Whoever gets the traffic gets the world. There were people before who complained about Tong Zhao's subconscious instability, but just look at her ability to create buzz—who wouldn’t want her for promotions? She’s so useful. It feels like she can meet any crazy idea. She's so dedicated.”
 

 
“The audience’s interest is what matters.”
 

 
No matter how boring a variety show is, as long as Sister Zhao is there, she can always make something fresh happen.
 

 
“Jiang Dang is more suited for talk shows,” someone commented.
 

 
While the staff discussed her, the timer for the boxing match was struck by the referee.
 

 
Though the official announcement said it would be free fighting, they ultimately chose the more traditional rules of boxing: three-minute rounds, one-minute rest between rounds, ten rounds in total. After being knocked down, the referee would count to ten, and if the knocked-down fighter couldn’t get up within ten seconds, the other would be declared the winner.
 

 
On the live stream, Tong Zhao, with bandages wrapped around her hands, was looking into the camera.
 

 
She jumped twice in place to loosen up.
 

 
Her black hair fell over her face, brushing past her cold, sharp eyes, piercing directly into the hearts of the female audience.
 

 
Even the girlfriend fans who came for Jiang Dang couldn’t help but admit that this sister’s A-game made it hard for them to feel any jealousy or competition. They just wanted to admire her beauty…
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t care.
 

 
She was talking to other personalities.
 

 
Han Zhi reminded her: 【Remember to go easy. It wouldn’t make sense to knock him down in the first round.】
 

 
Tong Zhao also thought she should give Jiang Dang some face.
 

 
If Jiang Dang were the type of man who looked down on women and provocatively challenged them... considering the rest time between rounds, she could have easily taken him down in eleven minutes. But Jiang Dang was more of a spontaneous type. During their roadshows, he had been polite and well-behaved, so she naturally took him into consideration.
 

 
This solo fight wasn’t to determine the winner between the two.
 

 
It was to promote the movie, so it had to look good.
 

 
Duan Ge: [...So what should I do?]
 

 
According to the rules of Japanese anime, a perfect fight should have the structure of a satisfying story—
 

 
The tension of seemingly mismatched opponents, the nervousness of occasional knockdowns, back-and-forth exchanges leading to the crucial moment, the villain boasting of their plans as they unleash their final move, while the protagonist, about to be defeated, explodes with inner power and turns the tables.
 

 
After Tong Zhao explained, Duan Ge: [Oh, so the challenge in this match lies here.]
 

 
With the unreasonable demands from the client, the fight went from being dull and tedious to something much more challenging.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao was called over by Xiao Zhao to play with his hands.
 

 
...
 

 
The official live stream played the battle anthem.
 

 
The staff, both onstage and backstage, including Jiang Dang and the audience, were all watching intently.
 

 
In the first three rounds, Duan Ge worked hard to let Jiang Dang have the upper hand.
 

 
The staff at the boxing venue were quietly discussing, but Duan Ge didn’t hear them, since she was too busy handling her own situation—
 

 
Xuyi: [You’re hitting too hard, ease up a bit!]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Hey, stop dodging. It’s not like you’ll be hurt by that little bit of strength.]
 

 
Han Zhi reminded: [Remember to act like it hurts when you’re hit.]
 

 
Unexpectedly, after debuting in action films where she relied on her subconscious for her performance, Tong Zhao was now facing a challenge in acting during a promotional event. Duan Ge had to exert tremendous effort to keep her performance on par with Jiang Dang’s, occasionally showing signs of pain.
 

 
[I thought it would be a one-sided fight, but it’s actually pretty exciting?]
 

 
[It’s a bit entertaining! Tong Zhao’s movements are so agile!]
 

 
[In real life, fighting someone heavier means you have to rely on agility to win. It’s like that.]
 

 
In the back-and-forth tug-of-war, the score was tied.
 

 
By the fifth round, Duan Ge estimated it was time for the "villain laughs maniacally and humiliates the protagonist" scene.
 

 
But she missed one detail.
 

 
After gaining a slight advantage from the leniency, Jiang Dang didn’t boast or flaunt his strength. Instead, his gaze toward her became shy and almost infatuated.
 

 
...
 

 
This is crazy!
 

 
Xuyi: [The opponent isn’t cooperating…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [Then let’s move into the counterattack?]
 

 
Han Zhi felt that something was off.
 

 
But Consort Chen, enjoying the chaos, urged Duan Ge to go ahead and hit harder, since she had already been letting him win in the previous rounds.
 

 
The counterattack, Duan Ge was familiar with, and there was no difficulty.
 

 
No more holding back and pretending to be weak, Duan Ge immediately relaxed. As soon as the boxing bell rang, she happily knocked him down in the next five rounds. From the bell ringing to Jiang Dang hitting the ground and the referee counting down the ten seconds...
 

 
It never took more than twenty seconds—it all happened so quickly.
 

 
[?????]
 

 
[What happened to the evenly matched battle??]
 

 
[Ah, so Tong Zhao was holding back earlier?]
 

 
Someone who seemed to have figured out what was going on jumped in to explain: [This is how it is, if they kept the pace of the last five rounds, wouldn’t the whole promotional event be ruined? So it must have been the director's request to let him win earlier.]
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had just finished playing with Xiao Zhao’s hands, ruffled her memory: [Didn't I tell you not to hit him too hard?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [Don’t worry, he’s not hurt!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Then what about holding back?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I held back! I let him win several rounds earlier!]
 

 
...Well, it didn’t seem like there was a problem, except she forgot to continue the act in the later rounds.
 

 
The promotional team, unfairly blamed by the audience as the hidden force behind it all, felt wronged.
 

 
Jiang Dang didn’t last more than twenty seconds in the last five rounds, his body wasn’t badly injured, but he was dazed and looked a little downcast. His fans were worried and kept asking in the comments if he had been knocked silly.
 

 
The host also asked with concern: "Jiang Dang looks unhappy. Is it because he lost?"
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head and, with a hurt expression, looked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
“She let me win… I wanted her to really fight me…”
 

 
He sounded particularly wronged.
 

 
The fans, who had been worried just moments ago, paused for a second.
 

 
[Does he want to be knocked out?]
 

 
[So, am I following a star just to watch my house get flattened by Sister Zhao?]
 

 
[I think he’s really been knocked silly…]
# Chapter98
Due to the dramatic comeback by Duan Ge in the last five rounds...
 

 
The original livestream duration was no longer enough!
 

 
Everything happened so quickly.
 

 
The host, following the original plan, began asking both sides for their post-match thoughts.
 

 
Host: "Brother Dang, how do you feel right now?"
 

 
"Not enough."
 

 
Jiang Dang's physical stamina was good. It was said that he usually trains his lung capacity through swimming and running—though this was more of an urban legend, as lung capacity has no direct connection to singing ability. What mattered more was vocal technique. However, his ability to sing for five to six hours straight with a steady voice, and the fact that his voice had thickness and layers, was often praised by his fans.
 

 
After going through such high-intensity physical activity, Jiang Dang was still sitting on the bench with only a thin layer of sweat on his forehead and neck. The lights of the boxing gym reflected off him, his delicate and slightly devilish features carrying an unspoken vulnerability, which only solidified his title as the "top beauty" of the music world.
 

 
The host's lips subtly twitched, unable to hold back the truth:
 

 
"Wouldn't it have been better if you had lasted a little longer?"
 

 
"Yeah," Jiang Dang said without feeling offended, answering gently, "She's too amazing. When she got serious, I had no way to fight back."
 

 
Host: "Is it the same feeling you had when filming ‘The Knives of the Maiden’?"
 

 
"When we were filming, the action designer helped me a lot, and it wasn't about my own abilities," Jiang Dang answered, remembering his manager’s reminder to always promote the movie, and added, "So, the audience can rest assured, the character Fu Xuancheng in the movie is not as weak as I am."
 

 
...You know you're weak!
 

 
The host almost couldn’t suppress his urge to make a sarcastic comment.
 

 
However, many entertainers, in an effort to take all the credit and glory for themselves, often deliberately avoid talking about action designers or voice actors during interviews—while not explicitly stating that those cool moves were not entirely their own subconscious abilities, the hard work of these behind-the-scenes professionals is often overlooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s active mention of this, however, made the host and some colleagues appreciate him a bit more.
 

 
Since Jiang Dang was so cooperative, the host steered the conversation back to the movie, cleverly plugging it. The viewers watching this were curious too, and began discussing the gap in combat skills between the two:
 

 
[The action designer worked hard. It must have taken a lot of effort to close that gap.]
 

 
[They probably set some limitations for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is the real-life heroine!]
 

 
Isn’t that right? Beautiful and tough, she fulfills many people's fantasy of a female hero.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a quick battle shower in the changing room, dried her hair, applied makeup, and changed into casual clothes before stepping out, where she was immediately greeted by the host's bright smile.
 

 
"Finished interviewing Jiang Dang?" she asked.
 

 
The host nodded and said it was her turn now.
 

 
She greeted the audience in the livestream.
 

 
Tong Zhao appeared in a white T-shirt and hot pants, smiling brightly at the camera. Fans on the bullet screen immediately flooded the chat with passionate declarations of love.
 

 
Host: "I heard this PK was proposed by Brother Dong. What did you think at the time, Sister Xiao?"
 

 
"I was quite surprised because I wasn’t very familiar with him at that time; we’d only exchanged greetings once or twice. But later, during the roadshow, we got to know each other better, and looking back now, it wasn’t surprising that he wanted to challenge me."
 

 
"Haha, speaking of the roadshow, you still didn’t get to have hotpot."
 

 
"Yeah, but when we went to Guangzhou, I brought him back some dim sum."
 

 
"As for how I felt about the challenge..."
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment.
 

 
The camera zoomed in on her face, capturing a close-up of the mischievous smile in her slightly narrowed eyes: "In the first half, I was testing him. In the second half, it seemed like I hadn’t even started trying before he went down. Nothing special! It was pretty much the same as what we do in the movies."
 

 
[“I hadn’t even tried yet, how did you fall down?”]
 

 
[Who’s pretending? Oh, it’s Tong Zhao. Never mind then.]
 

 
[Sister Zhao is amazing 66666.]
 

 
[What does ‘pretty much the same as the movie’ mean? I really want to see the new drama now!]
 

 
Considering the limited conditions in real life, the match was already this exciting—how fierce would she be in the ‘Instinct’ movie?
 

 
This was the thought of most of the audience at that moment.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff worked efficiently, editing the ten-round showdown into a short video, which was promptly posted on Weibo. Related marketing accounts were also quickly set up to help with promotions, creating a wave of strategic marketing…
 

 
Seeing Brother Dong get beaten up, the onlookers couldn’t stop laughing.
 

 
Brother Dong was quite well-liked by the public, though he often came up with weird, out-of-the-box ideas.
 

 
If it had been a regular, normal male celebrity, netizens would have probably imagined that he was under some unspoken pressure, forced to perform this scene where he gets beaten by Tong Zhao, and some fans would inevitably feel sorry for him and complain…
 

 
But this was Brother Dong!
 

 
He himself said he was super happy to get beaten.
 

 
Not only that, he didn’t just want one round of getting hit; he wanted an unlimited refill…
 

 
So the public, with no psychological burden, happily shared and joked about it without any guilt.
 

 
The creativity of netizens is boundless, and one of the posts that garnered over six thousand shares was a meme.
 

 
The first one showed Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in the ring, with no expression.
 

 
The caption: "I can’t win."
 

 
The second one was even better—Tong Zhao pinning Brother Dong to the ground in a six-panel grid.
 

 
The caption: "I’m pretending."
 

 
The contrast was too funny, and it was clear that Tong Zhao was bringing something new to the table.
 

 
Due to the pre-and post-match promotional clips where Brother Dong repeatedly mentioned wanting to keep fighting, those who didn’t know the full story might have thought he had heroically beaten his opponent and was eager to continue torturing her. But it turns out he was the one who got beaten up? How surreal! Fans covered their faces, unable to watch any longer, and onlookers wondered if the livestream was still going. Was there more to see?
 

 
While watching the livestream and scrolling through Weibo, the audience's spirits lifted. They quickly shared the link.
 

 
The number of viewers in the livestream surged.
 

 
New viewers saw that the match had ended, but the original viewers weren’t satisfied yet. They shouted in the bullet screen, wanting more. After some quick calculations, the marketing team remembered Brother Dong’s traditional skill—singing. Brother Dong, wiping sweat with a wet towel, turned to the staff and asked, "If the time is running short, I can keep fighting with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Staff: "…"
 

 
The reactions from both the bullet screen and the staff were exactly the same.
 

 
Staff: "The fans want to hear you sing. Besides, Tong Zhao just fought with you and is exhausted."
 

 
In the boxing gym, there were some simple fitness equipment.
 

 
After hearing the staff, Brother Dong turned his gaze toward Tong Zhao. She was using the equipment for pull-ups, her arms and back engaging as she effortlessly pulled herself up. Those around her watched in awe, unable to believe how someone with her muscle mass could have such hardcore strength. While not quite at the level of "superhuman strength," her movements were incredibly light, as if the exercises were effortless for her.
 

 
But… "Exhausted?" Who are you kidding? Maybe you could fool a three-year-old.
 

 
The staff, caught in Brother Dong’s silent gaze, was speechless. He couldn’t blame Tong Zhao for not cooperating, as she didn’t know he was using her to convince Brother Dong. The staff was still trying to come up with a new excuse when Brother Dong smiled, curling his thin lips, and looked at the staff with an expression as if he had seen through their little scheme, yet still showing a tolerant smile. "I can sing."
 

 
His smile was warm.
 

 
Having just been outsmarted by Brother Dong, the staff was left with complicated feelings, turning them into four simple words: "Thank you, Brother Dong."
 

 
Fans in the livestream were excited to hear that Brother Dong would sing.
 

 
Some of the onlookers were about to leave.
 

 
But a portion of them knew that Brother Dong could sing well and wanted to hear him live—
 

 
Several of Brother Dong's songs had gone viral on Douyin, including "Sensual Lover" and "Stop Desire." Clicking on those songs, one could find hundreds of unique short videos showcasing abs and perfect timing with the music.
 

 
Once Tong Zhao finished letting Brother Dong win, she left the remaining time to herself.
 

 
The host asked Tong Zhao if she had ever heard Brother Dong sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and smiled, complimenting him: "It’s hard not to have heard of him!"
 

 
[Emotional Intelligence]
 

 
[Thank you, Sister Xiao, for praising our Brother Dong!]
 

 
[Brother Dong’s songs are good, but 'Stop Desire' is really too catchy. Every time I hear that BGM, I feel like a muscular man is about to jump out and pull up his shirt with a small whip.]
 

 
Brother Dong tilted his head: "Many people discovered my brainwashing songs through public loudspeakers on the subway and buses. Were you one of the victims?"
 

 
The air was still for a few seconds.
 

 
[Business Intelligence]
 

 
[The 'Emotional Intelligence' was written backwards, LOL.]
 

 
[So Brother Dong knows his songs are brainwashing!]
 

 
…
 

 
In the end, the livestream turned into a duet on the stage with the two of them singing a love song.
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao didn’t let another persona take over.
 

 
If the character "Consort Chen," who was best at singing, had taken over, the audience’s mood would have shifted. Tong Zhao’s singing skills weren’t bad; with more experience, her emotions were richer, bridging the gap with Brother Dong. Their two voices, which leaned toward a mature and sensual tone, perfectly expressed the emotions of "Stop Desire," even making them briefly forget that they were on a boxing ring, not a stage...
 

 
The audience was thrilled and said this time, they were truly hooked.
 

 
The promotional event came to a successful close.
 

 
Only Brother Dong, still upset, shot Tong Zhao one last glance after the livestream ended: "No next time?”
 

 
"No next time, I'm a female celebrity, not a fighter."
 

 
With one sentence, Tong Zhao shut down all of Brother Dong's thoughts.
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Being looked at with intense, affectionate eyes by a handsome guy, while he says he wants to "come again"—that experience was kind of new and intriguing. But if that "coming again" didn’t involve another fight, it would have been perfect. Just as the staff were organizing to go out for hotpot, Brother Dong missed his chance to talk to her again. The streetlight cast a warm, yellowish glow on his face, and his wet, shimmering eyes were filled with unspoken melancholy.
 

 
The moment their gazes met, Tong Zhao began to feel like the entertainment industry was a place where only the truly crazy survived.
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think we're still quite normal."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I should be the most abnormal one."
 

 
Han Zhi: "And the cutest one."
 

 
Other personalities agreed.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment and added a note: "That must also make me the most narcissistic."
 

 
...
 

 
Once the live broadcast and the subsequent data flow were out, Tang Yanhao, who played the male lead’s boyfriend Cheng Siwen in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, sent her a message.
 

 
Tang Yanhao: "Sis, I also want to get beaten up / crying/crying."
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. Could this be some kind of contagious mental state?
 

 
As Tang Yanhao explained, since the PK live broadcast, the audience had started to link Tong Zhao and Brother Dong together in ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, creating a mutually beneficial bond between them. Meanwhile, his character—the real "CP" in the film—was completely forgotten, and Tang Yanhao was so bitter that he planted a whole room full of lemon trees.
 

 
He wasn’t mad at Tong Zhao, but he was furious with Brother Dong.
 

 
How could that guy come up with such a publicity stunt?
 

 
But getting angry at Brother Dong was the most pointless thing in the world.
 

 
After thinking it over, Tang Yanhao’s lemon-juice-soaked brain came up with a dim-witted idea—
 

 
Since Brother Dong’s beating became a trending topic, why not replicate that classic stunt?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "…There’s really no need."
 

 
Tang Yanhao calmed down and thought it through.
 

 
The first person to take on the stunt is the one who creates the buzz, but the second one? It just seems like too much of a marketing gimmick.
 

 
Moreover, his image was different from Brother Dong's.
 

 
Tong Zhao comforted him: "The box office of the movie will benefit you too, plus you have more screen time."
 

 
Tang Yanhao wasn't very familiar with her and wasn’t at her level in the industry. He was a bit flattered by her comforting words and thanked her for her kindness, saying he would look forward to the box office.
 

 
But then, he added:
 

 
"Next time there’s an opportunity to get beaten up like this, be sure to call me!”
# Chapter99
Tang Yanhao wasn’t about to give up.
 

 
He was convinced that Tong Zhao was like a good-luck charm that naturally attracted attention, and he secretly hoped to soak up some of her spotlight.
 

 
How did he go about it?
 

 
Whenever Jiang Dang praised Tong Zhao, he would follow suit.
 

 
“Recently, Tong Zhao has pretty much become the center of attention. When people mention ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, they almost think of her by default. As a co-star in this film, what’s your take on her?”
 

 
Ever since Tong Zhao’s rise to fame, questions like these—intended to stir up conflict—had frequently been asked to other actors in the film. Jiang Dang usually acted a bit clueless with unexpected questions (because his manager, fearing he might go off-script, would pre-write responses and send them to him over WeChat to memorize). But when it came to this question, he became surprisingly chatty, praising Tong Zhao extensively.
 

 
And yet, not even his most jealous fans felt insecure about his admiration for her.
 

 
After all, Jiang Dang had put it like this:
 

 
“I really admire her. There’s probably a misunderstanding with the public—somehow, the only roles I get offered are villains, the kind that the protagonist is supposed to be terrified of. But I’m actually such a gentle, friendly person, you know? It’s strange; being on a movie set and actually feeling fear was a first for me. Tong Zhao gave me this brand-new experience. When she looked at me on set, I felt like she genuinely wanted to kill me. It was exhilarating—I’d love to experience that in real life a few more times… but…”
 

 
But?
 

 
Sensing a juicy twist, the journalist’s interest was instantly piqued, hoping to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao from her fellow cast members.
 

 
Journalist: “But what?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was tinged with a sense of wistful longing, almost as if he was caught in unrequited admiration. “In real life, there’s too big a gap in our abilities. She’s way too skilled, always in complete control, and I never felt the threat of actually being ‘killed.’”
 

 
“…?”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a subtle smile. “Still, there’s something interesting about that feeling of being toyed with. Gains and losses, I guess. Not something you get to experience every day.”
 

 
The reporter felt like a complete fool for thinking just a moment ago that they could extract any useful news from Jiang Dang's mouth.
 

 
This interview was so entertaining. The sense of connection between the two in the movie was even stronger, and Tang Yanhao was incredibly envious. He also wanted some of the spotlight. "I think this is pretty unfair."
 

 
Since his debut, Tang Yanhao had always maintained the image of a sunny, boy-next-door type. He spoke normally, with a bit of shy freshness, which entertainment reporters liked. Several reporters, hearing him mention "unfair" — a keyword that could stir up drama — immediately rushed to his side.
 

 
"Can you elaborate on what's unfair?"
 

 
"Is it bullying on set?"
 

 
"Did they get physical with you?"
 

 
It was getting a little out of hand.
 

 
With a look that clearly said, "What are you talking about, nonsense?" Tang Yanhao looked at the reporters and said:
 

 
"I think it's unfair that they didn't let me join in on the fighting competition. I want to play too."
 

 
"Bullying on set? What nonsense, Xiao Zhao treats me really well."
 

 
"Want me to complain about her? Fine, looks like I won't get out of here until I say something..."
 

 
Tang Yanhao thought for a moment, then came up with a set of words full of grievances: "She only fights Jiang Dang, never me. It's so biased. I’m clearly the top CP in her movie!" He almost slipped and said "crab legs CP," but thankfully stopped himself in time.
 

 
---
 

 
The entertainment reporters were beginning to feel that the actors from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ seemed a little off.
 

 
This interview allowed Tang Yanhao to gain a bit of the spotlight's fringe heat, and netizens jokingly called him the "most insignificant male lead" and urged him to hand over his secondary Weibo account – listening to him describe his "top CP" in such dramatic terms, he must have been shipping fanfiction couples all along!
 

 
However, this remains an unsolved mystery.
 

 
After all the questions, the reporter was unable to uncover any negative opinions about Tong Zhao within the crew, so they could only leave in frustration.
 

 
The girl's reputation among her colleagues was extraordinarily good.
 

 
When a few whispers did emerge, it was usually about how she didn’t engage much with others during breaks, often wearing an eye mask and pretending to sleep. However, other staff members would say, "What are you listening to? Tong Zhao is actually really nice. It's just that at first, when people tried to ask her which stock to buy for sure profits, she didn’t want to talk. Maybe that’s why some people held a grudge against her."
 

 
The reporter then remembered she also had the nickname of an investment genius.
 

 
The industry forecasted good box office numbers for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. Fans of action movies would definitely be satisfied, and the light, fun storyline was suitable for all ages. With director Shi’s and Director Deng’s subtle additions of personal touches, it also had some deeper layers, along with funny and contrasting moments to entertain the younger crowd…
 

 
However, the final box office of a movie is not always entirely determined by its quality.
 

 
Sometimes, it’s almost a mystical thing.
 

 
Most of the time, the reasons can only be inferred from the final box office results.
 

 
So, what would the box office trajectory of ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ look like?
 

 
…
 

 
On the day of its release, the top trending spot was occupied by ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
At first, this was probably due to its massive hype.
 

 
However, once it reached the top, it never dropped. The gap between it and the second-place romantic comedy had already widened by over three million, making the competition jealous. Within just half a day of its release, its box office was already heading straight for eight figures – who could handle this?
 

 
Real-time projections kept rising.
 

 
Both online and offline cinemas were filled with people chasing the trend.
 

 
There were no scheduling factors online, but the issue was the promotion slots – cinemas with higher box office numbers would receive more promotional boosts, which in turn sold more tickets.
 

 
What made this film so good? Critics were puzzled.
 

 
If we talk about quality, of course, it wasn’t lacking.
 

 
But before its release, many thought it might become Director Shi’s Waterloo because modern martial arts movies were quite rare, and Tong Zhao’s concept of "two subconsciouses" sounded like a marketing gimmick…
 

 
From a god’s-eye view of the cinemas and the real audience reviews, a hint of its appeal could be seen.
 

 
The cinemas were filled with constant laughter, and viewers were even mimicking martial arts moves in the hallways after the movie…
 

 
[The immersion is so great, I suspect the screenwriter is a wuxia author.]
 

 
[Is this a super high-class movie? No, it’s not. It’s something really special, and after watching it, you’ll want to see it again.]
 

 
[I think ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is way more artistic.]
 

 
[The biggest similarity between ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ and ‘The Heartless Tribulation’ is that they both look so satisfying. My six-year-old son is already calling for martial arts classes, but it doesn’t count toward school credits. It’s frustrating. I suggest parents secretly watch it without bringing their kids.]
 

 
In the data stream, the word "satisfying" appeared twice as often as "good."
 

 
The data doesn’t lie; it faithfully reflected the audience's feelings after watching the movie.
 

 
A movie that has depth, humor, and handsome men and beautiful women – a feel-good film whose box office far surpasses the tear-jerking tragic films. Indeed, a thought-provoking good movie can inspire the audience to think, spark discussions, and bring more new viewers into the theater. However, most people don’t want to cry twice for the same movie in the theater. Once you’ve seen a scene, it’s not as emotional the second time around.
 

 
Some of the lines written by Director Deng personally added depth to the film.
 

 
The movie's exploration of martial arts traditions came from the off-screen guidance of Director Deng from the Jingwu Martial Arts School.
 

 
The new era's interpretation of martial arts traditions, on the other hand, came from Tong Zhao’s subconscious improvisation.
 

 
Some audience members especially liked the intellectual clash between the protagonist, Xie Guiye, and the villain —
 

 
Fu Xuancheng was very angry, believing that the current era had forgotten the inheritance of Chinese martial arts, and that all the heroes had been abandoned by time.
 

 
Everyone, including the audience, thought that the protagonist, who had always shown a dislike for martial arts, would follow along and denounce traditional martial arts, but unexpectedly, Tong Zhao shook her head and replied, “What is martial arts? Swords, spears, halberds, axes, hooks, chains, whips, hammers, claws, sticks, staffs, and the meteor hammer – swordplay, sword techniques, knife techniques, and lightness skills. Being a hero is about eradicating evil and promoting good for the nation, not just learning some half-baked martial arts and cosplaying.”
 

 
Bullet comments:
 

 
[Xie Guiye hates martial arts, but can recite all 18 weapons. Brilliant!]
 

 
[This movie could also be called ‘Corporate Drones vs. Chuunibyou’]
 

 
Some sharp-eyed viewers noticed the subconscious shift in Tong Zhao’s character midway through and commented: [Early Xie Guiye: I’ll just criticize everything! Later Xie Guiye: I’ll just fight!]
 

 
…
 

 
@Instinct Film Scene: This entire March, a martial arts movie is dominating the screens! / Laughing and crying
 

 
It truly dominated the screens, with everyone talking about this movie.
 

 
Putting aside the continuous box office breakthroughs, the entire crew of the movie spent the entire month going to bed with smiles on their faces. While some discussed the box office, what really fascinated netizens were the various fan-made videos mimicking the main characters…
 

 
The leader of this trend was a Bilibili content creator named Shen Huo, who was said to be a male fan of Jiang Dang, with some rather unique ideas.
 

 
After ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ was released, Shen Huo organized an event to meet the top-ranked fan offline, including round-trip airfare. The number one fan turned out to be a female netizen, and his fans were immediately shocked and couldn't believe it. They were amazed, "Does Shen Huo really have female fans?" and began imagining a love story between the male broadcaster and the wealthy female fan.
 

 
The female fan really showed up.
 

 
So what was the mystery activity for the meetup?
 

 
It was an imitation of the classic battle moves between the protagonists, Xie Guiye and Fu Xuancheng.
 

 
*Click to Watch: The Classic Battle from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ Recreated: 100% Restoration!*
 

 
On the left, you have the original movie, with handsome men and beautiful women looking heroic.
 

 
On the right, you have an unenthused rich girl and a male host beaming with joy.
 

 
The amateur performers, with no martial arts background, had soft and weak moves, which was unintentionally hilarious.
 

 
[Don’t use the original movie to fool us!]
 

 
[Jiang Dang’s fans are terrifying in another sense…]
 

 
[Since you’re here, let me recommend our Shen Huo! Click on the creator’s album and check out the original songs!]
 

 
Well, this person is both messing around and singing.
 

 
After this meme spread widely, TikTok followed suit, with the most popular soundbite being "Master, this is a master!" The brainwashing voiceover became an almost spiritual pollution. If you hear it on a bus or subway and glance at someone’s phone screen, you’re almost certain to see scenes from ‘The Knives of the Maiden’.
 

 
Some core audiences thought this wave was very tacky, but it genuinely sparked more curiosity and led to more ticket sales...
 

 
With these spin-off memes so popular and the movie still in theaters, many decided to go watch it.
 

 
…
 

 
This expanded audience base later led to some hindsight criticism from certain movie critics…
 

 
"Analyzing Tong Zhao's Subconscious Success in Wealth Codes: A Walking Feel-Good Film Factory"
 

 
This review, shared over six thousand times, comes from a movie critic with millions of followers.
 

 
He summarized all of Tong Zhao’s movies, pulling out scenes from each one, and discovered that no matter how the script was written, her subconscious always turned the movie into a feel-good narrative. This is why the audience never gets tired of watching her—she has the same kind of comeback story as Cinderella, a timeless theme in storytelling.
 

 
The review hit the nail on the head regarding Tong Zhao's career and her fan base.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at it and felt that, to some extent, this person was right. The quick-paced, mission-completing characters she portrayed were indeed in line with the feel-good narrative style.
 

 
Along with the surge in box office and reputation, her market value skyrocketed.
 

 
The industry wondered, ‘Can she rise even more?’
 

 
During the time of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, her price was already sky-high, and she had decided to focus more on reducing her production and choosing higher-tier projects, unwilling to accept scripts she wasn’t interested in.
 

 
So, what kind of scripts does this box office queen like?
 

 
Inside Tong Zhao’s mind palace, a little one sat in the middle of the older siblings, feeling troubled in front of a pile of scripts.
 

 
Duan Ge: “Why not just forget it?”
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Zhao Zai protested loudly, then mumbled softly:
 

 
“Only you guys get to play… I also want to contribute something to my sister!”
 

 
Consort Chen glanced at her: “You staying put is your biggest contribution.”
 

 
The little one was struck down by this precise hit, her eyes brimming with tears. She was comforted in the arms of Elder Lu. Zhao Zai shook her head and clenched her small fist: “It’s okay, I will definitely pick the right script.”
# Chapter100
Due to certain radical tendencies, the success rate of completed missions had significantly dropped.
 

 
Thus, with her consent, the persona of “Xiao Zhao” was created.
 

 
Xiao Zhao was somewhat unique. She retained faint memories of the first three world-hopping missions, but everything was filtered through a thick layer of innocence. She remembered once captivating an entire kingdom with a smile, leading a group of loyal comrades to survive the apocalypse, and even being a top-tier heartthrob adored by countless fans...
 

 
But what did that have to do with a little elementary school girl who loved drinking milk and eating lollipops?
 

 
Xiao Zhao was puzzled.
 

 
However, her predecessors’ experiences weren’t useless.
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s mission was to reduce the blackening risk of three major villains.
 

 
These three villains couldn’t simply be reformed with love and kindness.
 

 
The first villain was destined to be a cold, future scientific mastermind with a nearly superhuman intellect. He saw even adults as intellectually inferior, almost a different species entirely. Compassion from someone so “primitive” meant nothing to him. Xiao Zhao thought it over and decided to try the nurturing approach based on her older sister, Consort Chen’s, experience.
 

 
Despite his extraordinary intellect, the young genius’s sense of beauty hadn’t mutated.
 

 
Like other boys his age, he still recognized beauty and was quite mature for his age.
 

 
And so... the little genius fell.
 

 
But Xiao Zhao, tasked with an important mission, couldn’t linger on one villain. Just as he gathered the courage to confess his early feelings, she politely declined, telling him that she not only admired boys who excel academically but especially those who aspired to contribute to the country as great scholars.
 

 
The young genius:?
 

 
Eventually, the young genius was reformed, becoming a leading scientist who contributed positively to society.
 

 
#The Daily Life of a Stoic Scientist with a Romantic Heart#
 

 
The second villain was set on a path of revenge, distorted by a mix of cowardice and inferiority. He was a troubled child, born to a gambling-addicted father and a mother who silently endured domestic abuse. One day, his usually gentle mother unexpectedly beat him harshly over a trivial matter, chasing him out of the house. Frightened, he wandered outside until late, finally returning to find his mother hanging lifeless and his father poisoned.
 

 
The truth was that his debt-ridden father, desperate to pay a 500,000 yuan loan shark debt, had decided to kill his family for the insurance money. Having been abused and stripped of any will to resist, his mother saw no other way to protect her son than this tragic choice.
 

 
From that day on, the boy’s capacity for genuine emotional connection was broken.
 

 
Whenever others showed him kindness, it only made him anxious; only money gave him comfort. He always remembered the debt his father tried to repay that night, and later on, he became infamous for elaborate financial scams, amassing a fortune.
 

 
Xiao Zhao took a different approach to intervene. She gently nudged his mother, suggesting there were other ways than total destruction. She encouraged her to report the abuse to the authorities, to reach out to family services, and to establish connections with neighbors, creating a support network.
 

 
Villain: “All my suffering is because of poverty.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “You’re absolutely right! Here’s a profitable path for you—given your intellect, it’s a sure thing!”
 

 
Villain:?
 

 
Thanks to this intervention, he switched to a wealth-building path, investing in stocks and achieving success legitimately.
 

 
The third villain was a beautiful girl born into a family with a strong preference for sons. Growing up in a toxic environment, she later became an accomplice in perpetuating the same harm she experienced. Her parents, captivated by her looks, pushed her into modeling as a child star, and as she entered the entertainment industry, she became highly successful but quickly descended into moral decay. She began recruiting other young women to exploit for wealthy clients, forgetting her original love for acting and her dream of being admired by all.
 

 
Xiao Zhao extended a hand of friendship to this “little sister.”
 

 
Under her family’s influence, the girl had low self-esteem. Despite Xiao Zhao’s encouragement, she struggled to feel pride in herself, facing the choice of either sinking further into harm or becoming a target for manipulation.
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Do you really need to rely on others to feel valued?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao: “Well, in that case, how about liking me instead?”
 

 
By becoming Xiao Zhao’s loyal “fan,” she found her self-worth.
 

 
Marriage for family honor? She only wanted to stay close to Xiao Zhao, so there was no need for that.
 

 
Buying a house for her brother? Maybe save for a castle for Xiao Zhao instead!
 

 
Xiao Zhao fulfilled her mission in this childlike seven-year-old “quick transmigration” world, reforming all three villains before their darker tendencies took root. Sadly, she couldn’t stay long enough to live a full life there, as the system transferred her to the next world before she could grow up—or date any of them!
 

 
…
 

 
Consort Chen prodded her soft, chubby cheek: “You look as intense as someone hustling for a phone screen protector under the bridge.”
 

 
Another poke.
 

 
The soft cheek dented slightly, and Consort Chen couldn’t resist poking again.
 

 
Finally, one poke too many, and Xiao Zhao snapped around, biting the tip of her finger.
 

 
It was the ultimate “look up and bite”!
 

 
Consort Chen: “...Let go.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao, mumbling with her mouth full: “Only if you stop poking my face.”
 

 
“Fine, fine, no more poking.”
 

 
Consort Chen reluctantly withdrew her hand, then elegantly wiped her fingertip on a silk handkerchief, brushing off imaginary saliva.
 

 
The scripts coming in for Tong Zhao were more varied than ever before.
 

 
In the past, most scripts were designed specifically for characters like Consort Chen and Duan Ge, with a few mixed in as attempts to get her to try unconventional roles as male protagonists. However, such bold requests were rare, and they were always small productions. Even if she was interested, the company could block her… Up until now, she’d been respectful of her manager’s opinions, and Han Zhi never pushed her to take on male roles.
 

 
Sometimes, he’d casually stream, chat with fans, and play games, practically becoming an ASMR streamer.
 

 
In short, no one was offering her child roles. Just as in traditional films, child characters in Instinct Films would still be played by real children. Since adults entering a child-modeled body carried an inherent discordance, it posed a high risk of incompatibility. Plus, there were plenty of kids willing to take on those roles.
 

 
As Zhao flipped through the scripts, her mood sank lower.
 

 
Just then, her phone rang, forcing her to pause and answer her agent’s call.
 

 
In her subconscious palace, Zhao lay like a defeated lump of rice cake in Lu Xianzhang’s embrace, her dreams crushed.
 

 
After explaining her new schedule, Sister Chu asked, “What are you up to? It’s awfully quiet.”
 

 
“Just reading through the scripts you sent me.”
 

 
Sister Chu wasn’t surprised; in fact, she was pleased with this response. Among her clients, Tong Zhao was by far the most hardworking.
 

 
“No rush. Or maybe look at some variety shows, if any interest you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked if she had any recommendations.
 

 
Sister Chu laughed and replied, “If I were to suggest something, take it with a grain of salt; your preferences are what matter. Based on your past films, the male leads have had low presence. Even when you’ve had love interests, they’ve ended up overshadowed by you. Like in ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where the male character was strong enough to hold his own, but only as a villain, not as a love interest. And in The Knives of the Maiden’, viewers felt Cheng Siwen wasn’t worthy of you—the main character is meant to shine alone.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s subconscious is more dominant than that of many famously strong male stars. It’s rare in East Asian culture, where female stars’ subconscious in Instinct Films often gravitates toward “completion” through marriage and children—a reflection of cultural influence.
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t have those thoughts, probably due to her strong sense of individuality formed during her transmigrations.
 

 
“There are critics who say your subconscious is too domineering; everyone’s eager to see you fall in love on screen.”
 

 
After sharing her thoughts, Chu quickly emphasized that she wasn’t pressuring Tong Zhao to take a romance-focused role. Tong Zhao was curious—she’d always known her company and manager respected her choices, so why the need for extra reassurance?
 

 
Sister Chu clarified:
 

 
“The industry now trusts your godly script-picking eye. The way every film you choose becomes a hit isn’t something analysis can explain—it has to be some kind of magic. I can’t mess with that magic!”
 

 
…
 

 
Magic, my foot!
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Superstitious nonsense.”
 

 
Sister Chu: “Someone saw you meditating at the gym during the last roadshow.”
 

 
…
 

 
Lu Xianzhang: [The feng shui in that spot is great.]
 

 
"Alright, then let’s try some magic."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled. After hanging up the phone, she playfully imagined herself as others saw her: she tossed all the scripts into the air, waiting for them to fall, then picked up the one closest to her.
 

 
"Neverland Girl (Working Title)"
 

 
It was, surprisingly, a romance movie.
 

 
"Neverland..."
 

 
The term “Neverland” originates from the 1904 story ‘Peter Pan’, a tale known worldwide. The protagonist, Peter Pan, is a boy who doesn’t want to grow up—and never will. The story revolves around him and a little fairy. According to urban legend, the original version wasn’t so cheerful. When the boys on Neverland began to grow up, they were killed by Peter Pan for the “crime” of betraying the island by maturing. [Note]
 

 
However, the truth of that version remains unclear.
 

 
The most official final version is a much happier one, where children spend a blissful time on Neverland but ultimately choose to return home to face life’s responsibilities. In reality, no one can avoid growing up—except Peter Pan, a fictional character. Neverland serves as a place within a fairytale that embodies the author’s nostalgia and sense of loss.
 

 
But this film clearly chose the darker version.
 

 
The female lead is a second child, born after her elderly parents lost their first daughter and did everything in their power to have another child. After the tragic loss of their eldest, her parents’ mental states were shaken, and the main character grew up drenched in their overprotective love. Shielded from the outside world in their countryside mansion, she barely saw anyone else, and her parents were happy to see their little princess safe under their watchful eyes.
 

 
One day, she accidentally fell into a pond and, after being rescued, lost her memory.
 

 
She transformed into a child trapped within an adult’s body.
 

 
Her elderly parents were devastated, both by their inability to ignore their daughter’s condition and by their declining health, which made it impossible to keep her all to themselves. They spared no expense in hiring a doctor to treat her, and the story unfolds between doctor and patient, with the girl falling in love with him…
 

 
That’s the main storyline.
 

 
On the hidden side, the script reveals that before losing her memory, the female lead had somehow managed to acquire an unmonitored phone. Through it, she began to sense that her life wasn’t quite normal. Yet, understanding her parents’ grief and deep love for her, she chose to endure it.
 

 
But, as they say, using the internet without falling in love is a waste of bandwidth…
 

 
Through the phone, she fell in love.
 

 
Love became a trigger for her free will to awaken. After testing her parents’ reactions, she felt hopeless, believing her desire to leave home was a betrayal. But unable to ignore her yearning for freedom, she ultimately decided to drown herself in the pond.
 

 
That incident wasn’t an accident at all.
 

 
And the doctor wasn’t a real doctor, either.
 

 
He was actually a top-notch con artist who’d dropped out of high school—and also her online boyfriend.
 

 
If her parents had hired someone through normal means, they might have gotten a real doctor. But their exhaustive hiring process played perfectly into the hands of this seasoned con man.
 

 
The male lead, who refused to grow up and shunned responsibility, crosses paths with the female lead, who was forced to stay a child. In the secluded mansion, the two rekindle a strange connection and explore the meaning of growing up.
 

 
…
 

 
After finishing the script, Tong Zhao had only one thought:
 

 
“Maybe I really do have magical powers.”
# Chapter101
Tong Zhao sent the ‘Neverland Girl’ script to her agent.
 

 
She didn’t even glance at the crew members already attached to the project. After all, Sister Chu had previously told her that as long as she chose scripts she liked, everything else would fall into place. Any movie with her name attached would easily attract investors; many people wanted to work with her. That said, prominent male stars were often hesitant to collaborate with her—industry gossip claimed that working alongside her was never a win-win for male actors, and they merely ended up supporting her. Actresses, on the other hand, might have a chance to create an intriguing sisterly bond with her on screen.
 

 
There were even rumors that Tong Zhao was a lesbian.
 

 
She couldn’t care less about these tabloid rumors. Those sensational gossip columns, lacking any hard evidence, were filled with outrageous claims about her. According to their stories, she was attending eight social dinners a week, rumored to be involved with nine other entertainers—three of whom were allegedly women. They claimed the entire Zeshan crew was her “harem” and that she was so distraught by her fame she was contemplating suicide daily.
 

 
Without proof, none of it held much weight.
 

 
A luxury cast? No worries. With "Tong Zhao" on the bill, her name alone equaled a top-tier production.
 

 
She had already mentally prepared herself for the possibility of liking the script but ending up with a subpar production team. However, as soon as she sent the script to Sister Chu, she received a quick reply—six ellipses.
 

 
Puzzled, Tong Zhao asked and discovered the situation was worse than expected.
 

 
Unbelievable! Aside from the script, there was only a producer.
 

 
The producer was very young, with only one previous project to his name, which had completely flopped. As a result, he couldn’t even attract a director this time. How the project had gotten this far was anyone’s guess. After some thought, Sister Chu recalled, “I remember thinking the script was good at the time; I figured you might like it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “I do like it.”
 

 
“But,” she added, “no investment, no director, and no cast? Even though the script is great, it’s a bit beneath my standing.”
 

 
She had to consider the entire team.
 

 
Sister Chu assumed she was ready to drop the project, but Tong Zhao continued, “Give me the producer’s contact information. I’ll invest in this film myself.”
 

 
Sister Chu was stunned. “What are you planning to do now?”
 

 
“These instinct-driven films burn through money fast,” she warned. “Going up even a little in quality can easily cost the price of multiple homes… Besides, if you just express interest in taking the role, finding investors shouldn’t be an issue.”
 

 
Initially, Tong Zhao had just spoken on impulse.
 

 
This was the kind of script perfect for Zhao Zai. Not only did she want to act in it, but she wanted it to be made into a truly great film.
 

 
Who doesn’t dream of traveling back in time to give their younger self the care they deserve?
 

 
Righting past regrets, having that toy they never got, or fulfilling a dream—this was a chance for her adult self to become her childhood hero.
 

 
"Found anyone?"
 

 
"Don’t even mention a director—we can’t even find supporting actors. Whenever people hear the name Xu Yiming, they just want to run."
 

 
In China, the concept of a producer differs a bit from Hollywood. Often, directors end up handling producer tasks, but Xu Yiming is more of a traditional producer, frequently joking about being the "film industry foreman." He had reached out to countless people, casting a wide net out of sheer determination. He had held on this long because he genuinely believed in the ‘Neverland Girl’ script and desperately wanted to see it made into a film and then watch the finished product in theaters, knowing he had been the one to piece it together.
 

 
At a street stall, empty beer cans littered the ground beneath their table.
 

 
Xu Yiming had a strong tolerance for alcohol. Even after downing a case of beer with friends, he was still speaking in flawless Mandarin, though a hint of melancholy crept into his words. “I just don’t want this good script to gather dust. But if no one’s willing to shoot it, what can I do? I used up all my connections with ‘Blood Battle’, and now even my reputation won’t get me anywhere…”
 

 
“To be honest, if selling myself would help, I’d be willing to do it.”
 

 
His drinking buddy shook his head, joking, “Three cents won’t get you far.”
 

 
Hearing that his looks were only worth three cents made Xu Yiming even more dejected.
 

 
His friend cracked open a bottle of baijiu and poured a shot, saying, “Stop thinking about useless things. Just drink.”
 

 
Just as Xu Yiming was about to take the glass, his phone chimed.
 

 
“Got a message from the work group chat—let me check it first,” he said.
 

 
When Xu Yiming looked at his phone, he didn’t expect much. He figured it was just another polite rejection—someone else saying their schedule was full, or they didn’t feel capable of doing justice to the script. In reality, they just didn’t want to take on a project without a clear profit potential. Xu didn’t blame them; he blamed himself for being unable to pull things together.
 

 
But as he looked down at his phone, he froze.
 

 
He reread the message several times, sobering up in the process.
 

 
His drinking buddy, noticing how Xu kept staring at his phone and muttering, "This can’t be real…" was curious. "What’s going on? A few beers and you can’t even read Chinese?"
 

 
Xu Yiming flipped his phone around and showed him the message.
 

 
His friend was stunned.
 

 
"Wait, this Tong Zhao—is this ‘the’ Tong Zhao? Holy…!"
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s name left him momentarily speechless, in complete shock.
 

 
"Yeah, it’s her." Xu Yiming, seeing his friend more shocked than he was, actually felt a bit calmer. But he was still confused—he knew of Manager Chu, a well-known agent. By some miracle, one of her artists could take an interest in his project, but Tong Zhao? She was the kind of star directors would scramble to please. How did he get so lucky?
 

 
Not only did he get her interest, but she even mentioned investing.
 

 
What on earth was going on?
 

 
This felt like a gift from the heavens, with a golden ingot tucked inside.
 

 
A cold breeze swept through the street stall, but Xu Yiming’s face was flushed with excitement. He quickly typed up a reply, while his friend didn’t mind being ignored. Instead, he sat next to Xu, watching him negotiate and marveling, "Man, if Tong Zhao’s interested in your project, you must have just used up a lifetime of good luck. When we order a designated driver later, let’s not share a car. I’m worried you might get in an accident."
 

 
"Screw you!"
 

 
…
 

 
Despite his harsh words, Xu Yiming’s heart was racing. After getting Tong Zhao’s contact info and discussing her thoughts on the project, he decided to spend the night at a nearby budget hotel instead of going home.
 

 
Tong Zhao liked his project.
 

 
Tong Zhao wanted to invest.
 

 
Tong Zhao even offered to post in her social circle to see if she could find suitable collaborators?
 

 
This level of luck—he genuinely feared he’d be crushed by a falling sign if he drove home.
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao reviewed her finances; funding a low-budget romance film wouldn’t be a problem. But she wasn’t in a rush and told Xu Yiming to wait a bit.
 

 
Wait for what?
 

 
Wait for the final box office results of ‘The Knives of the Maiden.’
 

 
This well-crafted movie was also superbly marketed, with industry experts saying that Zhao’s self-made buzz had boosted it from a solid 7/10 to an 8.5 box office success. Some in the industry dismissed analytical explanations entirely, attributing it to sheer "Zhao magic."
 

 
But it wasn’t magic.
 

 
Audience appeal is a mysterious thing, and after her roles in ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘Heartless Tribulation,’ the name Tong Zhao now stood for one thing in people’s minds—her films wouldn’t be boring.
 

 
With immersive holographic viewings being the main draw of the box office, people were willing to pay good money to experience something truly unique.
 

 
Tong Zhao had become a guarantee of this unique viewer experience.
 

 
When one film succeeded, every subsequent one seemed destined for success as well. She had become a brand of sorts, an unofficial “logo” that assured audiences. Her peers in the same age range could only watch with envy, frustrated that there was nothing they could do to keep up.
 

 
Male stars initially found it amusing, until they realized that the quarter's top box-office film was once again hers. In her movies, male co-stars frequently got overshadowed, leaving some of them feeling a bit sore about it.
 

 
And ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ delivered an undeniable box-office milestone, reaching an impressive 3 billion under the enthusiastic support of her fans.
 

 
What were her competitors saying? Tong Zhao and her team didn’t care. Anyone could see that her trending keywords on search engines and social media far surpassed those of her peers. The numbers solidified her commercial value; if others once thought her fame depended on the acclaim of director Shi Dingjun, now people simply said that Shi had found the perfect lead.
 

 
Nobody else could have delivered the same impact in those climactic scenes and action sequences as her character, Duan Ge, did.
 

 
With data transparency in the post-immersive-cinema era, the usual tricks fans used to inflate numbers were ineffective. An artist’s commercial worth could now be measured directly through keywords and other data points, using straightforward formulas. It wasn’t magic or hype. Audiences genuinely were drawn to Tong Zhao’s name and willingly bought tickets for her films.

“I swear, they might as well title the next film ‘Tong Zhao’ already! Every piece of promo material is plastered with her name—did she pay off the whole PR team or what?”
 

 
“It’s impossible to browse online anymore. Open up any social media feed, and it’s all her. Are there seriously no fans getting tired of this?”
 

 
“I’m done. Going to my dance class. For the sake of my sanity, staying off the internet.”
 

 
These complaints echoed quietly among industry insiders.
 

 
One young assistant, trying to show off his inside scoop, whispered, “I heard Tong Zhao’s team plans to cut back her exposure once the movie's run ends. No more variety shows or interviews, maybe…” But he didn’t get to finish before a senior colleague shot him a withering glare.
 

 
They were still competing fiercely for variety show bookings, and he had the nerve to talk about Zhao’s team planning to scale back exposure?
 

 
What kind of movie star “humblebrag” was this?
 

 
Yet, his insider tip was right. Apart from a brief appearance at the celebration event, Tong Zhao withdrew to focus on reading scripts.
 

 
There was a reason ‘Neverland Girl’ had been turned down by so many actresses. The role required the protagonist to convey an intense sense of growing up as she regained her memory. This transformation, easily captured in traditional films, posed a unique challenge in immersive cinema. In other words, the script wasn’t particularly suited for this new format—just something the producer happened to love.
 

 
But as luck would have it, the project struck a personal chord with Tong Zhao.
 

 
She posted to her social circle:
 

 
"Thinking of making a romance film myself. Right now, it’s just me as the lead actress—no director yet."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied: “Director reporting in.”
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Signing up for the male lead.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: “Count me in, I’m interested.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo's agent: "No, you don't.”
# Chapter102
The agent really wasn’t thrilled about Song Wanzhuo working with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It wasn’t that he had anything against Tong Zhao—in fact, he, like Wanzhuo, was captivated by her portrayal of the noble concubine, completely spellbound. But from a business perspective, Tong Zhao’s subconscious dominance in sensory films was so overpowering that male roles barely stood a chance. Back in ‘Emperor Ming’, this was less apparent since the emperor’s character retained prominence, but audiences couldn’t help but notice how much they were drawn to her as the noble concubine, despite her limited screen time.
 

 
After that, everyone in the industry knew: she’s an attention magnet. Working with her wouldn’t boost male co-stars’ popularity at all. Jiang Dang, with his unique and intense subconscious presence, had been an exception, but as far as Song Wanzhuo’s agent was concerned, they couldn’t count on that. He knew his client’s strengths; Wanzhuo’s subconscious traits were calm and understated, ideal for serious male-centric roles, but he didn’t have the emotional pull for romance films. Involving him in this genre would be career suicide, so the agent was determined to hold him back.
 

 
The agent privately messaged him: “You haven’t even read the script and you’re saying you want in? Didn’t you just tell me yesterday you were going to be more selective?”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, “Who could resist Tong Zhao’s charm?”
 

 
His agent tried to bring him back to reality: “You can’t be this reckless!”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s response was a casual, “I’m just an Easy Boy.”
 

 
The agent, realizing he was out of options, told him, “Fine, go talk to her. But don’t think she’ll necessarily want you, and remember—don’t agree to a low fee, no doing this for free.”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo thought his agent was underestimating him. Sure, he liked her performance as the noble concubine, but as long as she didn’t act that irresistibly charming way around him, he’d be fine. He was completely rational about this.
 

 
So, he requested the script.
 

 
Xu Yiming, who had just woken up at the hotel, nearly had a heart attack when he saw Song Wanzhuo’s friend request notification.
 

 
Good thing he didn’t actually have a heart condition.
 

 
Finding out that Song Wanzhuo was considering auditioning for his movie made Xu decide to stay an extra couple of days at the hotel—no way was he risking the walk back!
 

 
---
 

 
From the title alone, ‘Neverland Girl’ suggested that the story’s focus would revolve around the female lead, fitting right in with Tong Zhao’s preference for script selection.
 

 
But upon closer look, the male lead's character was actually crafted with considerable care.
 

 
The male lead is a seasoned con artist, a man who can deceive just about anyone. With his striking appearance, he easily gains others' trust and favor. Using clever language and manipulation, he makes people think he has connections and influence, which leads them to go out of their way to please him. For instance, he once tricked the owner of a struggling luxury hotel into believing he had ties to major corporations and could bring in lucrative business deals.
 

 
The hotel, though in decline, was still fairly upscale, and the owner, desperate to turn things around, showered the male lead with perks—including expensive gifts, a stay in the presidential suite, and a tab for dining and entertainment expenses—all because he thought the lead was networking on his behalf.
 

 
After enjoying the perks, selling off the gifts, and making the most of his stay, the male lead vanished without a trace.
 

 
Since he left no incriminating evidence in their black-and-white chat logs, and the owner had eagerly offered the gifts without hesitation, there was no legal recourse. The lead was careful never to push too far with any single "mark," knowing exactly how much he could get without driving anyone to a breaking point or risking a showdown.
 

 
He knew these wealthy people, well-off and educated, wouldn’t waste too much time on a con artist. In this, he felt both pride and self-loathing.
 

 
On one hand, he found it amusing how easily he could fool these people, how transparent their psychological weaknesses were to him. On the other, he was acutely aware that he lacked their level of education and sophistication.
 

 
If he were the type to believe that “education is useless,” he might have felt more at peace. But this is where the male lead's self-awareness becomes his curse—he knows the value of knowledge, he knows education matters, and he envies those students who can study freely on campus, unburdened by life.
 

 
“He’s the kind of lead that gives you a feeling of ‘something’s not right,’” Song Wanzhuo muttered to himself as he analyzed the character, instinctively envisioning how his own subconscious traits would interpret the role, as any actor would. “He has a sort of self-destructive mindset…”
 

 
The male lead meets the female lead when he hears about some online scams and decides to try his hand.
 

 
In the world of con artists, he’s a ‘real-life success’ type.
 

 
After all, with his looks, his captivating voice, and his persuasive body language, he can easily gain people's trust. Typing on the internet, though, comes off a bit cold and unconvincing to him. He'd heard about a scam called a "pig butchering scheme" that supposedly makes big money, and he found it intriguing.
 

 
The most common form of a pig butchering scheme is a romance scam. Scammers build a relationship with their target, then persuade them to invest or gamble on a specific app. The victim, believing they'll make a fortune, sometimes even takes out loans to continue. Under the scammer's influence, they’re convinced that it's a sure bet with no risks, often ending up deeply in debt and completely devastated.
 

 
On his very first attempt, he encounters the female lead.
 

 
The female lead, with her open-hearted trust in people and her eager, optimistic outlook on life, is everything he lacks.
 

 
And there’s a certain innocent naiveté about her.
 

 
He often finds it hard to believe that in this "5G era" there could be such a clueless girl.
 

 
He convinces himself that she knows a lot about the lifestyle of the wealthy and can teach him about expensive tastes and knowledge he might use in future scams. This justification keeps him from actually scamming her.
 

 
The "romance" scam ends at the stage of "falling in love."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh, come on!"
 

 
Are you really trying to scam her? Or are you just tempted by her innocence?
 

 
The female lead eventually shares her real background, revealing how trapped she feels in her family’s cage of "love." She’s afraid of the outside world but longs to escape, torn between her desire for freedom and her unwillingness to hurt her parents. Just listening to the male lead talk about the outside world brings her joy.
 

 
The outside world? How is he supposed to explain his life to her?
 

 
Tell her he’s just a conman with no real job, and barely any education?
 

 
The male lead doesn’t even know what a “normal” life looks like. He comes from a very dysfunctional family—his parents divorced, each remarried, and his father would hit him whenever they met, saying that if he scared him enough, he wouldn't come around asking for money. His father would tell him to go to his mother for support. But his mother was also struggling to survive; she’d remarried and quickly became pregnant again, trying to secure her place in her new family.
 

 
Asking his impoverished mother for money was out of the question, so he had no choice but to rely on himself.
 

 
He doesn't view his troubled background as an excuse for his crimes. He knows that no one's money is easily earned—he just doesn’t care anymore. Inside, there’s a rebellious child who uses his intelligence to live recklessly.
 

 
The script’s description of the male lead’s background is rich, but the narrative downplays it.
 

 
From the perspective of the female lead, who grew up pampered, everything seems rosy.
 

 
After a suicide attempt that results in amnesia, she’s like Alice wandering into a magical world—innocent, pure, and beautiful. Eventually, a handsome and elegant doctor pulls her out of this "dream," reminding her of her long-forgotten desire for freedom. Excitedly, she asks the male lead, "So, you’re here to take me away, right?"
 

 
The male lead looks at her quietly for a moment, then tells her another truth.
 

 
He reveals his real identity and the true nature of the world he knows:
 

 
Male Lead (calmly): "The world outside isn’t as colorful and fun as I described. It’s full of wolves like me, people with bad intentions. Part of the reason I encouraged you to run away was because I wanted to see you lose your innocence. I’m full of malice, do you understand? The boyfriend you’ve been so fond of—that’s who he really is. And the people you don’t like? They’re even uglier."
 

 
Male Lead: "Your parents may have a strong need to control you, but you have a good life. You have the luxury of never having to grow up."
 

 
The male lead thinks that if he continues using his cleverness just to get by, he’ll never be worthy of such a wonderful girl. There’s no such thing as a boy who can't grow up; there's only a boy who hasn’t met the girl he wants to be responsible for.
 

 
He also knows that because of his past recklessness, he doesn’t deserve to compete for this little princess’s love.
 

 
The weight of everything he’s shared is too much for the female lead to process all at once. She’s stunned for days, and by the time she regains her senses, he’s already gone.
 

 
This leads into the "real-world" storyline: the rosy lens of the luxury estate fades, and he returns to the cold, gray concrete jungle. The male lead finds a legitimate job, attends night classes to improve himself, and scrapes together money to repay his past victims, with interest. He wants to erase the fact that this girl he once adored had fallen for a con artist.
 

 
So, this character who seemed like a prince for four-fifths of the film is now working in sales. He has to meet performance targets and study late into the night.
 

 
The male lead used to believe he’d be a con artist forever.
 

 
The lessons he learned from the female lead don’t go to waste. Slowly, he finds his way and puts his life back on track. When things are tough, he imagines the little princess, living carefree in that lavish estate...
 

 
Reading up to this point, Song Wanzhuo feels the same way.
 

 
But then he reaches the three possible endings…
 

 
1. First Ending: After the male lead confesses the truth, the female lead's view of the world shatters, and she decides to retreat back into the safe, warm nest of her parents. Her controlling parents gain an even more obedient daughter, and she soon forgets the “doctor” who had vanished so abruptly. When she reaches a suitable age, they arrange a match with a well-connected young man, and she has a multimillion-dollar wedding that makes the news—something the male lead catches on TV.
 

 
2. Second Ending: After a brief period of fear, the female lead’s curiosity about the real world only grows stronger. She has a huge fight with her parents, finally gaining her independence. The male lead was right—her parents truly love her but were unaware their parenting style was flawed. Though her rebellion initially hurts them, it ultimately leads to a healthier and lasting parent-child relationship.
 

 
The female lead quickly catches up on over 20 years of real-world knowledge and eventually sets out to find the male lead.
 

 
But by the time she finds him, he has already died from overwork.
 

 
At that point, he’s managed to pay off his debts entirely, leaving behind only a final letter for her.
 

 
At this point, Song Wanzhuo feels a pang in his stomach.
 

 
3. Third Ending: This one is similar to the second, but when the female lead finds him, she realizes that he’s lost his glow. The boy she once loved was an illusion, and instead, the male lead has indirectly helped her complete her last stage of “growth.”
 

 
The prince was a lie, and reality is the dragon.
 

 
After leaving the castle, the little princess is able to pick up her own sword.
 

 
The agent, having finished the script as well, messages Song Wanzhuo: "Wanzhuo, I actually think you'd be a great fit to play the super controlling dad."
 

 
Song Wanzhuo: "?!"
 

 
Since love stories are challenging within the instinctual film genre, having multiple endings is fairly typical. Song Wanzhuo thinks over the male lead’s complex character and, betting on Tong Zhao’s streak of hits… even if he doesn’t gain much, boosting the box office numbers could be worth it!
 

 
So, he sends in his interest for the role.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo felt pretty confident. After all, Tong Zhao's films typically don't make the male lead a big draw, so there shouldn't be that many male stars eager to play the part, right?
 

 
Well, he was wrong.
 

 
Quite a few actors started asking if Tong Zhao was really going to do a romance film, and if the male lead would actually have a lot of screen time—or would it ultimately turn into a mystery thriller? Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh at all the questions, realizing she should probably start lining up a director to let them handle the casting headaches.
 

 
Fortunately, finding a director wouldn’t be too hard.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had already expressed a genuine interest in directing the film.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I'm thinking about financing the film myself. Romance films tend to be costly and hard to break even on, so I don’t plan to take on any other investors."
 

 
Director Shi was known throughout the industry for making only high-budget films.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Which makes it all the more interesting!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It would be my first time directing a film with a budget of only forty million. I’m really curious to see what it’s like to work with such a cash-strapped production!"
 

 
…
 

 
You can't help but think, if it weren’t for his money, how has this guy managed to live this long without someone taking a swing at him?
# Chapter103
Low-budget production means low tolerance for mistakes.
 

 
At the very least, there would be no room for the luxury that Director Shi Qianqiu had when filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’, where he could simply reshoot scenes when they didn’t come out perfectly.
 

 
When Tong Zhao reminded him of this, he sent back a wide-eyed, startled cat meme, looking left and right. What kind of reaction was that?
 

 
Picture this: like telling a high-roller accustomed to casual online games that they’ll now have to play a subscription-based game. “Sorry, dear, our game doesn’t have auto-navigation, and spending money won’t make you stronger.” Imagine the look of shock on their face—that’s the vibe Shi Qianqiu was giving off.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Just messing with you.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Do I look like the kind of fool who wouldn’t think of something so basic?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Like a rich person with no common sense.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [Not talking to you. (Cat meme)]
 

 
…
 

 
How much does this guy love using cat memes?
 

 
Tong Zhao sent him the script, telling him to think it over.
 

 
After putting her phone down, she headed to the bathroom, filled the tub with hot water and added some bath salts, ready to enjoy a relaxing soak.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found Tong Zhao absolutely fascinating.
 

 
If anyone else were self-funding a film for the first time, and he expressed interest in directing, they’d probably jump at the chance—after all, just having Shi Qianqiu’s name on a film guarantees ticket sales and a solid return on investment.
 

 
It wasn’t arrogance; it was simply the objective reality based on the reputation Shi Qianqiu’s movies had built over time.
 

 
A third-rate director has to beg for investments, while a first-rate director has investors lining up to hand over their money.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought Tong Zhao was interesting, but not in an arrogant way, “she’s the only actress who isn’t fawning over me, and now she has my attention” way. No, he was genuinely intrigued by this unconventional person who seemed to pave her own path. It made him want to follow her journey—to work with her on a creative project, which promised a new, doubled sense of freshness and excitement!
 

 
Based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Shi Qianqiu had only self-actualization left to pursue.
 

 
“Let’s take a look at the script first.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu rotated his wrist, and the text from the script projected into the air from his smart watch.
 

 
The latest model was surprisingly stable, allowing him to work on his own tasks while viewing the document.
 

 
…
 

 
When Tong Zhao came out of the bathroom, steam enveloped her face, giving her an air of lazy softness, as if the warmth had soaked into her very nerves. She lazily toweled off her hair with a blow dryer while glancing at her phone, wondering what silly thing Shi Qianqiu had said this time.
 

 
It wasn't easy to keep up with everything.
 

 
Ever since she posted that social media update and word got out that she intended to personally fund a romance film and star in it herself, her work messages had been non-stop.
 

 
Most of them required serious replies.
 

 
Fortunately, those who managed to merit Tong Zhao’s attention were generally polite and professional—no one was too pushy over a movie with an uncertain future. As for work acquaintances she barely remembered, she just replied uniformly: “There won’t be many roles in this new project. Details will be handled once we find the right director. I’m just providing the funding and acting; everything else is yet to be decided.”
 

 
If anyone pressed further, she ignored them.
 

 
Some messages were purely out of genuine concern, like from Director Shi and several other established figures in the film industry who told her not to hesitate to ask if she needed help from any of her mentors.
 

 
Tong Zhao believed they were sincere.
 

 
But ‘Neverland Girl’ had no action elements, so she could only politely acknowledge their kindness.
 

 
She scrolled down to Shi Qianqiu’s message window.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “The script is quite romantic.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “Recently, no major romance films have been hits. Compared to blockbuster effects-driven films, the success of romance at the box office is always a bit of a gamble. At least half of the industry investors have no clue what kind of love story can genuinely move audiences.”
 

 
Seeing this made Tong Zhao chuckle.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu talking about romance?
 

 
The message was sent a while ago, but it was as if Shi Qianqiu had predicted her reaction and preemptively added:
 

 
“Don’t laugh. Just because I’m not interested in romance doesn’t mean I’m clueless.”
 

 
“There’s still a demand for romance films. If you can release a quality one at this time… hmm, is this part of your plan? Market research done? No wonder they call you the Midas of the industry.”
 

 
Although the "Midas touch" nickname had a hint of sarcasm, Tong Zhao found that, under Shi Qianqiu’s analysis, her project selection actually sounded incredibly sensible. In just a few sentences, he outlined a profitable path forward!
 

 
She knew that Shi Qianqiu had often taken on the producer role for his past films as well.
 

 
If he weren’t already wealthy, he would have made a fantastic fundraiser.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t boast about his skill or claim he could guarantee box office success. Instead, he simply and sincerely discussed the film’s potential with her. Nothing mattered more than having a director who truly understood film, and after their chat, Tong Zhao made up her mind and happily created a group chat.
 

 
Meanwhile, Xu Yiming was enjoying a meal at a fast-food place near his home.
 

 
He figured it was about time to head back.
 

 
Ever since the news got out, everyone he knew suddenly switched their tone, trying to buddy up to him. Xu Yiming knew full well that while they might be currying favor with him, the real attraction was the "Tong Zhao" brand. He might have been pleased, but he didn’t bother with any "you didn’t care for me before, but now you can’t reach me" speeches.
 

 
Still, he figured that since there was no shortage of candidates, he could skip over those who had previously rejected him and weren’t particularly outstanding.
 

 
It’s easy enough to find general crew members, but finding a good director is tough.
 

 
With a sigh, Xu Jianming, who was in the middle of lamenting his baldness, suddenly got a notification that he’d been added to a new group chat.
 

 
He looked down.
 

 
"[Tong Zhao] invited you to join the group chat. Other participants: Shi Qianqiu."
 

 
?
 

 
Tong Zhao: "This is the director I found."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "For the male lead, I want final veto power. Everything else is up to you."
 

 
She said “up to you,” but in reality, she was planning to observe quietly.
 

 
When it comes to making films, Shi Qianqiu certainly has more experience than she does. Watching him up close as he oversees the production, from start to finish, would surely teach her a lot. As for her veto right over the lead actor, Shi Qianqiu readily agreed; in romance films, this kind of decision-making is quite standard...
 

 
If one of the main roles is played by a big star, then ideally, the casting of their on-screen partner would at least match that star’s aesthetic taste without clashing with the character’s personality. Otherwise, any visible tension or indifference would only feel awkward once filming began.
 

 
Both of them approached this rationally and methodically, leaving Xu Yiming completely baffled.
 

 
…
 

 
Wait—Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He rubbed his eyes. Was he seeing this right? This was the most unlikely director to recruit! Everyone knew that Director Shi always preferred to write, direct, and fund his own projects. How could a small-budget film with a $40 million budget possibly get him on board? It wouldn’t even be enough for him to go wild with.
 

 
Xu Yiming didn’t dare bring this up; he was too afraid of scaring off his idol.
 

 
He controlled his excitement, added Shi Qianqiu as a friend, and checked his social media to confirm that, indeed, this was the acclaimed director he had dreamed of working with. Exhaling with relief, he suddenly found the humble snacks in front of him tasted like Michelin-starred cuisine.
 

 
No need to go home.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu on board? His luck must be so good that it’d be safer to stay indoors, avoiding any chance of a freak accident.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao’s phone buzzed with a video call from Jiang Dang.
 

 
A video call?! Who even does that these days? A regular call would’ve been intimate enough. Tong Zhao was a bit taken aback, but since she’d just finished her bath, changed clothes, and blow-dried her hair, she answered without any hesitation.
 

 
On her screen appeared Jiang Dang’s strikingly beautiful, almost surreal face.
 

 
"I'm here to audition," he said.
 

 
On-screen, Jiang Dang was in casual clothes, with a guitar hanging on the wall behind him at home. When he appeared publicly, his team always paid careful attention to his appearance—his manager insisted that since his intellect was a bit off, his looks should make up for it. Jiang Dang looked effortlessly stunning in anything he wore, with a presence that made him an instant heartthrob for countless fans. His aura exuded a certain cold, forbidden charm.
 

 
Although he was somewhat absent-minded, his deep, soulful eyes captivated anyone who saw him.
 

 
With a serious tone, Jiang Dang began analyzing the benefits of them working together.
 

 
First, he explained, their “couple” pairing from The Knives of the Maiden had gained huge popularity; in online communities, many fans perceived their on-screen chemistry as undeniable. By announcing their collaboration now, they could capitalize on the previous film’s momentum.
 

 
Second, he added, he was very emotionally expressive—after all, the fact that he had written so many beloved love songs was proof enough.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s voice was low and melancholic, but his words were pure business.
 

 
He actually made a solid case.
 

 
Despite their characters being hero and villain in the film (with the hero having an official boyfriend), their pairing had somehow amassed a surprising following. Fans adored it, and video editors loved splicing their scenes together. With so many press events and promotional tours featuring them together, for fans, this was the proof of an undeniable romance!
 

 
If they worked together again, the buzz would be instantaneous.
 

 
After listening to his pitch, Tong Zhao replied, "You recited that very naturally."
 

 
Jiang Dang looked at her with a slightly innocent expression and replied without missing a beat, "My manager was worried I might say the wrong thing and offend you."
 

 
His answer made Tong Zhao laugh. Did people really find her that intimidating?
 

 
Jiang Dang really had the face of a villain.
 

 
Tong Zhao stopped laughing and asked, "But do you really want to make another movie with me? Or did your team send you here?"
 

 
In Tong Zhao's eyes, Jiang Dang now appeared to be the obedient, team-following good boy, almost like someone who was resigned to his fate. Of course, if his manager heard this, they’d probably feel wrongly accused... Jiang Dang, in reality, only obeyed when it suited him. When he was stubborn, he could be quite rebellious.
 

 
Tong Zhao, sensing the situation, warned, "You’re not planning on getting beaten up, are you? My next film doesn’t involve any fighting!"
 

 
She genuinely feared that Jiang Dang might say something like, "Sister, take me in."
 

 
The kind of relationship implied by that phrase in certain circles.
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang laughed, amused by her cautious tone. His eyes curved into a smile, his previously cold and ruthless expression now softened into something unexpectedly cute... How should she put it? It was like a small, smooth, and bouncy little orca had just hatched from a prickly ice egg, gazing up at her and softly saying, "I want to fall in love with you, so whenever there’s an opportunity to make a movie, I’ll come."
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned by his directness.
 

 
Just a moment ago, Jiang Dang had been so talkative while rehearsing his lines, but now, on the phone screen, he was silent. After revealing his true intentions, he stared at her intently, the silence radiating an almost overwhelming weight.
 

 
This was definitely the type who didn’t give you any idea of what he might do next...
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily dazed, her mind in turmoil.
 

 
Duan Ge: "Looks like you didn't beat him hard enough last time."
 

 
Xuyi: "Maybe you beat him too hard, and it won his heart."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Interesting, I like him. He's a little better than Wei Zekai."
 

 
Not realizing it and waiting for the girl to chase after him? That’s a bit wishful thinking.
 

 
Consort Chen added his name to her little black book, eagerly awaiting his reaction once he finally understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned.
 

 
Was she falling for him?
 

 
Her mind was in chaos, but she tried to push aside the flood of thoughts and confirm with him: "Do you like me?"
 

 
She almost wanted to say that it wasn’t professional to want to work with her just for this reason.
 

 
But then she thought about it...
 

 
His main job was as a singer; film acting was just a hobby for him. However, it turned out that his acting had been surprisingly well-received by the audience, which was why he sometimes took on roles.
 

 
One important point was that collaborating with a star you genuinely like for a romantic film was actually quite professional in the era of instinctive films. In the entertainment industry, fast-paced love stories were the mainstream. The combination of a real romance and a heartfelt movie often ended with the couple's feelings deteriorating after the shoot, as they got busy with their own schedules and chose to break up…
 

 
That was the norm in the industry.
 

 
"Yeah, I really like you."
 

 
As he said this, Jiang Dang’s lips curved into a cheerful smile.
 

 
With his stunning, almost supernatural looks, he gave off the appearance of a well-behaved and obedient child, like an innocent and gentle trap:
 

 
"After we finished our last movie, I became your fan. Do you want to be a fan of me?"
 

 
...
 

 
Consort Chen: "Fan?!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Be a person, Your Majesty!"
 

 
Tong Zhao calmed herself and replied, "I’ll consider it. I’ll send you the script first. The male lead really suits you, but using you carries a bit of risk. As for the decision, I’ll let you know once the casting results are out."
 

 
"I was just joking about being a fan," Jiang Dang said.
 

 
"I know..."
 

 
"But I really like you."
 

 
?
 

 
If Jiang Dang played FPS games, he’d probably be a great sniper.
 

 
It was too direct.
 

 
Only someone with his straightforward personality would do something like this.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was thinking about how to reject him, Jiang Dang quickly added, "You don’t need to give me an answer right now. I just wanted to express how I feel. I still want to make a movie with you, and that’s all. Nothing else."
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao politely chatted for a few more minutes, and the video call ended without any persistence or clinginess.
 

 
Jiang Dang's demeanor was like a poet encountering the sunset, composing a poem to praise the magnificent scenery that moved his soul. But is it necessary to pluck a cloud from the sky and keep it? Having seen it, liked it, and expressed it—what more is there to do?
 

 
A thousand words can only turn into a sigh...
 

 
Indeed, he was a very special person!
 

 
The casting process moved quickly. After learning that the male lead in this movie, who would act alongside Tong Zhao, had a solid character profile, nearly everyone was eager to land the role. Even though the official casting hadn’t started yet, there were already countless people trying to gather information from her and Shi Qianqiu. Xu Yiming, in particular, was tempted more than ever. Hoping for a breakthrough with this unexpected opportunity, he wasn’t about to make any promises just for short-term gain.
 

 
When the public casting began, Shi Qianqiu shared an idea with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "You know, a lot of popular and reliable young actors are hesitant to work with you because you steal the spotlight too easily."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I know."
 

 
Was Shi Qianqiu deliberately trying to provoke her?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "It’s normal for love to have a power dynamic, but ‘Neverland Girl’ shouldn’t be a film where the female character completely overshadows the male. So, I have an idea…"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Can Han Zhi act?"
# Chapter104
Tong Zhao fell into a brief moment of speechlessness.
 

 
In her previous life, after suffering blows and targeted attacks, she became self-destructive and never entered the entertainment industry...
 

 
Thinking about it now, it was such a huge loss!
 

 
No wonder they are at the top of the pyramid; each one of them has a unique style and knows how to stir things up. Tong Zhao admired them, and a smile curved at the corners of her lips. She wasn't in a hurry to reply because, after all, she needed to ask Han Zhi's opinion.
 

 
Han Zhi: [I have no opinion.]
 

 
No personality would turn down anything that could help "Tong Zhao" rise to the next level.
 

 
After experiencing quick transmigration, this spirit of striving for progress had almost been etched into her soul. She wouldn’t suddenly feel discouraged or choose to give up in any world. Instead, she turned every task into a benefit, using this diverse life experience to improve herself.
 

 
[Actually, it’s quite good,]
 

 
Han Zhi thought about his fans in this world.
 

 
A ship can only have one captain. He knew he had to control his exposure and not feed his fans’ appetites too much, or it might have a negative impact on Tong Zhao herself. He and Tong Zhao were one entity—when Tong Zhao became famous, it also satisfied his own desire for fame. The only thing left was his concern for the fans.
 

 
Although Han Zhi didn’t deliberately guide them, many fans still saw him as a potential romantic partner and confessed their love to him in the live stream.
 

 
Perhaps because he wasn’t real, they didn’t fear it collapsing.
 

 
So their love was especially sincere and comforting.
 

 
Tearing rankings?
 

 
It was meaningless.
 

 
Boosting endorsement sales?
 

 
Buy what you can afford, but within reason. If any negative consequences came out of it, the company might decide to stop letting Brother Zhi stream, which would be bad.
 

 
Occasionally, someone would mention on Weibo that Han Zhi’s girlfriend fans were a breath of fresh air in the fan circle, with a heart full of one simple wish—just wanting to see their idol more.
 

 
Han Zhi felt that this had nothing to do with being a “breath of fresh air.”
 

 
In fact, the true intentions of all fangirls were not as brainless and dirty as the outside world imagined. They were simply led astray by various factors, with countless capital forces trying to make them go crazy… His girlfriend fans were indeed a “breath of fresh air,” only because his conditions were special, stripping away the superficial glamour and returning to the original essence of fanhood.
 

 
They just wanted to see him more.
 

 
And he did, too.
 

 
[I want to act.]
 

 
Han Zhi spoke.
 

 
Tong Zhao completely understood his thoughts.
 

 
Meanwhile, Shi Qianqiu was still explaining to her why he had such an explosive idea.
 

 
He had carefully watched the romantic variety show ‘Sea King Kill’ and had a high opinion of Han Zhi: “I didn’t mention similar thoughts before because he’s not suited for my kind of movie. My films focus on big-budget special effects and grand scenes, and his charm point is different from yours. He’s not really suited for such large-scale scenes…”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu further clarified that he wasn’t belittling Han Zhi.
 

 
To put it simply, when it comes to big-budget special effects and grand scenes, Tong Zhao is able to handle them well. She can charge forward with the wind, driving the audience’s emotions and getting them excited for the story’s climax.
 

 
Han Zhi is a different type. He is like a gentle, melancholic vortex—no matter how raging the flood is, he remains like a trap independent from the chaos, making people unconsciously ignore the grand scenes and focus on him, concerned about his emotions.
 

 
Looking at it from another perspective…
 

 
Isn’t this exactly the kind of talent needed for a romance film?
 

 
If the director uses him, there’s no need to worry about the audience not getting into the story.
 

 
It’s not a problem at all.
 

 
The more Shi Qianqiu thought about it, the more he felt that this was exactly the case.
 

 
He almost couldn’t wait to pull Tong Zhao over and push her into the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
The only drawback was that it might reinforce the stereotype that "Tong Zhao can’t work with other male stars"…
 

 
Shi Qianqiu honestly shared this concern with Tong Zhao, leaving her to decide for herself.
 

 
Without hesitation, Tong Zhao replied: “Then let’s book Han Zhi.”
 

 
Let the next movie solve the stereotype left by this one!
 

 
Seeing how quickly she made her decision, Shi Qianqiu no longer lingered on the downside. He eagerly started thinking about the benefits of using Han Zhi. At the very least, the publicity would be easy, as the topic was already hot. The only problem would be the roadshow, but they could try shifting the focus to variety shows and having him appear as a guest.
 

 
The benefits of controlling Han Zhi's exposure had already shown themselves.
 

 
At least his fans and netizens hadn’t grown tired of him yet. The company hadn’t seized this opportunity to over-saturate the market and exploit his popularity.
 

 
Those who stick to their principles end up with the best results in the end.
 

 
...
 

 
The news that Tong Zhao would be filming a new movie quickly spread.
 

 
At first, the industry buzzed with curiosity about the script she had chosen.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had turned down many good script offers recently. She was clearly aiming for something even better. What kind of amazing script could stand out and attract the attention of the box-office queen? This wasn’t a secret; Xu Yiming was building a team under Tong Zhao’s name. Of course, he wouldn’t easily show them the full script, but keeping it under wraps was hard…
 

 
After all, setting up a venue requires renting codes.
 

 
In just two days, the industry knew that Tong Zhao was filming a romance movie set in a luxurious mansion estate.
 

 
However, many people thought that the "romance film" was just a smokescreen.
 

 
They had their reasons, explained with confidence and backed by logic: "Can a romance brain really move Tong Zhao? Don’t think so, it’s definitely a mansion mystery murder case!"
 

 
"If you ask me, it should be a battle for a wealthy family’s inheritance."
 

 
"The possibility of suspense is very high. I think she’s played too many positive roles. Maybe she wants to try a more sinister protagonist. How about a serial killer who kidnaps victims and brings them to a mansion? I want to see her play a sexy Black Widow-style character." This was the opinion of a film critic who was obsessed with imperial assassins, hoping to see Tong Zhao once again play a ruthless character who kills as easily as slicing through vegetables.
 

 
Their analysis was thorough.
 

 
But no matter how reasonable their analysis was, it didn’t matter. Fans and critics were different—fans just wanted to indulge in sweet moments and see more beautiful looks.
 

 
In short, they wanted some sweetness and a beautiful big sister.
 

 
Such simple and unpretentious demands led to a flurry of half-true and half-false rumors and discussions on anonymous entertainment forums:
 

 
"I heard that TZ turned down three scripts this month. What role is she playing in her next movie?"
 

 
"Inside info: TZ’s next movie will reunite her with a certain villain."
 

 
"Groundhog scream! I haven’t seen my steamed bun in a while, where has she gone? Wuwuwu."
 

 
"Stop the waves, TZ’s retiring and getting married."
 

 
...
 

 
The increasing level of absurdity in the rumors showed just how desperate netizens were for information about Tong Zhao’s current status. Fans and insiders were especially sensitive. After all, Tong Zhao had always been known for her career-driven image. She usually didn’t stay idle, with variety shows often filling the gaps between movies. But after ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ wrapped up, she had only shown up at the celebration party and had otherwise seemed to disappear.
 

 
The all-powerful paparazzi couldn’t catch a glimpse of her.
 

 
Celebrities who had worked with her were asked about her and became more relaxed with their words: "Tong Zhao? She went out for a walk during the roadshow, couldn’t find her on the street, so save time and do something meaningful."
 

 
Thanks to the efforts of her team, netizens subconsciously received a message:
 

 
Tong Zhao was reducing her exposure, which meant she was starting to raise her profile.
 

 
Capital seeks profit, and as long as Tong Zhao could still carry box office numbers, she remained the darling of investors. But it was clear that Tong Zhao had higher ambitions and wasn’t satisfied with her current position. While her peers were still fighting for exposure and traffic, she had already moved to a different level. Industry insiders said that Shi Dingjun was planning to push for awards for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, and the lead actor might win their first major award since debut...
 

 
It was subtle, but it hinted that Tong Zhao’s team had begun to pursue awards.
 

 
Fans were both happy and disappointed.
 

 
Happy that their sister’s career was moving to the next level.
 

 
Disappointed that they still wanted to see more of Tong Zhao’s work.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao would occasionally livestream to play games, but under the company’s suggestion, her livestreams were indefinitely suspended. The result was that the best opportunity to see Tong Zhao was now in "Han Zhi’s" weekly two-hour holographic livestream. However, in order to create a sense of detachment from reality, Han Zhi rarely mentioned Tong Zhao. When asked in the live comments, he generally wouldn’t respond, and when he did, his answers were mostly distant, like "I’m not sure.”
 

 
How could it not be clear if it’s the same person?
 

 
So, whenever a fan of Tong Zhao carelessly asked similar questions, veteran viewers would explain the rules of the livestream.
 

 
Twenty minutes before the broadcast started today, a typical Tong Zhao fan, someone who had been following her for a long time, barged in.
 

 
[Stop asking, if you want to know Tong Zhao’s schedule, better ask Sister Chu.]
 

 
[Just focus on watching Brother Zhi, okay?]
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan quickly realized and politely apologized to their fellow fans.
 

 
The veteran viewers, understanding that Tong Zhao had been reducing her appearances lately and that her fans were eager for information, didn’t scold the fan.
 

 
Then, they waited. Finally, Han Zhi appeared.
 

 
The livestream screen lit up, revealing a luxurious apartment with minimalist decor (as Tong Zhao’s value increased, the company provided her with more upscale holographic livestream codes, indirectly giving Han Zhi’s fans a sense of "the idol is alive and growing"), and a fully outfitted man entered.
 

 
It was winter in reality, so everyone outside was bundled up, and Han Zhi was no exception.
 

 
He wore a black hat and mask, only revealing a pair of deep, melancholic eyes and a beautifully sculpted nose.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly removed his hat, turned his head, and his ears were flushed red.
 

 
When he took off his mask, his nose, slightly reddened from the cold, took a little bit away from his perfect image but instead made him appear more down-to-earth and approachable. The comment section was full of welcoming messages like "Welcome home, Brother," and some even called him "husband." If you didn’t know better, you’d think Han Zhi had a whole room of wives.
 

 
According to the system settings, the comments would appear in Han Zhi's line of sight as a projection, making it easy for him to see them at any time.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at the comments and, unable to suppress a warm smile, said:
 

 
"Yeah, I’m back."
 

 
[Ahhh, Brother, I missed you so much, can you stream a bit longer today?]
 

 
[Just now, a fan of Sister Zhao came in, but we didn’t scold him, we kindly explained the rules of the livestream!]
 

 
There were even some fans who wanted credit.
 

 
After removing his full disguise, Han Zhi sat down on the sofa in front of the camera, his face showing an indescribable fatigue, as if he had been on a long journey to some faraway place that fans didn’t know about, looking dusty and weary.
 

 
Where had he been?
 

 
No one knew, and that mystery was captivating.
 

 
The handsome young man visibly looked a bit tired, but his gaze remained focused as he read every line of the comments, then slowly and clearly praised them: "Well done, while I wasn’t here, you all behaved very well."
 

 
The comment section exploded with exclamations of joy, as if their hearts were hit by a wave of warmth.
 

 
The Tong Zhao fan who had stayed was a straight guy, indifferent to Han Zhi, and had been informed by other fans that Brother Zhi wouldn’t respond to any questions about Tong Zhao. He was about to leave when he saw Han Zhi call out his name: "She’s preparing for new work recently. I’ve been busy too, looks like I’m a bit tired, huh? But I’m still happy to see you all."
 

 
Many guys, after a whole day of work, will casually say "baby, I love you" to their girlfriends, just wanting to go to bed as soon as possible.
 

 
It’s true they’re tired and want to sleep, but the sincerity of "I love you" matters. The girlfriend can feel it… Saying "I love you" just to avoid being bothered by her is more hurtful than saying nothing at all. A woman might wonder when love words turned into a tool to make her stop bothering him, rather than coming from the heart?
 

 
But Han Zhi had the ability to make tens of thousands of girls believe that what he said was true.
 

 
They believed he was genuinely busy, and when he saw them, he was really happy.
 

 
Many girls in Han Zhi’s fanbase are not conventionally attractive. During his peak popularity, malicious comments were saying that girls who follow idols are generally unattractive and unloved, and those who follow virtual idols are even worse—like the upgraded version of the tank. These words are filled with stereotypes, and individuals in any fanbase indeed vary in appearance, and beauty should not be defined by weight.
 

 
However, hearing such things still hurts.
 

 
In Han Zhi’s livestream, he doesn’t say exaggerated, hollow words. Instead, in the small, subtle interactions, you can feel his love and gentleness toward every fan…
 

 
He’s not in a rush to prove anything; both the fans and he can take their time.
 

 
Confidence is built slowly.
 

 
Fans who are loved by him can't be swayed by the malicious slanders of trolls.
 

 
– “Brother says I’m good and cute, but the trolls say I’m not, who are they to talk? Get lost, trolls!”
 

 
[What’s Brother up to?]
 

 
[I thought Brother was on vacation.]
 

 
“I’m not on vacation. The company gave me some work, so I might get busier soon.”
 

 
[Oh? Is Tong Zhao taking a new movie? Or a variety show? A TV drama?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans assumed that when Brother said he was getting busier, it meant Tong Zhao had new resources lined up.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s exhaustion would affect Han Zhi.
 

 
But this was purely the fans’ imagination. After her cultivation, Tong Zhao was so healthy she could fight ten people at once. Even when the entire production crew was exhausted, she was still full of energy. Her Brother Zhi might look tired, but that was just his personal style—a man who could always pull a pretty girl into his arms and fall asleep together.
 

 
“Can’t say.”
 

 
During the livestream, Han Zhi subtly dropped a big piece of news, and soon, the fact that Tong Zhao was considering taking a new film spread.
 

 
This was part of Tong Zhao’s team’s plan.
 

 
Fans didn’t expect the male lead to be Han Zhi, and assumed that it was simply about Tong Zhao taking a new project.
 

 
The news gradually started to spread in the industry…
 

 
It’s confirmed to be a romance movie!
 

 
So, who is the male lead?
 

 
Fans turned their attention to male stars who had recently cleared their schedules and had the right star power.
 

 
However, some fans who were more knowledgeable about the entertainment industry analyzed that Tong Zhao might cast a newcomer, as established male stars might be reluctant to work with her, fearing they’d be overshadowed by her. “Acting with Tong Zhao” might not be as appealing as they imagined.
 

 
In any case, the least credible rumor about her retiring and getting married was quickly debunked.
 

 
Manager Chu subtly mentioned on Weibo that it was a very traditional romance movie, with no monsters to fight, and that the male lead would be someone no one expected.
 

 
Someone with good intentions shared this with Jiang Dang.
 

 
He was quite disappointed: [Then I have no hope.]
 

 
Friends eating melon: [?]
 

 
Jiang Dang: [Netizens all think that I’m meant to be with Tong Zhao. Since the male lead is someone no one expects, then it definitely isn’t me.]
 

 
The friends and family were at a loss for words for a moment.
 

 
It can't be said to be completely fabricated, but rather, it was something made up out of thin air.
 

 
After analyzing it from every angle, they finally concluded that the male lead for Tong Zhao's project must be a new face that no one has seen before!
# Chapter105
The crew arrived so quickly, like a tornado.
 

 
The crew for ‘Neverland Girl’ quickly came together, and Xu Yiming thought he was dreaming—ever since the director was confirmed to be Shi Qianqiu, he had felt a bit helpless. His attitude toward the two towering figures was full of respect and fear. This was obviously not good for a producer. Fortunately, midway through, Shi Qianqiu deliberately gave him a lot of power, letting him handle things as long as they got done right. It was only then that Xu Yiming evolved from being a sycophant back into a human being.
 

 
Tong Zhao said she didn’t expect him to be so good at managing people.
 

 
Could it be that he had the face of a stepmother but the heart of a real mother?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “What kind of people can you hire with a 40 million budget? It’s still about finding the right foreman that fits the spending level.”
 

 
…
 

 
Sigh, she had overestimated him.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly changed his WeChat note to "Versailles Director."
 

 
So Versailles, yet so annoying.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “By the way, a group of people wants to come for the audition for the lead actress’s parents. Do you want to supervise?”
 

 
They were from the same city.
 

 
But they were both so busy, their schedules never aligned, so they had never had a chance to hang out.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how her career had been smooth sailing since her rebirth, and she hadn’t experienced many auditions. She had only tried out for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ twice and hadn’t seen anyone else audition. Since she was considering upgrading from a piece on the chessboard to the player, understanding the filmmaking process was essential. After confirming the audition date, she squeezed out time from her schedule: “I can come.”
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
Once it was decided, Shi Qianqiu promptly hung up the phone.
 

 
…
 

 
The audition was set for 2:00 PM.
 

 
To save costs, the audition would take place in a relatively simple setting, and the scene would be very short, aiming to assess the actor's compatibility with the role in the briefest possible segment. Tong Zhao had a spa session in the morning, arriving 15 minutes early at the audition location in the afternoon.
 

 
The heating in the minivan was set high, and after walking through the cold air of the parking lot, she entered the warm movie studio building. The alternating hot and cold air made her eyes feel dry, and she regretted not wearing sunglasses.
 

 
She found the audition room and opened the door, just in time to see Shi Qianqiu giving instructions.
 

 
“Xiao Zhao!”
 

 
A worker recognized Tong Zhao and enthusiastically greeted her.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu heard the voice and turned around. As their gazes met, Tong Zhao saw a look of surprise on his gentle, scholarly face. He walked over, looking at her curiously: "Who made you cry?"
 

 
"How can you tell I cried?"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu motioned for her to look at the mirror hanging nearby, meant for actors to check their makeup.
 

 
The round mirror reflected her moist, reddened eyes, as if there were traces of tears.
 

 
"Cold and hot air, it irritated my eyes," Tong Zhao explained nonchalantly. "Is everyone here?"
 

 
"They're here. We're just testing the equipment. Do you want to look at the script?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
Because the cost of renting the luxurious mansion for the actual film was too expensive, the audition’s budget would exceed, so Xu Yiming rented another residential location code for the audition background. This savvy cost-saving move impressed Shi Qianqiu, who jokingly referred to him as the "King of Thrift" in their WeChat group.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: Is this considered bullying on the set?
 

 
However, Xu Yiming was thrilled to be praised by his idol and quickly changed his group nickname to "King of Thrift Xu Yiming."
 

 
... The thoughts of a sycophant—humans just don’t understand.
 

 
Now, back to the present.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the paper script.
 

 
The story in the script takes place in a plain, ordinary apartment, with three characters: an elderly couple and their daughter, who returns to her parents’ home after suffering from domestic violence.
 

 
The script was only two thin pages, with few lines, but the scenes were full of tension, and the opening was a conflict.
 

 
Audition Script
 

 
Time: 6:00 PM
 
Location: Apartment #01341, Residential Type
 
Characters:
 
- Father Nie
 
- Mother Nie
 
- Nie Siyan
 

 
Mother Nie is cooking dinner while Father Nie sits at the dining table reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings, and Mother Nie quickly puts down the ladle and rushes to open the door. She finds her daughter, who has returned from her marriage. Her daughter looks exhausted, wearing a thick scarf that doesn't match the current season's temperature (to hide the bruises on her neck).
 

 
Mother Nie asks her why she's home so late and where Lu Junsheng is.
 

 
Nie Siyan awkwardly says that she missed home.
 

 
The beef brisket with potatoes has just finished simmering, and Mother Nie invites her daughter to sit down and eat while they ask about her life. After a brief moment of restraint, Nie Siyan confesses the truth of the domestic violence she has been enduring.
 

 
At first, her parents don't believe her until she shows them evidence of the bruises.
 

 
---
 

 
The audition script for ‘Neverland Girl’ is structured to set the scene, observing how actors instinctively choose their responses, which the director and crew then assess for suitability. The team behind ‘Neverland Girl’ is relatively simple, primarily made up of Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao.
 

 
More than twenty people are waiting for auditions, with the queue ordered by fame and price. Once a satisfactory candidate is found, the remaining auditioners don’t need to proceed, keeping costs at a minimum. This is Tong Zhao's first time seeing such an organized audition process, and she's a bit excited.
 

 
The fact that Tong Zhao is supervising the audition is kept a secret from the auditioners—this is a confidential trip.
 

 
The staff is busy, and a helper gently asks if Sister Xiao needs anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao shakes her head.
 

 
Just before the auditions begin, Shi Qianqiu mysteriously brings over a large cup of honey water and snacks.
 

 
Chips, popcorn, milk candy, sweet potato fries—both salty and sweet options are available.
 

 
Like many people, when she's not truly hungry or thirsty, Tong Zhao wouldn't usually bother asking for food. But when it's brought to her, it’s a different story. She accepts the warm honey water and a basket of sweet potato fries, and when she sees a large tub of popcorn, she can't help but laugh: "Are you watching a movie or having a snack?"
 

 
"You're not wrong," Shi Qianqiu replies as he sits beside her. The large screen in the audition room lights up.
 

 
Unlike typical holographic filming setups, the screen for each auditionee shows their name and number above their head, which gives off a bit of a video game character vibe. The first pair to audition are Chen Feilan and Su Qihua, two regulars who often play supporting roles in family dramas. They're known for their strong, dominant on-screen personalities, and they're featured in more than half of the family-oriented, frustrating dramas in the market.
 

 
Their collaboration in family dramas is often so realistic that audiences will jokingly wonder, "When did they install cameras in my hometown?" They usually don’t need a pre-written script to deliver down-to-earth performances, like forcing someone to attend a blind date or using tricks to get them married—it’s all second nature to them.
 

 
Replacing Tong Zhao in the role of the daughter is a temporary actress with a more docile subconscious.
 

 
The purpose of the audition is to see how well the actors fit the role, allowing them to perform freely. Tong Zhao had considered stepping in herself, but Shi Qianqiu stopped her. He said he didn’t want to risk an unexpected mishap, and that if things didn’t go smoothly, they would have to shoot multiple takes. He had prepared two temporary actresses, so there was no need to put her through that.
 

 
The first audition begins.
 

 
Chen Feilan is cooking, while Su Qihua is reading the newspaper. The doorbell rings…
 

 
The opening scene is no problem.
 

 
"Why are you back at this hour? Where’s Junsheng?"
 

 
"He... he’s busy. I don’t know about him, I just missed you, missed home."
 

 
"Come on in, if you miss home, you should come back and have a meal with Junsheng. Mom doesn't mind cooking for one more person."
 

 
A pot of beef brisket with potatoes is placed in the center of the dining table.
 

 
Chen Feilan continued to express her concern, one sentence after another, her words thick with maternal love and worry, each sentence pressing her daughter’s head lower and lower, until she couldn't lift it anymore.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was making notes on his iPad.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at the screen: [Satisfying the suppression disguised as love.]
 

 
The daughter nervously explained why she had returned so suddenly, and then, with a hint of crying in her voice, continued: "Mom, he hits me every day, I can't live like this anymore..."
 

 
"He hits you? How is that possible?"
 

 
In the script's setup, the son-in-law is a clean-cut, handsome white-collar worker. He doesn’t look at all like the type of person they imagined would be capable of beating his wife.
 

 
Faced with her parents' disbelief, the daughter had no choice but to roll up her sleeves to prove it.
 

 
This is where the plot takes a turn.
 

 
Su Qihua frowned, accusing his daughter of surely doing something wrong to anger the son-in-law: "You keep running back to your parents’ house to seek justice; all that does is drive a wedge between the couple. So now you’ve just come back here, what do you think your in-laws will say about you?" Chen Feilan covered her face and cried, feeling sorry for her daughter’s misfortune. She stopped her husband from saying more: "Wait, I'll go with you to apologize and buy some gifts to talk things over with your in-laws."
 

 
After a long lecture, the daughter remained silent, her eyes filled with despair.
 

 
Chen Feilan pulled her sleeve back to cover the bruises on her arms, worried about what the neighbors would say if they saw.
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao furrowed her brow: "They are more suited for TV dramas."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu agreed: "They can't capture that feeling of indulgence."
 

 
The two exchanged their thoughts on the characters quietly.
 

 
"The parents' original intention of sheltering their daughter was to protect her, afraid she might end up like the older daughter, who died unexpectedly. Even though their love may have unintentionally turned into overprotection, the focus should be on their excessive care for the daughter. Their subconscious can indeed bring out strong conflict in a short amount of time, but it's not the effect I'm looking for," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"Yes, I also want this film to be more romantic and beautiful, not a family drama with trivial matters," Shi Qianqiu agreed.
 

 
"However, with their performance, the part where the daughter argues with her parents for her personal autonomy will definitely be very interesting," he added.
 

 
"Let's see how others perform."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
The second pair of auditionees wanted to take the daughter to the police but hesitated when the daughter blocked them. The family sat together, their faces full of sorrow and tension, staring at the beef brisket with potatoes.
 

 
The third pair, even after seeing the daughter’s injuries, still refused to believe she had been abused. They preferred to believe in their good memories of the son-in-law. He was such a gentle scholar; how could he possibly hit a woman?
 

 
After watching these three pairs, Tong Zhao's eyes were opened.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was patient, showing no sign of impatience. As usual, he asked the staff about the auditionees' details. Since the auditions were ordered by fame, by the fourth pair, the names started to become unfamiliar—names Tong Zhao had never seen before.
 

 
When the screen lit up again, both of them straightened up, ready to observe.
 

 
The previous scene had smoothly progressed with the daughter revealing the cruel treatment she suffered at her in-laws' home.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu said, "I already know the next line — 'Really? How could that be? Did he just push you, and you overreacted?'"
 

 
Tong Zhao placed a handful of chips on his bucket of popcorn: "Food can't shut your mouth."
 

 
The monitoring screen showed the parents' faces turning pale.
 

 
The actress playing the mother trembled as she gently stroked her daughter's bruises, silent tears flowing down her face as she embraced her, patting her back to comfort her. The actress playing the daughter had already entered the same scene four times, numb and unaware, her sadness and pain frozen into a mask on her face.
 

 
And this mask shattered and melted in the mother's embrace.
 

 
"Nan Nan, don’t go back. Stay here with us, okay?"
 

 
"But..."
 

 
When the parents proactively suggested not returning to that house, the daughter hesitated. The mother then gently coaxed her, using a half-persuading, half-soothing tone. The daughter looked towards her father, who nodded, "Listen to your mother."
 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu didn't stop them early, allowing the three of them to continue for a little while. He then guided the daughter to ask specific questions: "If I divorce Junsheng, I won't have anywhere to live..."
 

 
"How could you not have anywhere to live? You can stay at home, sleep with mom. You used to sleep between us when you were little."
 

 
"I'm older now. It's hard to find a partner for a second marriage."
 

 
The mother embraced her from behind: "If you don't marry, you'll live with me for the rest of your life."
 

 
---
 

 
When the two extra actors stepped out of the holographic filming booth, Shi Qianqiu's assistant approached to inform them that they had been selected to play the parents of the female lead. They were overjoyed.
 

 
The older generation, having grown up in the traditional film era, generally resisted instinct-based films, always thinking that such high-tech equipment must be highly radioactive. So, aside from regular supporting actors, most people auditioning at the film studio were those who were struggling financially and seeking extra work.
 

 
These two extra actors were no exception.
 

 
Zhang Siliang, chosen to play the mother of the female lead, was a single mother, waiting to use her pay to help support her married son. She beamed with happiness and thanked the assistant repeatedly.
 

 
"Why are you thanking me? It was Director Shi's decision," the assistant laughed, seeing the two extras look both thrilled and nervous, afraid they might not perform well in such an important role. The assistant comforted them, "Don’t worry, not only is Director Shi here today, but Xiao Zhao is here too. Both of them think you’re perfect for the role, so just relax and wait for the shoot!"
 

 
Meanwhile, the other auditionees had already moved on to their next auditions, with only the first pair still waiting for notification.
 

 
Chen Feilan and Su Qihua had observed the other contestants before their audition and felt confident they would secure the role, but instead, they waited and waited, only to lose out unexpectedly.
 

 
"How unlucky," Chen Feilan muttered. "Didn't you say you were close to Director Shi?"
 

 
Su Qihua, caught off guard, felt a little guilty. His relationship with Shi Qianqiu was limited to occasionally running into him at the local film studio. He explained, "Didn't you hear? The lead actress is here today too. If she doesn’t like us, what can Director Shi do?"
 

 
"Really lacking vision."
 

 
Chen Feilan took his words seriously, and her opinion of Tong Zhao dropped.
 

 
The strict, controlling parents—he thought they had played better roles than this. Were they really rejecting them just because they were too expensive? Chen Feilan really wanted to indulge her passion for acting in a film, so she placed the blame on Tong Zhao...
 

 
On the other side, after accompanying the other roles through their auditions, Tong Zhao was called over by Shi Qianqiu: "Do you have any plans next?"
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
"I'm hungry. How about we grab a meal on the way? You said you’d treat me last time, but we never had the chance."
 

 
The "last time" referred to when they were filming ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Tong Zhao's schedule for the evening was indeed free, and the experience of watching the audition together had been light and enjoyable. After a brief thought, she agreed, telling her assistant not to worry about giving her a ride back, as she would just take Shi Qianqiu's car.
 

 
The assistant obediently left in the shuttle car to finish their day early.
 

 
Five minutes later, Tong Zhao stood beside Shi Qianqiu's fluorescent green sports car, suddenly feeling the urge to call the driver to bring the shuttle car back.
# Chapter106
“If you don’t like this one, there are others.”
 

 
There are two types of parking spaces in the film studio.
 

 
One is the public parking space.
 

 
Although it’s called public, it’s actually only open to guests with reservations. So, actors or extras who don’t have contracts or weren’t invited by the studio can only take public transportation or park in nearby lots and walk to the studio.
 

 
The other type is private parking spaces, usually bought by major entertainment companies for their own artists when they come to shoot films or TV shows.
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu led Tong Zhao to another understated black Bentley. Seeing Tong Zhao clearly relax, he smiled lightly with his thin lips: “All the cars at home are black. I’ve gotten a little tired of them, so when I bought a car, I wanted something more colorful.”
 

 
Fluorescent green is too colorful.
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly recalled that Shi Qianqiu’s family seemed to be involved in some gray industries. Then, thinking about "All the cars at home are black"… Ah, so this is the image of an underworld heir that comes to mind. Shi Qianqiu opened the car door for her, and after seeing her expression, even though she hadn’t spoken, he smoothly caught her train of thought: “Yes, I’m the heir of the Shi family who has been wandering outside. Last time I went home, the two rows of cars filled up the entire street, and two lines of men in black suits bowed to welcome the return of the Shura heir.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
After getting into the car, Tong Zhao rolled her eyes at him without any lady-like restraint: “I just thought that your taste in cars should have a lot in common with my childhood friend.”
 

 
To her surprise, Shi Qianqiu even mentioned a familiar name: “Wei Zekai?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t expect him to guess so accurately and was slightly surprised.
 

 
“He’s very simple.”
 

 
“You’re so protective of him, so is the gossip true?” Shi Qianqiu smirked and sat in the driver’s seat.
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled up her mask, trying to hide her small face behind it.
 

 
“That tone of yours... I think I’ve seen it somewhere before.”
 

 
As he spoke, Shi Qianqiu shook his smartwatch, making a few quick adjustments. He then selected the scene he wanted from the massive film library. The small smartwatch was incredibly powerful, directly connecting to the car's sound system. Soon, a dramatic, melodramatic audio clip began to play, with immersive surround sound:
 

 
[Tell me, who is that woman to you?]
 

 
The plain-dressed wife clutched her husband, who was about to leave, and tearfully asked.
 

 
“I don’t even know who you’re talking about.”
 

 
“Don’t lie to me,” the wife sneered, “That new assistant at your company, Mary, just graduated from college, right? She’s so young but already knows how to seduce other people's husbands. How could you do that?”
 

 
Hearing the name Mary, the husband frowned and pulled her hand away: "I don't know what you're talking about. Don't go crazy just because you heard there's a new female classmate at my company."
 

 
"Well, if you're not going to admit it, I even have her phone number and address. Do you want me to take the records of your hotel stays and chats and ask her family about it?"
 

 
When the wife mentioned confronting the mistress, the husband finally couldn't hold it in any longer and his face changed. He shouted at her: "You're crazy! She's not like you, she's very innocent. I need to protect her. Listen, what happens behind closed doors is our business. Do you want to make it so everyone loses face? Is that what will make you happy?!"
 

 
This was a real shout.
 

 
Tong Zhao could only regret that the mask she pulled up couldn't cover her ears.
 

 
"You really find the clips fast. Is it true that if there's a number, you can find any resources?"
 

 
Tong Zhao made a sarcastic remark.
 

 
"Apologies,"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shook his wrist again, and the picture and sound disappeared simultaneously. "It's a professional habit. When I'm not filming, I absorb a lot of information. I’ve watched almost every instinctive movie on the market, including some bad ones. Sometimes, I think they’re bad, but in a creative way."
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything.
 

 
Although she didn’t speak, Shi Qianqiu continued, almost as if reading her mind: "I used to use this trick often when I was dating. No matter the scene, I could pull out the perfect classic romantic lines for the mood... I'm a screenwriter and director, right? So, let the movie speak my romantic lines for me."
 

 
That was quite a move.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Learned something.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [You’re not right.]
 

 
"It is quite romantic," Tong Zhao acknowledged, but then became a little curious, "What happened next?"
 

 
"There was no ‘next.’ I'm not in a relationship right now," Shi Qianqiu's black Bentley quietly merged into the flow of traffic. In the rearview mirror, his faint smile reflected, but his eyes had a cold undertone: "I don't think you would be moved by this... If I were your boyfriend and I did this, what would your reaction be?"
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned her chin on her hand, staring out at the scenery passing by quickly, and absentmindedly responded:
 

 
"Me? I’d probably say, 'Don’t talk about work on a date, and if you love me, just say it to my face.'"
 

 
When she said the word "love," her expression softened. The light outside the window illuminated her bright almond-shaped eyes, creating a crescent-shaped glow. It was so beautiful that Shi Qianqiu, in the rearview mirror, couldn’t help but want to take a picture of her. He was eager to do so.
 

 
So, Shi Qianqiu’s thoughts shifted to the topic of filmmaking:
 

 
"By the way, how did you come to choose this script? The script itself is good, but there must be something particularly appealing to you about it."
 

 
Talking about work, Tong Zhao became more animated.
 

 
Although she didn’t know where they were going for dinner, and the drive seemed to be quite long, the two of them kept chatting nonstop about the topic of ‘Neverland Girl’. Before long, they had arrived at the place where Shi Qianqiu had planned to take her for dinner.
 

 
It was a quiet Japanese restaurant located in the middle of the hustle and bustle, operating on a reservation system. The two of them sat down in front of the sushi chef, and soon enough, they didn’t see any other diners—Tong Zhao guessed that they only took one group of customers per time slot.
 

 
This Japanese restaurant seemed to specialize in various types of alcohol. The wooden shelves were lined with a dazzling array of bottles, and even the wine glasses were quite refined. Each dish was paired with a different type of alcohol, served in small sips that didn’t leave a strong alcoholic aftertaste. As soon as Tong Zhao tasted it, she realized that the intention wasn’t to get her drunk.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and teased, “You’ve served me a lot to drink, but it’s not strong enough to get me drunk.”
 

 
“Why would you want to get drunk?” Shi Qianqiu refilled her glass, but only poured a small amount. “I’m not worried about the cost of the alcohol, but if someone gets drunk, how are they supposed to have a decent conversation?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu once again defied her impression of him.
 

 
At private gatherings, he wasn’t the carefree, artsy youth she had expected. Instead, he was capable of making in-depth discussions about the film industry, offering fresh and clear insights:
 

 
"My movies always do well at the box office. What's the secret to success? To put it simply, I know what the audience wants to see. The arrival of instinctive movies has changed the audience, and interestingly, the audience has adapted to the changes of the times faster than many filmmakers. While some directors are still stuck debating how to refine the script and control the plot, the story starts to become too conservative and boring… Isn’t it funny to try and make traditional movies with the techniques used to capture the subconscious?"
 

 
"You’re going to become a big hit, and one of the reasons is that your subconscious is perfectly suited for the kind of problem instinctive movies address."
 

 
"The variety of your subconscious is something I’ve never seen before in all my years as a director."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had a good tolerance for alcohol, but he still drank more than Tong Zhao.
 

 
With the effects of the alcohol, his gaze softened. His eyes narrowed into a gentle smile as he looked at Tong Zhao, and his tone suddenly became softer: "They say your subconscious is unstable and not suitable for instinctive films, but I don’t agree. And I’m a successful director, much more successful than those who say such things..."
 

 
He paused.
 

 
There was much more he wanted to say.
 

 
For example, the reason Shi Qianqiu wanted "Han Zhi" to play the male lead wasn’t just because he recognized that this aspect of her subconscious was indeed well-suited for the role, but also because he wanted to uncover more of the charming sides of Tong Zhao’s subconscious—why, just because her subconscious was different, did they say she wasn’t suitable? He didn’t believe it.
 

 
However, when these words were spoken, they felt a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Passersby and fans who didn’t know the truth might think this was a sweet conversation between a domineering director and his favored star.
 

 
But that wasn’t the case.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu just really wanted to work with the instinctive actor he had his eye on and slap all the naysayers in the face.
 

 
...
 

 
The dinner went very smoothly.
 

 
As the two of them took the elevator downstairs, Tong Zhao’s lips, hidden behind her mask, curved into a pleasant smile.
 

 
When the elevator doors opened, Tong Zhao was about to say something, but just as the words were on the tip of her tongue, the sound of a camera shutter interrupted her. Tong Zhao quickly turned her head, her almond-shaped eyes narrowing sharply as she focused on the source of the sound.
 

 
The paparazzi didn’t expect her to react so quickly.
 

 
But so what?
 

 
The target had seen the camera, and the entertainment reporters were thrilled to capture the shot. Tong Zhao made a quick decision in that instant—her gaze became indifferent as she turned away, walking toward Shi Qianqiu’s car. She didn’t care how the paparazzi got her whereabouts, as it was impossible to guard against everything, unless she locked herself inside her house 24/7...
 

 
#Tong Zhao Secretly Meets Director Shi#
 

 
#Tong Zhao’s Relationship Exposed#
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, nearly as soon as she got home, the trending topics followed right behind her. It seemed like the paparazzi couldn’t wait to sell the photos. Tong Zhao had already given Chu Jie a heads-up, and PR had decided not to buy the batch of photos. They just treated it as movie publicity. The gossip was easy to explain—movie collaboration, she went to the audition in the afternoon, then grabbed a bite afterward. What was so strange about that?
 

 
Seeing the overwhelming rumors, Tong Zhao sipped a cup of hot tea to calm her nerves and sober up.
 

 
This time, she was much more calm on WeChat.
 

 
It seemed her friends had learned to tell the difference between fake and real news—especially the partners from Zeshan Ventures, who were particularly unfazed. They watched Wei Zekai worry and, one by one, calmly continued chatting, with one person even posting "99" on the screen.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her phone to check and immediately laughed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Aren't you guys worried???]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The wild man is going to steal Tong Zhao!!!]
 

 
Second Generation A: [Give it up, if Sister Zhao wasn't single, she would definitely tell us.]
 

 
Second Generation B: [He’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out, he’s freaking out.]
 

 
Second Generation C: [No one would really be triggered by just a few photos, right? No way, right?]
 

 
No one understood Wei Zekai. He was frustrated.
 

 
Wei Zekai angrily sent an emoji of a punch:
 

 
[You don’t understand, Shi Qianqiu is no simple character. I’m worried that Tong Zhao is too naive and might get tricked.]
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao saw this message, she momentarily lost focus and thought about the melodramatic TV drama that Shi Qianqiu had played for her. The other partners from Zeshan Ventures weren’t swayed by his words. After all, no matter how you looked at it, it was only Sister Zhao who was playing someone else. She was too naive to get tricked? Uh...
 

 
It was probably only Wei Zekai who thought that way.
# Chapter107
This relationship is a bit twisted, really. Wei Zekai doesn't know Shi Qianqiu personally. What he knows is Shi Qianqiu's younger brother, Shi Wandong, who has always obediently followed the family's plan, shouldering the responsibility of inheriting the family business. For years, he has diligently managed the group, ensuring his older brother could lavishly spend his earnings in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai doesn’t have many friends, but it turns out he has one she didn’t know about.
 

 
The reason he doesn’t have many friends is that he has a sharp tongue and is picky about people. Additionally, the aura of the eldest son of the Wei family is always intimidating. However, once you become his friend, you’ll realize that behind this "intimidating" exterior, the truth is that he’s "easy to handle"...
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Wandong is a good person, just busy, so we never had the chance to hang out together.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I told him before, everyone thinks I’m unreliable, but only he and you think I’m good. Why do you think that is? He said that growing up with his older brother made him see everyone as more reliable than his brother. But Wandong is a bit of a "brother's boy"—he complains, but still works tirelessly. Every time Shi Qianqiu has a new film release, he always organizes employees to go watch it, paying for the tickets himself.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao listened to him, she began searching online.
 

 
What popped up about Shi Wandong was an elite figure who resembled Shi Qianqiu by about seventy to eighty percent. He wore a suit and gold-rimmed glasses, looking like a reliable good boy—though he looked a little older, he didn’t resemble Shi Qianqiu’s younger brother at all. In fact, he looked more like Shi Qianqiu’s older brother. Tong Zhao clicked through a couple more pages and even stumbled upon some fanfiction about the two of them in a "bone-crushing" (medical) couple pairing... What the heck! Tong Zhao, who couldn’t stomach the "real" couple pairing, quickly covered her face and exited the page, desperately clicking the "X" to protect her eyes.
 

 
Wei Zekai rambled on, providing examples of Shi Qianqiu being "no saint."
 

 
For instance, he once tricked his younger brother into doing his summer homework by claiming it was to "prepare for higher-level courses." For a whole year, Shi Wandong did all his homework for him, only to be caught by their mother, which finally put an end to it. This kind of brotherly betrayal actually managed to fool Shi Wandong into thinking it was a "warm" memory of his older brother being overly considerate about his studies.
 

 
For example, every time Shi Wandong brought a girl he liked home to study, the girl would inevitably fall in love with his older brother.
 

 
Since Shi Wandong admired his older brother so much, the stories created by his brother were naturally considered sacred. He ended up receiving the treatment of "asking his younger brother which character he liked, and then killing off that character" and "getting sabotaged during the climax."
 

 
Wei Zekai summarized:
 

 
[As an only child, half of my sense of happiness comes from Shi Wandong’s daily life.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [What about the other half?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [The distribution of assets in my father’s will.]
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao, being so honest, didn’t know how to respond and really wanted to immediately forward this to Uncle Wei.
 

 
Unknowingly, the bad mood she had been in, caused by those odd and frustrating people, faded away as she read through one new message after another. The corners of Tong Zhao's lips curved into a gentle smile: [Alright, I get it. Not in a relationship, but working, huh?]
 

 
The topic naturally shifted to her new movie.
 

 
Tong Zhao made a mental note of all of Shi Qianqiu’s black history.
 

 
But knowing this person’s thick skin, even if she brought it up in front of him, his most likely reaction would be to take pride in it rather than be ashamed.
 

 
Ah.
 

 
Back to their scandal.
 

 
The paparazzi they ran into that day had great photography skills, and the photos turned out beautifully. After post-production filters, they captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu looking relaxed and at ease during their casual conversation, as well as her alert gaze when she realized she was being photographed. Netizens commented that it was like a switch from Omega to Alpha in an instant. Some even fantasized about the "cold and guarded towards the world, but affectionate and gentle only to you" CP (couple) dynamic...
 

 
In public, Tong Zhao always exuded a star-like aura.
 

 
It wasn’t just about what she wore, but also her facial expressions and overall demeanor. She was so beautiful that it gave off a sense of distance, never disappointing her fans.
 

 
It was rare to see her in casual attire and with a more relaxed expression, which fans took as a sweet treat, excitedly calling her "Zhao Bao" (a nickname for her).
 

 
The fans, however, were fine.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always been very tolerant of the group of people who adore her, and she only controls them a little when they show signs of aggression. Other than that, she doesn't mind when they joke around or ship her with others. After all, even the purest of actors can't avoid the fan economy; it's just a matter of the extent of their influence. Who can really be harsh on those who genuinely adore them? At least she can't. That's why she has always treated her fans like half-clients.
 

 
As long as she can satisfy them, she does her best to do so, but overall, she follows the company's and her own preferences.
 

 
When she saw clueless passersby and gossiping marketing accounts stoking the fire, Tong Zhao became a little annoyed. After discussing it with her company, she decided not to respond or clarify on her own. Let people guess all they want. If this scandal lasts until the film's promotional period, it would probably be too late to debunk it, and it could even help generate some buzz.
 

 
If Shi Qianqiu wants to clarify things, Tong Zhao would cooperate.
 

 
What if he suddenly wants to date someone?
 

 
It wouldn't be a good influence.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't want to be foolish and ask him how he planned to handle their scandal.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known as the "Weibo King" of the director's circle, didn't post anything to clarify.
 

 
Fans kept gossiping in his comments, and after he blocked a group of them, there were still strange comments like: [I don't support you dating Tong Zhao. Such beautiful and high-quality genes should be passed on. Since Director Shi is childfree, he should let her go.] Some even posted image comments: [They are a perfect match, how dare you, this monster, oppose them? JPG]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t bother responding, fully showing his noble and cold demeanor.
 

 
As the public discourse became heated, Tong Zhao visibly became more low-key. It wasn't until the early preparation work for ‘Neverland Girl’ was complete and the film was ready to start shooting that she went to the film studio, escorted by her assistant and driver.
 

 
...
 

 
For the part of the female lead losing her sanity, in typical instinct-driven films, the effect is often achieved by blocking part of the actor's memory backstage.
 

 
But the result is often mediocre.
 

 
It’s similar to the performances of inexperienced actors.
 

 
Even when they have amnesia, you can still tell they are acting with the mindset and demeanor of an adult.
 

 
Since this was a self-invested film, Tong Zhao boldly proposed a segmented filming approach, just like for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’. The amnesia part would be played by Zhao Zai, and the parts before amnesia and after the memory recovery, where the character becomes stronger, would be played by herself.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu unconditionally supported her innovative proposal.
 

 
With the director's support, the matter was settled.
 

 
The female lead of ‘Neverland Girl’ was originally depicted as soft and dreamy, just like when she embarked on her journey into the world of "quick transmigration" (a type of genre where the protagonist travels between different worlds). She was well protected by her family, never suspecting that the evil wolf was right beside her or that her seemingly perfect best friend was secretly jealous of her to the point of madness…
 

 
The script's early stages were tightly controlled, and even though Tong Zhao's subconscious was stronger and more independent than the character's setup, she wouldn't stray too far from the role.
 

 
All the actors lay in the holographic filming chambers, connected to the equipment.
 

 
The large screen on the control desk displayed the connection status of all the devices and whether the corresponding props' codes were in place.
 

 
The most unique aspect was that only one device was shown for the lead role.
 

 
This device was connected to two modules, with one brain supporting the performances of two characters. The medical team’s gaze at Shi Qianqiu was filled with reproach, while their gaze at Tong Zhao, earlier, had been as if looking at a madwoman.
 

 
A madwoman who was willing to be cruel to herself in pursuit of the perfect ideal she had in mind.
 

 
“Neverland Girl, Action!”
 

 
...
 

 
The first thing that came into view was a luxurious mansion.
 

 
Tong Zhao received a share of the profits. The mansion, rented and then painstakingly remodeled by a template designer over half a month, represented a significant portion of the film's budget. Everywhere you looked, there were carefully arranged flowers and plants, creating a dreamy paradise that every young girl had once fantasized about. The color scheme was a harmonious blend of soft pastel pinks, blues, and yellows, resembling the style of a Disney theme park.
 

 
It was indeed a bit extravagant.
 

 
But it was the choice made after discussions between Shi Qianqiu and the art director of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
"My name is Shiya."
 

 
The camera automatically captured the lead character's movements, giving a shot of the female lead stretching after waking up.
 

 
Tong Zhao, dressed only in a white silk camisole, bathed in the soft morning light. The floral print on the curtains cast intricate shadows on her pale white arms, making her appear even more ethereal. One of the similarities between instinctive cinema and traditional cinema is that it allows the actor’s face to be modeled with makeup and claims this is their bare face just after waking up...
 

 
But Tong Zhao didn’t need that.
 

 
She didn’t require makeup.
 

 
Even the template designer was amazed—she could wake up early in the morning, fresh-faced, without any makeup, and still hold up to high-definition filming without a single flaw. At that moment, her expression was slightly drowsy, and a yawn caused a physiological tear, moistening her almond-shaped eyes, giving her a strong youthful vibe.
 

 
The maid, who had gotten up even earlier, stood by the bed with her hands at her sides. Once her mistress finished stretching, she skillfully helped her get dressed.
 

 
"It was always my mom who helped me get dressed. After she pulled a muscle last month, I heard the doctor told her she had to sit in a wheelchair for half a month. She reluctantly let Sister Mianmian help me instead."
 

 
"Although it feels a bit wrong..."
 

 
"But because of this, I now have one more person I can see, so I’m kind of happy."
 

 
“Sister Mianmian, I can do this myself.”
 

 
Seeing the maid about to kneel down to help her put on her shoes, Tong Zhao kindly stopped her.
 

 
The maid, however, hurriedly lowered her head, saying, "Miss, please don’t call me by my name. Madam might be upset if she hears."
 

 
The maid, with her head lowered, didn't notice the look of disappointment that appeared on Tong Zhao's face.
 

 
"I have a pair of very wealthy and loving parents."
 

 
"—It's just that they don’t like me interacting with others."
# Chapter108
The filming period for ‘The Neverland Girl’ turned out to be much longer than the industry had expected.
 

 
Generally speaking, the more special effects and large-scale scenes a movie has, the longer it takes to shoot. If the movie spans a large time period, the actors need to take breaks from the shooting tent at regular intervals, which extends the filming schedule. But ‘The Neverland Girl’... it was said to be a love story set in a luxurious mansion, with the main characters meeting online. Does it really need that much time to shoot?
 

 
Could it be that there are a lot of special effects in the villa?
 

 
The staff signed confidentiality agreements, and director Shi Qianqiu wouldn’t reveal anything, so outsiders could only guess, and the speculation was getting more intense, becoming more and more outlandish.
 

 
There was another theory.
 

 
That is, Tong Zhao had gone overboard.
 

 
He had to play two roles in a variety show, which was a sacrifice for the program team, and showed his loyalty. But could he really apply the same approach to filming a serious movie? Wasn’t he overestimating his subconscious while underestimating the difficulty of acting in a real movie? This led to a lot of criticism, and even the director, Shi Qianqiu, was seen as someone who loved stirring up trouble. Could this romance film really be reliable?
 

 
Some industry peers took advantage of the situation, and there were even whispers that competitors planning to release films around the same time were subtly shifting the narrative...
 

 
At first glance, the entire market had very little confidence in ‘The Neverland Girl’!
 

 
For other films, such rumors could damage investor confidence, leading to a conservative attitude towards marketing and distribution, ultimately creating a vicious cycle for the movie’s release. After all, in the entertainment industry, both star-making and box office revenue rely heavily on hype and traffic.
 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was different.
 

 
Whether or not the investment was made depended entirely on how Tong Zhao felt, and then on the director’s name.
 

 
Well, even if this movie was short on funds, it likely wouldn’t need to look for outside help.
 

 
Journalists, like hyenas smelling blood, flocked to the scene, using all their connections and methods to dig up any information from the crew. There’s no wall that doesn’t leak, and through their relentless efforts and mysterious tactics, they finally managed to uncover a piece of information.
 

 
What was it?
 

 
During the filming of ‘The Neverland Girl’, an additional investment was made. The amount remains undisclosed. This investment wasn’t publicly announced and was quietly added. If not for the reporters obsessively digging for details, it likely wouldn’t have been revealed. Where was this extra funding used? Was there a miscalculation in the budget? Is this yet another issue with a film funded by Tong Zhao? Countless questions were raised, but no one from the production team came forward to respond.
 

 
# ‘The Neverland Girl’ Suspected of Financial Issues
 
# Tong Zhao's First Major Setback
 

 
Voices predicting failure were everywhere, and such negativity should have shaken the confidence of potential moviegoers.
 

 
However, this common scenario seemed ineffective when it came to Tong Zhao. It was almost as though the public had a soft spot for her. The truth was simpler: her past works were so exceptional that they had instilled a reflexive thought in viewers—’Tong Zhao = Worth Watching’. The industry was shocked to uncover a startling fact:
 

 
These typical negative rumors, which would usually dampen the spirits of most film crews, had no impact on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Like many established veteran actors, she had achieved the rare ability to carry a film’s box office performance entirely on her own.
 

 
[Not listening, just watching Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Whether the movie is good or not, I’ll decide after watching it. How can you criticize a film that hasn’t even released a trailer?]
 

 
[A movie featuring Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu running out of money? That’s laughable.]
 

 
Fans naturally hoped their idol would continue to rise, each film breaking new records, becoming a walking miracle. This sentiment was true for most celebrities, but for Tong Zhao—who had repeatedly succeeded with vastly different genres—fans were even more fervent in their desire for her to deliver a perfect masterpiece.
 

 
One entertainment blogger commented:
 

 
[Are film critics being too harsh on Tong Zhao? Actually, the person who is the harshest on Tong Zhao is herself. After her success as the noble consort in ‘Emperor Ming’, she could have easily taken on more palace intrigue costume dramas. Smooth sailing, right? But she didn’t. After ‘72 Hours Countdown’, she had the perfect opportunity to transition into big-budget action movies—a guaranteed box office hit. Easy money, right? But she declined. I even saw someone on a forum say Tong Zhao has the kind of face that makes people want to fall in love, but she never takes on the safest romantic films. Romance movies? Too easy for her, apparently.
 

 
Yet, what did she do? She filmed one anyway. Surprising, isn’t it?
 

 
Even more surprising, she managed to drag Shi Qianqiu along with her.]
 

 
This entertainment blogger’s post didn’t have any manipulated comments, just genuine opinions from fans and casual viewers. The mainstream sentiment was one of recognition for Tong Zhao. A male fan who had followed her gaming livestreams shared his thoughts:
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s livestreams? I’ve watched every single one. If I missed a live session, I’d catch the replay. I can tell you, from her gaming style alone, you can see she’s adventurous and bold, willing to take risks and show off her skills. You can see this in her attitude towards life as well.]
 

 
Netizens were curious: ‘Has she always been this brave?’
 

 
She really has.
 

 
Some fans even edited a short clip from one of her livestreams.
 

 
In the clip, Tong Zhao is playing a hero character and pulls off two extreme plays in a row while barely surviving on low health, as if walking a tightrope. The chat is filled with comments asking how she dared to make such moves. Smirking, she replied, “Why wouldn’t I dare? Am I afraid of losing? Only those who dare to lose deserve to win.”
 

 
Her expression was full of wild confidence.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s usual public demeanor is calm and composed. It’s only during these rare livestream sessions that fans glimpse her youthful, daring side, and they absolutely love it. After every livestream, platforms like Douyin and Weibo explode with expertly edited highlight clips of her, attracting a whole new crowd of non-moviegoing fans. Many marvel at her gaming skills, saying, “If she became a full-time streamer, she’d definitely go viral. Why is she a movie star instead?”
 

 
One screenshot of her with a puzzled expression, paired with the quote “Am I afraid of losing?”, became a favorite response among fans to counter the critics doubting her.
 

 
So, how did ‘The Neverland Girl’ turn out?
 

 
The first ones to find out were critics and industry insiders.
 

 
Film previews come in many forms: some are rough cuts meant for internal viewing, requiring strict non-disclosure agreements, while others are polished, final versions. The preview for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was the latter. Many media professionals were invited to this event. Although the attendees signed confidentiality agreements barring them from discussing the plot in detail, they were allowed to share their overall impressions.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng was one of the invited critics.
 

 
When he received the invitation, Luo Yuanfeng was surprised.
 

 
He hadn’t expected to be invited.
 

 
It wasn't due to a lack of reputation. Luo Yuanfeng was a fairly influential film critic in the Chinese film industry. Since the advent of instinctive films, ticket prices had risen, and audiences became more cautious about a film’s quality before purchasing viewing rights. Luo Yuanfeng's review column, ‘Luo's Instinctive Musings’, brought him steady income with each new review. This revenue came from the film review site ‘Now Showing’, which paid him based on the number of clicks. Additionally, he received a share of the advertising revenue.
 

 
If a film critic overly compromised their credibility for money, it would harm their reputation, and ‘Now Showing’ would reduce their weight on the platform, indirectly limiting their exposure. Under the site’s strict oversight, most critics took great care to protect their reputations, leading to relatively fair reviews.
 

 
Among the well-known critics, Luo Yuanfeng was part of the camp predicting Tong Zhao’s new movie would fail.
 

 
If the film turned out well, fine.
 

 
But if anything was off, he was ready to tear it apart.
 

 
"It seems Tong Zhao has a lot of confidence in this movie," Luo Yuanfeng remarked to the critic seated next to him. "I don't know if I should hope for it to flop... It's a weird feeling. I kind of want to be proven wrong but also dread being disappointed."
 

 
"You’re overthinking it. I feel like just seeing Tong Zhao’s face in a romance is worth the ticket price."
 

 
This sentiment mirrored the broader public opinion.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s movies were undeniably entertaining and worth the price of admission. However, she had never played out a romance that truly resonated with audiences. Even in the closest attempt, ‘Heartless Tribulation’, viewers mostly felt her overwhelming hatred and solitary intensity. Any love she had for the male lead in flashback scenes was largely the product of Shi Qianqiu’s editing.
 

 
And most importantly, the scumbag male lead didn’t deserve her!
 

 
But Han Zhi? He was perfect!
 

 
From keyword trends and search data, it became clear that seeing Tong Zhao experience a sweet romance in a movie was a key excitement factor for many young fans.
 

 
"Do you think she’s even capable of romance?" someone wondered.
 

 
"I feel like she’s already crushed most of her male fans’ dreams."
 

 
"I’m probably more of a ‘younger brother fan.’ She’s my ideal big sister type."
 

 
...
 

 
Without needing a reminder, the room fell silent as the lights dimmed for the screening.
 

 
With a critical mindset, Luo Yuanfeng leaned forward slightly, focusing his attention to the maximum.
 

 
If this was a good film, he would write an honest review.
 

 
If Tong Zhao’s performance fell short...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng had no intention of holding back.
 

 
Beyond the questions of her dual role performance and whether she could convincingly portray romance, another thought lingered in his mind: what exactly had that mysterious additional funding been used for?
 

 
The movie began with a young, childlike version of Tong Zhao leaning lovingly against her mother in a cozy children's room, listening to her tell the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
 

 
Instinctive films, like traditional movies, often cast child actors resembling the adult leads to portray their childhood selves. The difference, however, lies in the nuances—subtle body adjustments in modeling aren't the same as complete overhauls. When an adult's subconscious is projected onto a childlike frame, the result can feel uncanny. Yet this film opened with an unconventional approach.
 

 
It must be said: the "mini" version of Tong Zhao was utterly adorable.
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng, the self-proclaimed stone-hearted critic who had lambasted the entire entertainment industry, felt an inexplicable pang of guilt when he saw the character's bright, teary eyes. ‘How could I possibly criticize such a sweet little girl?’ he thought. ‘If she wants to make this movie, let her do it!’
 

 
"I wish I could be like Peter Pan and never grow up," mini Tong Zhao declared.
 

 
"Then stay by Mom and Dad’s side forever, okay?" her mother replied.
 

 
"Okay!"
 

 
The little Zhao cuddled against her mother, playfully rolling on her lap.
 

 
But she rolled too far—landing with a soft ‘plop’ onto a cushioned mat on the floor. Holding her forehead in her tiny hands, she looked up at her mother in bewilderment.
 

 
...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng thought to himself, ‘I shouldn’t have mocked that fan who called himself her “little brother.”
 

 
‘Now I want to be her “dad fan”!’
 

 
He noticed how little Zhao, nestled beside her mother, would occasionally tug gently at her skirt with her small fingers or nuzzle her soft, chubby cheeks against her mother’s hand.
 

 
These were subtle, childlike gestures unique to this younger version of Tong Zhao—gestures completely absent in her adult self.
 

 
How was she able to do this?
 

 
Seeing this petite version of Tong Zhao, Luo Yuanfeng saw not only an impossibly cute little girl but also a phenomenon beyond comprehension. The same subconscious mind that could switch between cold ruthlessness and captivating allure in her adult roles somehow managed to adjust its temperament to perfectly suit a childlike innocence.
 

 
But how could an adult’s subconscious fit so seamlessly into the body of a child?
 

 
And not just any adult—a celebrity’s subconscious at that!
 

 
In Shi Qianqiu’s lens, Luo Yuanfeng felt as though he were truly traveling through time, catching a glimpse of Tong Zhao before her family life was upended.
 

 
The screening room, filled with some of the most disciplined and professional viewers, couldn't help themselves. At that moment, the audience broke into soft murmurs, marveling at what they were witnessing.
# Chapter109
Incredible...
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng couldn't focus on analyzing the rest of the movie's plot.
 

 
The mini version of Tong Zhao on the screen even seemed a bit unfamiliar. As someone who had been closely following the rise of this popular star, Luo Yuanfeng knew her better than many of Tong Zhao's fans... though of course, he couldn’t say they were particularly close. The Tong Zhao he knew was the epitome of mature and cold beauty. He had even had the privilege of witnessing her display her charm at the premiere of ‘Heartless Tribulation’.
 

 
Of course, many idol stars who were new and lacked background would subconsciously flaunt their charms to gain attention and special treatment, with some going so far as to overstep boundaries. After all, many powerful figures in those circles controlled resources that newcomers desperately sought. Luo Yuanfeng didn’t judge these people, but Tong Zhao was different. Every frown and smile of hers exuded a mature, seductive charm, yet she always knew how to keep things perfectly balanced... At least, no one who had interacted with her felt that she was the type of star who could be bought with money.
 

 
She was the kind of unattainable, unreachable beauty.
 

 
Yet, people still wanted to exert effort to please her, to win her favor, just to see her turn around and smile at them.
 

 
In short, Luo Yuanfeng’s impression of Tong Zhao was that of a mature, cold, fox-like beauty.
 

 
What Luo Yuanfeng didn’t know was that the Tong Zhao he had seen back then—
 

 
Was the very same rare personality who hardly ever appeared in real life. If she did appear, her WeChat contacts would inevitably gain a flood of high-profile, influential personalities: Consort Chen.
 

 
After the childhood of the female lead was revealed, the scene in the movie shifted, and grown-up Sylia appeared. Shi Qianqiu, a director with extensive experience, not only packed the screen with enough visual information, but his shot composition also allowed the audience to easily understand the kind of environment the female lead grew up in. The buildings on screen were magnificent, and her parents were overly doting on her, yet the audience could still sense that something was off.
 

 
Seeing this, Luo Yuanfeng quickly forced himself to snap out of his shock over the younger version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Summon your professional spirit!
 

 
Focus on finishing the movie. This early screening doesn’t offer a replay.
 

 
‘Shi Qianqiu is a genius at directing…’
 

 
‘Who’s the art director for this film? Shi’s aesthetic sense remains top-tier.’
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng knew the primary filming location for ‘The Neverland Girl’ was a bare-bones villa with a small garden at most.
 

 
What appeared on the big screen, however, was far beyond that. Every blade of grass and every tree exuded the painstaking efforts of the art director and the production team. The setting lacked any ostentatious "new money" vibe and didn’t conform to the reserved elegance of "old money." Instead, the exaggerated details and lighting crafted a dreamlike fairy-tale world.
 

 
Just as Luo Yuanfeng was reflecting on this, the adult Tong Zhao made her appearance.
 

 
’This isn’t the same Tong Zhao I’ve seen in person.’
 

 
Accompanied by lighthearted music, Tong Zhao appeared on screen bathed in the golden glow of morning sunlight. "Tong Zhao always looks so stunning under Director Shi’s lens," someone whispered. "Didn’t they have some romance rumors recently? Maybe there’s some truth to it." When Tong Zhao flashed a slightly sleepy, lazy smile at a maid, Luo Yuanfeng began to doubt his own memories.
 

 
It’s a well-known fact in the entertainment industry that many celebrities’ public personas are fabricated. Believing the personas crafted by entertainment companies to be the stars' true selves would make anyone a fool.
 

 
Typically, the consensus is that these stars—often masters of time management, notorious heartthrobs, or femme fatales—pretend to be innocent in front of the camera. But with Tong Zhao, the situation seemed reversed. Could it be that her usual seductive, coldly elegant, and wise demeanor was an act? Was she, in reality, a sweet and soft-hearted young girl? Or even capable of convincingly playing a childlike role?
 

 
Luo Yuanfeng wasn’t alone in his astonishment.
 

 
Most critics had expected Tong Zhao’s take on a romance film to feature a dynamic where, even if not female-dominated, there would at least be equality in power and agency.
 

 
But wait—who was this obedient, innocent darling who seemed ready to be whisked away by any man?
 

 
Was ‘Sylia’ played by some freshly debuted young idol?
 

 
And, oh, it looked like someone was actually going to kidnap her character!
 

 
Some critics who hadn’t read the script beforehand sighed when Han Zhi made his entrance. “If Tong Zhao were a man,” they remarked, “there’d be no competition for male leads in the industry—this guy’s charm is off the charts...”
 

 
Wait, what?
 

 
This guy’s a con artist?
 

 
Han Zhi, doubting that his girlfriend’s mental state had truly reverted to that of a child, infiltrated the Si family as a doctor. Seizing a moment when they were alone, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her, leaning close. “You really don’t remember anything?” Sylia shook her head, staring at him in confusion. He kissed her again, this time more passionately. “Truly don’t remember, or just pretending not to?”
 

 
And so, he kissed her again. And again. And again...
 

 
Critics & special audience members: ..
 

 
Anger rising. Fists clenched.
 

 
This scene went surprisingly smoothly, something Shi Qianqiu hadn’t anticipated.
 

 
After her subconscious was "juvenilized," Tong Zhao's personality became simple and naive but still remained firm and proactive—a child with her own strong opinions. She didn’t seem like someone who would passively allow a strange man to shower her with a whirlwind of kisses. However, Han Zhi was essentially ‘Tong Zhao herself’. Subconsciously, Zhao Zai (the childlike version of Tong Zhao) felt an instinctive closeness to that face. In her subconscious mind palace, only Han Zhi and Lu Xianzhang (another character) had her trust, while the Imperial Concubine sister constantly bullied her.
 

 
When it came to projecting a sense of youthful innocence, Tong Zhao employed a bit of cleverness.
 

 
The system she worked with didn’t include any marketplace or rewards like "beauty boosts" or "superpowers." Its sole function was to motivate her to live each life meaningfully and actively complete tasks in different worlds. The system shielded her from becoming apathetic or detached—a “zen-like old soul” who felt indifferent to everything. As part of this, the system allowed her to temporarily block certain memories and experiences upon request.
 

 
Before entering the immersion pod, Tong Zhao chose to erase all memories of her multi-world journeys, resetting herself to the state she had been in before her mother passed away.
 

 
At that time, she hadn’t yet learned that her best friend was actually her half-sister, nor had she realized how swiftly she could fall from her privileged, sheltered life into the harsh reality of the world. Back then, she was still a well-protected young heiress.
 

 
About a third into the movie, the critics finally understood where the additional funding had gone.
 

 
After Sylia’s attempted suicide resulted in her mind regressing to that of a child, the entire world as seen through her eyes was enhanced with breathtaking, extremely expensive special effects! The sun smiled down at her, clouds had soft pink edges, and every brick, tile, plant, and blade of grass in the villa’s garden shimmered under a painterly, vividly saturated filter.
 

 
What’s more, Shi Qianqiu’s masterful touch ensured that none of it looked garish or cheap. The vibrant visuals, paired with Sylia’s innocent and joyful smiles, were absolutely mesmerizing!
 

 
It was as if two distinct worlds had been built on the same set of production codes.
 

 
Although the scope of the scenes wasn’t expansive, this technique...
 

 
It was classic Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
This technique, where the external scenery shifts along with the character's emotional changes, is more commonly seen in exaggerated animation. In live-action romance films without fantasy elements, it’s rare to employ such a method. However, this bold approach undeniably delivered a visual feast to the audience.
 

 
With Tong Zhao and Han Zhi already boasting top-tier looks, Shi Qianqiu’s lens elevated their beauty to almost unbearable levels.
 

 
‘Wow, if this movie becomes a hit, forget about Director Shi—this art director’s worth will skyrocket!’
 

 
Zhao Zai’s subconscious stubbornness altered the script yet again. The "childlike regression" didn’t lower her intelligence. She faintly sensed something suspicious about the male lead. However, Han Zhi was a grandmaster at deceiving both women and children. The push-and-pull dynamic between them sparked unique chemistry. By the middle of the film, Luo Yuanfeng had numbly accepted the reality that beneath Tong Zhao’s icy exterior lay a pure and tender soul.
 

 
It was astonishing. Although she had the appearance of a teenage girl, she was unmistakably just a child at heart.
 

 
And the male lead? He could still make a move?
 

 
‘Beast. Utter beast!’
 

 
In truth, apart from the initial whirlwind of kisses during his "test" of his girlfriend, Han Zhi’s most intimate actions afterward were limited to holding hands, hugging, or forehead kisses. There was no question of crossing the line. Yet, somehow, the live audience had unconsciously unified as overprotective "dad fans."
 

 
For a doting father, even a stranger glancing at his precious daughter was a sin!
 

 
‘Holding hands? Chop that paw off!’
 

 
---
 

 
During the backstage shoot, the crew closely monitored Zhao Zai’s psychological activity. When they noticed she had caught onto something suspicious about the male lead Nie Su, they were prepared to intervene and adjust the plot. After all, in the original script, Sylia remained completely oblivious until she regained her memories, at which point Nie Su confessed the truth, having been moved by her.
 

 
But what do you do when the heroine is too perceptive and figures out the male lead is a scumbag liar ahead of schedule?
 

 
Zhao Zai was too sharp!
 

 
However, Han Zhi, another facet of Tong Zhao’s personality, was equally formidable.
 

 
He withstood Zhao Zai’s growing suspicions and managed to explain away one inconsistency after another. While he admitted he had been hiding something, he assured her:
 

 
"I promise you, whatever I’m concealing is not meant to hurt you."
 

 
From Zhao Zai's perspective, the little bridge and flowing water in the villa's garden not only had water, but also a shimmering galaxy. Han Zhi’s character, Nie Su, gazed at her seriously, his eyes full of deep affection and inescapable melancholy. He had truly fallen for her, but the reality was that his girlfriend’s mental state had regressed to that of a child due to her refusal to grow up, and the cruel fact that their family backgrounds were worlds apart.
 

 
The reason behind the heroine’s mental regression, apart from the trauma from her suicide, was also the emotional manipulation and moral coercion from her parents, which had caused her to break down.
 

 
Since she couldn’t have freedom, she would rather not have it at all.
 

 
It was not that her parents didn’t want to let her go, but that she didn’t want to grow up, didn’t want to leave the house. As long as she stood on the same side as her parents, staying as the obedient child who didn’t want to leave home, she wouldn’t hurt anyone, and she wouldn’t suffer anymore.
 

 
Nie Su wasn’t a real psychologist, but he was the person who understood Sylia better than anyone else in the world.
 

 
In their previous online relationship, there were many things Sylia couldn’t say to her parents, but she had confided in him, speaking very frankly. Nie Su had vaguely sensed her emotional struggles and was troubled about how to rekindle her desire for growth.
 

 
And Sylia, gazing at Nie Su, felt a faint blush rise on her cheeks.
 

 
The moon in the sky, influenced by her emotional change, turned from yellow to red in an instant and shyly hid behind the clouds.
 

 
While the male lead was still troubled about how to make her want to grow up…
 

 
Due to the awakening of her romantic feelings, she now had a slight desire to grow up.
 

 
As the subconscious influence of Tong Zhao altered the plot, Shi Qianqiu didn’t stop it—in fact, he welcomed the change.
 

 
Change it! Keep changing it!
 

 
Thus, although the male lead didn’t say it directly, it was essentially exposed ahead of time.
 

 
In the original script, in order to ignite the heroine’s desire for the outside world, Nie Su had idealized much of it. This led to the eventual confession where he revealed that the adult world wasn’t as great as it seemed and was full of bad people—he was one of them.
 

 
However, Han Zhi’s subconscious slowly began to share his true situation with the heroine.
 

 
Zhao Zai listened, realizing that her big brother had done a lot of bad things!
 

 
Han Zhi: "So if you keep being picky and refuse to eat your green peppers, but then eat a whole bag of candy every day, you'll end up like me—living by lying to people and getting cavities."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so shocked that she covered her cheek, which was aching slightly from her teeth.
 

 
Zhao Zai still liked her big brother a lot. She wanted to change him.
 

 
"I’m not going to listen to a little kid. You need to grow up quickly if you want to teach me a lesson."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and patted her head.
# Chapter110
Love is a complex emotion.
 

 
Adults often say, “What do kids know about love?” But in reality, many adults don’t truly understand what love is either. In English, there’s a term, ‘puppy love’, to describe this kind of innocent, naive affection—like puppies snuggling together, radiating pure sincerity without any impurities.
 

 
What is love, and why must we understand it?
 
How does one learn to love and to be loved? Is there a course or a major dedicated to the art of pursuing someone romantically?
 
When is it time to give up on love? How can one determine the value of persistence or know if they truly like someone, as opposed to just following others’ opinions that they *seem like a good match*?
 

 
Han Zhi scored major points in front of the female protagonist’s parents, making them fully believe that he was helping their daughter recover from her psychological issues.
 

 
But the truth? Han Zhi didn’t know a thing about it.
 

 
The script hadn’t provided him with any professional psychology expertise, nor did Han Zhi have any training in the field. Every day, under the guise of “treatment,” he taught the female protagonist all the practical knowledge a functioning adult needs to navigate society.
 

 
In a quiet underground library surrounded by wooden bookshelves, the shelves were filled with the Shi family’s private collection. However, starkly contrasting with the intellectual tomes were the brightly colored children’s books on the bottom two shelves. These were bought by her parents when Sylia was younger, positioned to match her height at the time. Even now, her parents still firmly believed she should be reading these books.
 

 
Dressed in a white floral dress, Sylia slumped ungracefully over the desk and lazily lifted her gaze toward Nie Su. “Big Brother Nie, what are we learning today?”
 

 
Nie Su placed his laptop on the desk and opened a document.
 

 
The document’s title read: “100 Ways to Teach the Mentally Inept How to Live.”
 

 
Sylia’s sharp eyes caught the title and asked curiously, “What does ‘mentally inept’ mean?”
 

 
“A low-energy lifestyle,” Nie Su explained with a straight face, “is just another name for the trendy low-carbon lifestyle.” He added, “Don’t mention this term in front of your dad.”
 

 
“That means it’s a bad word,” Sylia declared confidently.
 

 
“You’re the hardest kid I’ve ever had to fool.”
 

 
“Really? Even compared to when you were a kid, Brother Nie?”
 

 
“Almost,” Nie Su admitted, pulling up the day’s lesson plan. “Because when I was a kid, I was the one fooling others.”
 

 
Sylia’s round almond eyes widened in shock at this revelation.
 

 
The camera zoomed in, revealing the day’s topics on Nie Su’s screen:
 

 
- How to Find a Suitable Job? (Subtopics: Avoiding MLM scams, workplace manipulation, and exploitative environments)
 
- How to Make New Friends? (Subtopics: Identifying malicious intentions in fake friends)
 
- How to Avoid Saying the Wrong Thing
 
- The Dynamics of Mutual Exploitation in Relationships
 
- How to Reject Pursuers (Highlighted and in bold!!!)
 

 
…
 

 
The audience quickly realized that aside from the suspicious self-interest in the last topic, the rest were essential life lessons. These were things schools never teach but that everyone is expected to know as soon as they step into the real world.
 

 
Though Sylia had never attended a formal school, she was taught by private tutors from a young age. Her academic knowledge matched that of a typical college student, but it ended there. Her parents, fearful that too much education might make her want to leave home, limited her learning—but couldn’t bear to leave her entirely uneducated.
 

 
Sylia tilted her head in doubt. “What’s the point of learning all this?”
 

 
“Every adult needs to know these things,” Nie Su replied with a faintly mocking smile on his otherwise composed face. “Schools teach you math, languages, and science. Your family teaches you morality and values. But when you enter society, all you’ll face are scams, cons, lies, and traps. Those without strong minds end up addicted to gambling, drugs, and other vices.”
 

 
The phrasing of this line—short, snappy, and full of rhythm—drew laughs from the audience. But after the laughter, many found themselves reflecting: wasn’t there a grain of truth in his words?
 

 
Nie Su laid bare the cruel and harsh realities of society for Sylia, teaching her about the darker aspects of life.
 

 
Yet, in contrast to his scheming and jaded worldview, Sylia was like a pure little angel untouched by the world’s corruption. Through these lessons, she unintentionally offered him a new perspective. While the characters had the physical forms of mature adults, the audience couldn’t help but see them as two adorable, innocent children rolling around on a grassy field—endearingly sweet and heartwarming.
 

 
Although she knew she couldn’t enjoy whirlwind kisses forever without growing up, the pure-hearted Sylia thought these days weren’t bad at all.
 

 
As long as Brother Nie was by her side, the outside world didn’t seem so tempting anymore.
 

 
---
 

 
During the filming of this segment, the writers’ team became quite anxious.
 

 
The climax of ‘Neverland Girl’ was supposed to involve the male protagonist confessing to the female lead that he was a liar—a bad person.
 

 
But now? A villain?
 

 
The female lead had already figured that out and was even trying to reform him. On top of that, the male lead seemed nearly reformed already.
 

 
At this rate, the story was heading straight for a happily-ever-after ending, skipping the drama entirely.
 

 
A happily-ever-after ending is nice, but it can sometimes feel lacking in drama, leaving the story less grand and impactful. Most creators share the same dilemma: readers wish for the protagonists to live happily ever after, perhaps even getting married and enjoying lifelong bliss. Meanwhile, the author muses, “Should I throw in a natural disaster or a human tragedy first?”—to heighten the pacing and dramatic tension.
 

 
The screenwriters were worried, but Shi Qianqiu, the director, remained calm.
 

 
He trusted Tong Zhao's subconscious meddling abilities, especially her male alter-ego named "Han Zhi," who excelled at stirring things up in matters of love.
 

 
And sure enough—
 

 
Nie Su, played by Han Zhi, discovered that Sylia had fallen in love with him once again. She still didn’t want to grow up, but this time, it wasn’t out of pain or self-loathing. Instead, it stemmed from sweet happiness, a desire to remain in this blissful state. Adding to the tension, Shi’s parents had begun to notice the sparks between the two. Shi’s father made a bold proposal: he offered a high salary to essentially “buy” Nie Su’s life, on the condition that Nie Su stayed with their daughter, never leaving, and guarding their home forever.
 

 
As long as their daughter was happy and stayed within the safe and warm confines of the house, the parents were willing to make any compromise.
 

 
Of course, children moving out for work and returning home for meals and rest is perfectly normal. In the Shi family’s case, with their immense wealth, even living with her parents after marriage wouldn’t be an issue. As the most level-headed character in the entire film, Nie Su understood that the parents, too, had psychological issues. However, their actions—though flawed—were rooted in love and would never harm their daughter.
 

 
In a society under such high pressure, who doesn’t carry a few mental scars?
 

 
Nie Su left behind a recording and quit his job, disappearing from their lives.
 

 
---
 

 
The Recording:
 
“I know you’ve been reading romance novels recently. Some male protagonists tell their heroines that as long as they’re around, the heroine can remain a child forever. I might not be someone capable of offering that kind of promise. Your parents, on the other hand, probably can.
 

 
But I believe that only by becoming an adult first can one have the privilege of choosing to act like a child in front of someone special.”
 

 
“This is the last lesson I’ll teach you, kid.”
 

 
“When you grow up… you’ll find that some relationships don’t end with arguments or betrayals. Sometimes, they end simply because two people choose different paths. When the final goodbye arrives, it’s often without warning. Later, when you think back on it, you’ll wish you had known it was the last meeting—so you could hug that person tightly.”
 

 
Nie Su let out a soft laugh—a gentle, warm sound. Even the distortion of the old tape recorder couldn’t obscure his exceptional voice.
 

 
“Not wanting to grow up isn’t wrong. The adult world isn’t that great, after all.
 

 
But I refuse to be the reason you develop a new kind of illness.”
 

 
“I’m a failed adult. There’s only so much I can teach you. If, in the future, you come to new realizations and insights, trust yourself. Don’t doubt your judgment. I believe you’ll grow into an adult who’s a thousand times better than I ever was.”
 

 
“Kid, I really like you.”
 

 
“But the one I love is Sylia.”
 

 
---
 

 
At this point, the director seamlessly tied all the narrative threads together:
 

 
From the very beginning, Nie Su had loved Sylia. Their relationship had started as an online romance, despite having never met in person. It was this love that prevented him from committing greater crimes. He gave up his "pig butchering scam" schemes for wealth, sought her out when she vanished from his life, and helped her resolve her emotional burdens.
 

 
Because of his exceptional emotional intelligence, Nie Su realized that his presence made it easier for Sylia to cope with her struggles. Yet he also knew that deep down, she still wanted to grow up.
 

 
This wasn’t about money. The innate curiosity and desire to explore the unknown are fundamental instincts of childhood.
 

 
Sylia burst into tears. After crying her heart out, she wiped her eyes and prepared to chase after him.
 

 
Nie Su’s guess was correct. Sylia indeed resolved her inner struggles because of him. She stood her ground before her parents, promising she would always come home early, and even if she stayed out all night, she would inform them where she was staying.
 

 
With her parents' support, Sylia began to take on the family business while searching for Nie Su.
 

 
In the closing scenes of the film, traces of the Shi parents’ overprotectiveness remained. For example, if Sylia had to go on a week-long business trip and her aging parents couldn’t physically accompany her, they would rent out the entire hotel where she stayed to ensure no dangerous individuals could book nearby rooms. This kind of extravagant behavior exasperated Sylia, who turned the resourcefulness to her advantage by hosting her business partners at the hotel.
 

 
Every piece of practical advice Nie Su had taught her about surviving adulthood came in handy.
 

 
But she couldn’t find Nie Su.
 

 
Now free to live her life, Sylia developed a deep passion for learning. Every quarter, she hired a private tutor to teach her a new skill three times a week during her free time from work. This might include cooking French cuisine, driving, flower arranging, tea ceremonies, electrical work, or painting—anything that seemed like a worthwhile craft. Anyone who thought they could teach the heiress a useful skill was welcome to apply.
 

 
However, the job posting included one peculiar, non-mandatory requirement:
 

 
“Preference will be given to candidates with the surname Nie.”
 

 
Sylia knew he would understand. As long as this job posting remained, it was her way of telling him that he would always hold the top priority in her heart.
 

 
Meanwhile, after repaying his debts and finding his footing in life, Nie Su finally appeared late one night in front of the towering Shi Corporation building after an exhausting overtime shift.
 

 
This time, when they met again, they were both weary yet hopeful adults, each with a clear direction in life.

As the film came to an end, thunderous applause erupted.
 

 
Since this was a preview screening, the audience consisted of movie enthusiasts and seasoned viewers. They had quietly endured the film up until this moment, and now their pent-up excitement poured forth in an explosion of commentary:
 

 
“I never thought Tong Zhao’s portrayal of romance could be this moving.”
 

 
“I think it’s thanks to the male lead. His emotions were expressed with such subtlety.”
 

 
“True, you can’t deny that. His controversial past made his character more layered and complex. In comparison, Tong Zhao’s character felt a bit simpler. But her performance as Sylia deserves a perfect score—can anyone explain to me how she managed to embody the psyche of a child without making it seem unnatural!?”
 

 
Amidst the heated debate over whether the male or female lead performed better, someone tentatively chimed in:
 

 
“Uh… you do realize the male lead was also played by Tong Zhao, right?”
 

 
This revelation brought an abrupt hush to the once-lively discussion.
 

 
Tong Zhao was like an exquisite, multifaceted wine. Poured into different vessels, she could reflect an array of dazzling lights.
 

 
The only constant across all her portrayals was that she always shone so brilliantly.
# Chapter111
After a brief silence, the screening hall buzzed with activity.
 

 
As the lights in the hall brightened, a few staff members entered, and in their midst, smiling warmly, was the movie's leading actress, Tong Zhao. Her appearance was greeted with another wave of applause. When she picked up a wireless microphone and smiled at the audience, the applause gradually subsided.
 

 
“Hello, everyone. Did you enjoy the movie?”
 

 
The audience responded with unanimous cheers and applause. Tong Zhao graciously expressed her gratitude as the lead actress, then transitioned into the Q&A segment.
 

 
Once given permission to record, the invited reporters eagerly raised their cameras, trying to capture both Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu in the frame. The two had been the subject of rumors ever since their private meeting a while back.
 

 
Though that gossip had faded over time, the release of ‘Neverland Girl’ had inevitably brought them back into the spotlight.
 

 
Young, attractive, and undeniably wealthy, collaborating on a film together—it was an irresistible story for the media. Even without chasing scandalous headlines, positive coverage of these two was already a huge draw.
 

 
If they were truly dating, there seemed little reason to keep it under wraps. Tong Zhao’s PR team had always been skilled, and she wasn’t reliant on a fan base enamored with her single status. Unless, of course, theirs was a more casual relationship with no intention of commitment. After all, in their industry, such casual arrangements were not uncommon given the long periods of separation.
 

 
Serious relationships required one party to compromise significantly, and most romances in the entertainment world often unraveled due to clashing schedules. A quiet breakup would be considered a best-case scenario.
 

 
Publicizing a relationship, only to break up in two or three months? That would be damaging to their public image.
 

 
Ending things privately and then announcing the split six months later might work, but if someone caved to their biological urges in the meantime and was caught by paparazzi, it would result in a public outcry. The “cheater” would face backlash, while the “betrayed” party would garner sympathy but risk damaging their high-end image.
 

 
Thus, unless caught red-handed or overwhelmed by their emotions, most celebrities would insist they were just “friends” while dating a fellow entertainer. If the relationship stabilized, they could always go public later.
 

 
After some wandering thoughts, the reporters resigned themselves to the conclusion that unless there was undeniable evidence, these two would never publicly confirm a relationship. The dream of a breaking news story was dashed, but the cameras kept snapping away, aiming for any interactions or glances shared between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, the internet loved this kind of content.
 

 
“Is it true that what initially attracted you to ‘Neverland Girl’ was the script?”
 

 
“Yes,” Tong Zhao nodded with a smile. “I found it to be a captivating love story that balances entertainment and depth, and the roles really allowed me to showcase my strengths.”
 

 
...Well.
 

 
The critics who had confidently claimed that Tong Zhao wasn’t suited for romance films must’ve been feeling the sting now.
 

 
Their embarrassment was palpable yet impossible to deny. The film’s quality spoke for itself; there was no point in pretending otherwise.
 

 
“Is there any role that ‘isn’t’ suited for you? Probably not!”
 

 
The atmosphere at the screening was relaxed, and a well-known critic joked loudly.
 

 
The crowd erupted in laughter, with many chiming in agreement.
 

 
Half of the crowd genuinely believed that there wasn’t a role Tong Zhao couldn’t master.
 

 
The other half, who had previously doubted her, now shamelessly joined her fanbase, pretending nothing had ever happened.
 

 
“Actually, there are some roles I probably couldn’t pull off,” Tong Zhao admitted candidly. “For instance, my subconscious likely wouldn’t suit playing a submissive character—unless it’s due to external pressures, and there’s a redemption arc later. Otherwise, I’d probably break character.”
 

 
Hearing this, the audience realized she might be right. Tong Zhao had never played a submissive role.
 

 
In the era of instinctive films, it wasn’t unusual for actors to have roles they couldn’t tackle. Forcing them to diversify beyond their abilities often led to more harm than good. Some critics even nodded in agreement, whispering to their neighbors, “If Tong Zhao could settle down and focus on similar roles, it’d be great.”
 

 
Due to spoiler restrictions, some topics in the Q&A session were off-limits.
 

 
When the conversation touched on plot-related questions, they couldn’t go into too much detail. However, someone asked Shi Qianqiu, “Toward the end of the movie, we were all holding our breath! Director Shi, you’ve always had faith in Tong Zhao’s subconscious ability to handle adversity, but were you ever worried?”
 

 
“Oh, absolutely. And my worries came true,” Shi Qianqiu replied, furrowing his brows, his expression heavy with thought.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s good looks amplified the audience’s empathy. Could Tong Zhao have really fallen short in some way? The crowd leaned in eagerly.
 

 
“The script’s ending was open-ended, entirely dependent on how the protagonists’ subconscious performed. That’s a hallmark of instinctive romance films,” Shi explained. “But I was hoping for a more realistic conclusion...”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao, who knew Shi Qianqiu all too well, gave him a look of mild disdain.
 

 
Her gaze practically screamed ‘disapproval’.
 

 
The reporters perked up with excitement.
 

 
—Could there be tension between the lead actress and the director?
 

 
Using his wistful, intellectual tone, Shi Qianqiu elaborated on his ideal ending: “I envisioned Sylia fully integrating into this utilitarian world, treating her first love as a fond memory. She’d go from being the princess of Neverland to the queen of a business empire. Meanwhile, after repaying his debts, Nie Su joins a grueling 996 company, which turns out to be owned by Shi’s family. He ultimately dies from overwork due to continuous overtime. In a way, he sacrifices his life for his first love. I even planned out how this scene would be edited—his commercial value would perfectly match the worth of one tiny diamond on the tiara Sylia wears at her billion-dollar wedding.”
 

 
...
 

 
The room fell into an awkward silence.
 

 
Tong Zhao broke it with a sharp quip: “I think the first thing that should be cut is your commentary.”
 

 
“No way,” Shi Qianqiu retorted.
 

 
True to his reputation as a master of rebuttal, Shi Qianqiu clung to the microphone with determination. “I actually had a lot of ideas. When refining the script, I dug plenty of metaphorical holes for the leads—probably three major ones. After the public release, interested viewers are welcome to explore them.”
 

 
When Shi Qianqiu took over, the task of refining the script for ‘Neverland Girl’ fell entirely to him.
 

 
Writing scripts for holographic films was unlike traditional methods—it involved elements of programming. The more refined the script, the larger the workload, akin to creating a highly interactive ‘Galgame’. Shi Qianqiu’s apparent lack of interest in giving the leads a happy ending irked some critics who had become protective “dad fans” of Tong Zhao’s character.
 

 
“Don’t worry,” Shi Qianqiu reassured, smiling charmingly. “When it comes to digging holes, I’m a professional. Even if the protagonists fall into them, it won’t detract from the story’s brilliance. It just means the brilliance will take on a slightly different direction.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Hmm, to avoid reshooting and burning through our limited budget, my subconscious really gave it its all.”
 

 
The screening room erupted into laughter.
 

 
Because of the budget constraints, someone naturally asked about where the additional funding had been spent. This led to a discussion of another highlight of the film: after the female protagonist develops a psychological condition, everything around her takes on a dreamlike, fairy-tale quality. Flowers gently sway in sync with her joyful emotions, and when she hides under her blanket, it transforms into a secret base, complete with a tiny hanging lamp.
 

 
These visual wonders were a testament to the director's team and the art director's aesthetic vision and creativity.
 

 
With visuals like these, it seemed inevitable the film would secure a Best Visual Effects award.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, known for his willingness to spend generously, wasn’t using his own money this time. Thankfully, the investors trusted him and were willing to inject additional funds despite widespread skepticism at the time. Upon reflection, some critics realized that the investor was none other than Zeshan, the company helmed by Tong Zhao herself. Of course, she trusted her own judgment! In the entertainment industry, few could match Tong Zhao's confidence.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu commented, “This adjustment was Tong Zhao’s idea. I merely brought her vision to life.”
 

 
Suddenly, all eyes turned to Tong Zhao with newfound admiration.
 

 
What a talent—not only excelling in acting but also demonstrating sharp business acumen.
 

 
Everything she invested in seemed to succeed, and even a casual suggestion turned out to be a major highlight of the movie.
 

 
Most of the audience were savvy individuals.
 

 
At least, they were knowledgeable about instinctive films. They quickly recognized that ‘Neverland Girl’ had initially been a more artistic, low-budget project with minimal sets. Typically, even if the storyline was excellent and critically acclaimed, viewers would likely opt for the cheaper, traditional viewing format. This significantly reduced its appeal.
 

 
That’s why so many art films with box-office ambitions laboriously crammed in visual effects to boost their draw.
 

 
However, many such attempts felt forced, resulting in a disjointed mess. Tong Zhao’s idea, on the other hand, fit perfectly. Her suggestion might even open up a lucrative new direction for romantic films in the instinctive cinema genre. A whimsical fairy-tale romance that could explore deeper themes, much like Shi Qianqiu’s darker, grittier take beneath the fairy-tale veneer.
 

 
As Zeshan continued to expand, some critics who understood films admitted they were less informed about the business world.
 

 
Just how vast was the financial backing behind Tong Zhao?
 

 
Was ‘Neverland Girl’ merely a one-off experiment born out of necessity—when there was a great script but no suitable team—or was it a stepping stone for Tong Zhao’s evolution from actress to producer?
 

 
Eyes filled with curiosity and contemplation landed on Tong Zhao. What truly intrigued them now wasn’t just her beauty but how much further she could go in her career.
 

 
“I only came up with an idea,” Tong Zhao humbly clarified. “The hard work of turning my idea into a reality on screen was thanks to the director’s team and the art department. All the stunning visuals you see in the film are the result of their tireless efforts, painstakingly crafted from scratch. If credit is to be given, I’d say my contribution is worth one-tenth, at most.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t claim credit.
 

 
At the time, her motivation was simple: since “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of her) rarely had the chance to experience holographic filmmaking, she wanted her to have fun with it. Filming such projects felt a bit like living through a multidimensional travel adventure, and the aftereffects were profound. Tong Zhao’s suggestions were purely indulgent, fulfilling the childlike dreams of her subconscious self.
 

 
These were wild childhood fantasies she had long forgotten.
 

 
While the idea was brilliant, its success wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of the crew.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s exceptional aesthetic sense crafted a beautiful dream for “Zhao Zai” (the subconscious version of Tong Zhao).
 

 
With her "inner child" receiving such care, Tong Zhao found herself looking at Shi Qianqiu more favorably.
 

 
And Shi Qianqiu? He found her just as agreeable, eager to lock down their next collaboration, where he could plot new challenges for her to tackle.
 

 
---
 

 
The buzz about ‘Neverland Girl’ receiving critical acclaim quickly spread throughout the industry.
 

 
The art director’s reputation skyrocketed, and Shi Qianqiu—already known as a box office magnet—only solidified his legendary status. The additional accolades simply added more brilliance to the crown he wore with nonchalance.
 

 
Critics were raving:
 

 
- “A romantic visual spectacle, crafted by the most enchanting subconscious mind, creating this winter’s most poignant love story.”
 
- “A fairy tale for adults! Shi Qianqiu—the man who best understands how to tap into Tong Zhao’s subconscious charm.”
 
- “If only Han Zhi, the fictional male lead, really existed!”
 
- “Tong Zhao, I’m your dad!”
 

 
Aside from the last headline—a dramatic outburst from an overzealous fan critic—the reviews from those who attended the screening read as though they’d all been paid to shower the film with praise.
 

 
This stirred online debate: Was it an expensive PR stunt, or was the movie truly that good?
 

 
Of course, there were some more neutral takes:
 

 
- “The exaggerated character setups make it difficult for the film to deeply explore its intended themes. It barely scratches the surface, but it’s still an excellent romance movie.”
 
- “I don’t think this film deserves any plot-related awards, but it absolutely deserves a nomination for its visual effects.”
 
- “The entire movie leans on the charisma of the male and female leads’ subconscious minds.”
 

 
Overall, the praise outweighed the criticism.
 

 
The initial skepticism online about Tong Zhao playing two roles simultaneously vanished as if it had never existed. Instead, several critics lamented on social media and in their columns that no young actor in real life could match the allure of Han Zhi, the fictional male lead. "If only someone like him were real," they sighed.
 

 
With Shi Qianqiu’s masterful promotional strategy, the film’s marketing campaign was in full swing. It successfully brought Tong Zhao, who had deliberately reduced her public appearances recently, back into the spotlight.
 

 
However, the tactics used weren’t exactly conventional.
 

 
At the screening, reporters carefully selected a set of photos where the two appeared together and shared them in the news. When compiled, these photos told a story that caught everyone’s attention:
 

 
When Tong Zhao spoke with a microphone in hand, Shi Qianqiu was watching her intently. And when Shi Qianqiu, known for his mischievous comments, made his usual offbeat remarks, the usually composed Tong Zhao shot him a sideways glance—playful, teasing, and filled with a familiarity that spoke volumes.
 

 
Her beautiful, expressive eyes met his, revealing a connection outsiders couldn’t penetrate.
 

 
This was love, plain and simple!
 

 
The invited reporters, to their credit, didn’t sensationalize the photos. Instead, they subtly hinted at the exchange of glances between the two, encouraging netizens to comment and share their interpretations.
 

 
The buzz was nothing to be ashamed of.
 

 
Before the fans had time to get heartbroken, the company quickly issued an official statement, clarifying the previous secret meeting and explaining that they had met to discuss a movie collaboration, with no romantic intentions between the two at the moment.
 

 
The discussion among netizens was lively, with the scandal trending on social media, inevitably bringing up their collaborative movie.
 

 
Back and forth, this also saved a small chunk of the budget.
 

 
[I'm so anxious! Why hasn't it been released yet? The version shown at the screening was the edited one, right? I’m bound by a non-disclosure agreement, but I just want to see it now!]
 

 
[Someone, please knock me out with a punch so that when I wake up, I can watch ‘Neverland Girl’! qaq]
 

 
[Stop talking about it, the trailer's out! Everyone, hurry and go watch it! Check the homepage of the movie theater! Go watch it now!]
 

 
A week before the release, the carefully crafted trailer, riding on this wave of publicity, entered the sight of countless netizens.
# Chapter112
"I don't want to grow up."
 

 
"Then always be our little one. Stay with us and never leave."
 

 
The trailer begins with young Zhao curled up on her mother’s lap. Soft golden light from the setting sun filters through the window, enveloping the mother and daughter in a warm glow. Little Zhao's chubby, porcelain-like cheeks look as though they're draped in a layer of golden gauze, her bright, almond-shaped eyes reflecting crescent-shaped highlights.
 

 
The child version of Tong Zhao is one of the movie’s promotional highlights. Though her appearances in the film are brief, the trailer generously showcases her adorable moments. Usually, such childhood roles are portrayed by child actors, but even without promotional material, the familiar almond-shaped eyes, delicate features, and expressive brows make it clear—this is Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Who could have imagined young Tong Zhao would be this cute?
 

 
Is such an adorable child even real?
 

 
Miniature Tong Zhao looks like a meticulously crafted BJD doll, with her long, thick eyelashes framing her clear, bright eyes. Her slightly chubby cheeks, arms, and legs hint at a well-fed childhood, giving her a soft, clumsy charm.
 

 
Comment sections erupted, claiming these childhood scenes might be the only time audiences will see Tong Zhao with even a hint of baby fat—after all, she’s famous for her disciplined physique.
 

 
[I always imagined young Tong Zhao as a cold, noble young lady… Turns out she was this adorable? Rolling onto the play mat and tumbling over herself? I’m melting!]
 

 
[One of life’s great mysteries: How could that scumbag dad bear to hurt this angel of a child?]
 

 
[The scumbag dad can rot! From now on, we are all officially Tong Zhao's dad fans!]
 

 
[Your announcement is officially approved.]
 

 
The scene shifts to an exchange of messages between the male and female leads. When the camera focuses on Tong Zhao, the soundtrack features lighthearted piano notes, perfectly timed with each line of dialogue. However, when the focus shifts to Han Zhi, the music changes to deeper, more somber drum beats.
 

 
In visual storytelling, background music is an integral part of conveying emotion and narrative information.
 

 
On one side is unreserved sincerity, and on the other is a calculated probe cloaked in mystery.
 

 
—Is this the classic "bad boy and princess" trope?
 

 
The trailer’s editing subtly plants this idea in the audience's mind.
 

 
In the preview, Han Zhi sheds his usual refined style of button-ups, casual suits, and trench coats. Instead, his entrance features a trendy, rebellious outfit. His black hair, styled with a light mist of setting spray, is slightly tousled for an effortlessly cool look, with a strand of fringe falling over his left eye to accentuate his face shape. Whoever styled this deserves applause—they managed to transform a suave man in his late twenties into a smoldering “boy-next-door” in his early twenties. His playful smirk at the computer screen has female viewers collectively swooning.
 

 
"Damn, just for this look, I ‘have’ to see this in theaters!"
 

 
The trailer swiftly transitions into a montage explaining the plot's twist—accidental amnesia.
 

 
The heavy beats of a drum accompany a job posting seeking medical help as it spreads online. A mouse clicks, and the next scene reveals Han Zhi presenting himself formally to the female lead's parents. He's wearing silver-rimmed glasses, exuding a dependable yet subtly roguish charm—a "cultured bad boy" persona.
 

 
It’s a look audiences are familiar with, but the vibe is entirely different this time.
 
It’s mischievous. It’s magnetic.
 

 
—"You don’t remember me?"
 

 
—"I think I’ve dreamed of you… but it feels like I’m always dreaming now."
 

 
—"What’s your dream like?"
 

 
As Han Zhi gazes at Tong Zhao, the question drops. The camera zooms sharply into her clear, bright eyes, then quickly pans out to reveal a whimsical, dreamlike mansion, setting a surreal and magical tone.
 

 
"What’s it like to pamper your girlfriend into being a child?"
 
"I didn’t spoil her like this, thanks."
 

 
Though the white text claims, "I didn’t spoil her," the clips contradict him. Han Zhi is shown peeling an orange for her, adjusting her inner sleeve after helping her into her jacket, and more.
 

 
—"I’m not dating a bratty kid."
 

 
The music abruptly stops as Han Zhi twirls an automatic pencil between his fingers and lightly taps Tong Zhao on the forehead. Startled, she instinctively covers her head like a flustered little hamster, perfectly mirroring the earlier scene where young Zhao does the same. The identical expressions cleverly reinforce the "soul reverting to childhood" premise.
 

 
With a childlike mind, Tong Zhao forgets her online romance with Han Zhi but feels a strange sense of warmth and reliance on him. Often, she wonders who he really is. In essence, she falls for him all over again as a child—classic romance storytelling where, no matter the identity or timeline, love always finds a way.
 

 
Following a crescendo of fast-paced drum beats, two lines of text appear on screen:
 

 
"I never thought I'd become the reason a brat doesn't want to grow up."
 

 
As the final drumbeat fades, a recording plays the line, "But the one I love is Sylia." Tong Zhao clenches the recorder in her hand, rises, and rushes out to stop him from leaving.
 

 
The dreamlike mansion splits along the line of her body, transitioning back to its original, ordinary appearance.
 

 
Piece by piece, the fairytale dissolves into reality.
 

 
The female lead regains her memories.
 

 
The dream ends.
 

 
And the boy’s departure becomes the catalyst for the once-little girl who wanted to stay in "Neverland" forever to finally grow up.
 

 
The trailer didn’t reveal the ending.
 

 
Would the two protagonists reunite?
 

 
This question sparked heated debates in the comments section. Supporters of a happy ending argued persuasively that romance films no longer rely on tragic conclusions to draw tears; feel-good, happily-ever-after endings are now the norm.
 

 
On the other hand, proponents of a tragic ending also had a solid case:
 

 
[The director is Shi Qianqiu!]
 

 
Shi, nicknamed “Old Trickster,” is infamous for crafting stories that leave audiences bawling their eyes out—then allegedly hiding under a blanket to chuckle at their misery.
 

 
Of course, no one has actually witnessed him laughing under a blanket, but countless viewers traumatized by his previous works are firmly convinced of this legend.
 

 
The trailer was beautifully shot, exceeding all expectations. Combined with the breathtaking visuals of the lead actors, the comments section was flooded not just with plot discussions but also with girls tagging their boyfriends, dropping hints about wanting to watch it together.
 

 
The trailer’s share count stood out, thanks largely to Han Zhi’s fans driving up the numbers.
 

 
Tong Zhao has always discouraged her fans from becoming “data laborers.” She once posted on Weibo, asking them not to do this because it wasn’t necessary. She emphasized that there are many ways to express one’s support. While generating data isn’t illegal and doesn’t seem to harm anyone (aside from putting stress on Sina’s servers), she values her fans’ time and doesn’t want them wasting it on meaningless tasks.
 

 
Her stance has led to her having relatively “modest” data compared to her popularity. However, when it comes to "dehydrated" (authentic) engagement metrics, her numbers are consistently impressive—a fact widely recognized within the industry.
 

 
Interestingly, Han Zhi’s fans are usually laid-back and don’t engage in data wars either.
 

 
So why the exception this time?
 

 
—This was Han Zhi’s long-anticipated debut in a film!
 

 
Hints about his involvement had appeared during his previous live streams, though fans didn’t think he’d take on an acting role. They assumed it was related to Tong Zhao’s work, perhaps as a behind-the-scenes contribution. When word spread within the industry that Han Zhi would play the male lead, even notable film critics were skeptical.
 

 
But the trial screening turned out to be a surprising success!
 

 
When the trailer was released, it caused an uproar.
 

 
Fans treated it like a festive group activity, happily rallying together.
 

 
Once in a while, breaking their usual chill wasn’t embarrassing at all.
 

 
Many fans also wanted to make sure the company knew that Han Zhi still had active supporters. If opportunities like this arose again, they hoped their “Gege” would be considered. The shares were filled with heartfelt confessions:
 

 
[I’m so touched. Turns out the company hasn’t forgotten about Han Zhi.]
 

 
[Shoutout to my Brother—this self-love dynamic in the film is just chef’s kiss!]
 

 
[Self-love duo confirmed real (szd)]
 

 
[Han Zhi's new look—I’m in love! So youthful! Can this model be used in his livestreams? Someone write a petition for the wolf-boy version of Han Zhi!]
 

 
[Count me in for the petition. +1]
 

 
Since Han Zhi and Tong Zhao are essentially the same person, there’s no room for a real “couple” dynamic, which allows his girlfriend fans to swoon without any guilt.
 

 
The concept of one actor playing both male and female leads has been a trending topic, staying in the top six on social media for an extended period.
 

 
After all, it’s a first in the era of fully virtual films.
 

 
This level of buzz has other movies competing for attention turning green with envy. The movie has hit the ground running with immense popularity, and the related topics are flooded with praise. Fans debate whether Han Zhi and Tong Zhao have better chemistry or if it’s Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, reviving old rumors about the actress and director.
 

 
Don’t ask—when in doubt, ‘all ships are welcome in the harem’.
 

 
Other production teams have been tempted to replicate the success story of ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
But then they look at their directors’ faces…
 

 
Appearance is secondary. Most directors working on rival projects are already married with families. Any rumored entanglements with the lead actors would become scandals rather than buzz-worthy gossip. Lacking similar ingredients, they can only grit their teeth and grumble that Shi Qianqiu is shameless for creating hype by fueling relationship rumors.
 

 
That same day, Jiang Dang posted a short video on Weibo:
 

 
@JiangDangV:
 

 
‘Singing a song.’
 

 
[Video]
 

 
In the video, Jiang Dang plays a guitar and performs a seamless medley of three songs: ‘Obsession’, ‘I’m Fine’, and ‘Always So Quiet’. The selected lyrics include:
 

 
“My feelings for you are more than mere obsession.”
 
“I’m fine—after all, I’ve only ever been needed occasionally.”
 
“I’m fine—even in the cold, I only trust my coat.”
 
“It’s clearly a movie for three, but I never had a name.”
 

 
Jiang Dang’s raspy low voice delivered the melancholy lyrics as if he had experienced heartbreak a thousand times over.
 

 
The comments section exploded with questions:
 

 
[Did you just get dumped?]
 

 
Jiang Dang replied to one fan:
 

 
[Right on time.]
 

 
Right on time for what?
 

 
A quick glance at the timestamp: exactly midnight.
 

 
So that’s it—he’s just indulging in some classic ‘NetEase Cloud Depression’.
 

 
Similarly brooding is the production team behind ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, a romance film releasing at nearly the same time as ‘Neverland Girl’ and with a suspiciously similar theme.
 

 
Romantic films primarily target young couples, who often only watch one romance movie during a short timeframe. Once their demand is met, they’re unlikely to choose another unless the reviews are exceptional. Most will opt for a different genre entirely.
 

 
The overlapping release dates have caused no small amount of anxiety.
 

 
The most frustrated of all is ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ screenwriter Zhang Wenshi.
 

 
Zhang has been an old rival of Shi Qianqiu (though it’s a one-sided rivalry, as Shi doesn’t even remember who Zhang is). His grudge traces back to 'Heartless Tribulation’, a project that somehow also led him to harbor resentment toward Tong Zhao. In his frustration, Zhang once wrote a critique titled “Tong Zhao: A Distorted Product of Audiences’ Overvaluation of Subconscious Novelty in the Era of Virtual Films.”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even acknowledge his critique, let alone respond. Instead, she went on to shoot another critically and commercially successful action film, which Zhang perceived as a direct slap in the face (though Tong Zhao initially considered it but eventually forgot).
 

 
In short, with the release dates of his movie clashing with those of his two sworn rivals, Zhang Wenshi felt a mix of unease and determination to stage a comeback.
 

 
Fortunately, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had a decent budget, allowing for a strong promotional campaign.
 

 
In comparison, the competing production seemed a bit more frugal.
 

 
Zhang Wenshi thought back to how Shi Qianqiu’s movies were always known for their lavish spending. This, in his mind, was the biggest difference between them (again, a one-sided perception). After all, he didn’t have the same privileged background to support extravagant projects. Seeing that the rival production seemed underfunded, Zhang felt this might be his one and only chance to outshine Shi Qianqiu, and he was determined to seize it.
 

 
And Tong Zhao—she was still the villain on his personal blacklist!
 

 
With ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ pouring its heart into promotions, time seemed to fly, and soon, the day of its release arrived. The movie’s distributor had fought hard to secure an earlier launch, reasoning that even a one-day head start could give them an edge. After all, viewers who had already watched ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ might not feel like heading to the theater for another romance film.
 

 
All movie critics, box office predictors, and curious onlookers had their eyes glued to this holiday release window!
# Chapter113
Zhang Wenshi had everything planned out.
 

 
"Sweet Rendezvous" was set to premiere on Saturday, while "Neverland Girl" would follow on Sunday.
 

 
It was typical for couples, after a long workweek, to go on dates during the weekend. Watching a movie was a standard choice, wasn’t it? And "Sweet Rendezvous’" had solid production quality. It was a safe, conventional romance film designed to make audiences laugh, cry, and feel moved in all the right places. With a loyal fan base for the lead actors, many viewers were eagerly anticipating its release.
 

 
The male lead, Gu Zhisuo, was among the top-tier young actors of the moment. Debuting with a "cool and rebellious" persona, his role as the young heir in "Sweet Rendezvous" aligned perfectly with his public image.
 

 
Most people assumed this film would elevate Gu Zhisuo’s popularity and market value. After all, not everyone was as daring and adventurous as Tong Zhao, who chose projects that matched her unpredictable subconscious preferences. Gu Zhisuo played it safe and followed the traditional path to success.
 

 
The investors were cautious, but the "Sweet Rendezvous’" team felt confident. For a romance movie, they had invested heavily in production. They even managed to secure a slightly earlier release date, squeezing in ahead of "Neverland Girl".
 

 
Interestingly, though, while Gu Zhisuo’s team had worked hard to secure that early release, the team behind "Neverland Girl" seemed unbothered. Given Director Shi Qianqiu’s strong connections, not to mention his brother—a powerful and protective businessman—it would have been easy for them to push back. But instead, there was only silence.
 

 
Was it a lack of funds or sheer confidence?
 

 
Gu Zhisuo leaned toward the former.
 

 
When "Neverland Girl" was in its initial stages, Gu Zhisuo’s manager had reached out, expressing interest in the project. However, the producers implied that his asking price was too high. They didn’t explicitly say it, of course—such blunt negotiations could bruise egos—but the message was clear to anyone experienced in the industry. When Gu Zhisuo caught wind of this, he immediately lost interest.
 

 
Romance movies were a gamble when it came to box office success. "Neverland Girl" wasn’t some high-profile project aiming for awards—it was a small, scrappy production. His initial interest stemmed from Tong Zhao’s reputation for delivering box office hits, but not enough to lower his fee. Conveniently, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ offered a solid paycheck, so he took it instead. Given the overlapping release dates, he kept a casual eye on "Neverland Girl."
 

 
When he heard that the other production had received additional funding, he couldn’t help feeling slightly annoyed.
 

 
So they ‘did’ have the money—they just thought he wasn’t worth it?
 

 
Still, "Neverland Girl" had turned him down politely, and Gu Zhisuo wasn’t the type to hold a grudge over a missed deal. He had no intention of sabotaging their production.
 

 
However, hearing about ‘Neverland Girl’ additional funding stirred something in Gu Zhisuo. It wasn't outright anger, but more like a small thorn in his pride. Clearly, the issue wasn’t their inability to pay—it was that they didn’t think he was worth his fee.
 

 
Still, professionalism reigned. Gu Zhisuo had a solid reputation and wasn’t the type to stoop to petty antics over a declined offer. Instead, his focus remained on ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. With its superior budget, polished production, and early release, it seemed poised for success.
 

 
But curiosity lingered. ‘Neverland Girl’ had been quietly moving forward, and its lack of a flashy promotional campaign made it somewhat of an enigma. Gu Zhisuo couldn’t help but monitor its progress.
 

 
The day before ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ release, news broke about ‘Neverland Girl’ cast and themes trending online. A small corner of the entertainment industry buzzed about the film’s unique angle—Tong Zhao playing two lead roles, one male and one female. It was an unprecedented move in modern cinema, drawing immense interest.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo raised an eyebrow when he read the headlines. Was this what they’d poured their funding into? A dual-role gimmick?
 

 
His manager chimed in, sharing the same skepticism. “It’s a risky play. Romance movies usually stick to tried-and-true formulas. All this subconscious, dreamlike narrative stuff might alienate audiences. And let’s not forget Tong Zhao’s eccentric streak—she thrives on pushing boundaries, but it doesn’t always resonate.”
 

 
Gu Zhisuo nodded in agreement. “They’re betting on shock value, but safe storytelling is what wins hearts. Our film has broader appeal.”
 

 
Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the competition was creeping closer. He reassured himself with one comforting thought—’Sweet Rendezvous’ had secured the early release date.
 

 
That extra day could make all the difference.
 

 
For the production team of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, the weekend’s battle felt like a high-stakes game. All eyes were on Saturday. If audiences loved their film, they’d dominate the romantic genre slot, leaving ‘Neverland Girl’ with crumbs. If reception was lukewarm, the head start might not be enough to hold their ground.
 

 
Meanwhile, as the promotional campaigns hit full swing, moviegoers on social media began splitting into camps. Fans of Gu Zhisuo declared their loyalty, gushing over his on-screen charisma. Tong Zhao’s fan base remained quieter but deeply devoted, hyping up her daring choice to take on such a complex project.
 

 
By Friday night, hashtags for both films trended on Weibo. The stage was set for a cinematic showdown.
 

 
It wasn’t a grudge, not even a proper rivalry—just a small matter that Gu Zhisuo kept in mind. Secretly, he hoped ‘Neverland Girl’ wouldn’t perform as well as ‘Sweet Rendezvous’. That way, he could proudly spin the narrative into a story about his “sharp judgment,” his ability to “choose the right projects,” and proof that “he’s worth every penny.”
 

 
The early reviews for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ had been decent.
 

 
Screenwriter Zhang Wenshi, ever the tactician, analyzed the situation in their group chat, saying the two films were of similar quality. There was no need to downplay their own efforts or overly hype the competition. If both films had an equal 50/50 chance of success, their stronger financial backing would tip the scales in their favor when it came to marketing.
 

 
Gu Zhisuo liked this perspective. It reassured him that he had made the right choice—not that ‘Neverland Girl’ had rejected him, but rather that it didn’t deserve him.
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
“Fifty-fifty!”
 

 
These three words became a rallying cry for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, a confidence boost that carried them through the final days leading up to the premiere. Judging by the frequent mentions of “50/50” in their group chat, an outsider might have thought it was a fan group for a controversial livestreamer.
 

 
When ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ hit theaters, it delivered exactly what the team expected: a moderate success. The opening day’s box office just barely broke the 10-million mark—enough to recover costs and ensure a profit. However, with its Saturday release, this peak day would likely be the highest point of its earnings, and the numbers were expected to decline steadily after that.
 

 
Sunday would bring ‘Neverland Girl’ debut, and any hopes of a box office spike on Monday seemed unrealistic.
 

 
In recent years, for a romance movie to surpass 10 million on its first day was no small feat. For the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ team, this performance—paired with its stable 7/10 rating from critics—was a relief. Many of them had been worried that Tong Zhao, a box office powerhouse, would crush their movie entirely. Now, with a solid start under their belts, the cast and crew threw themselves even more enthusiastically into roadshows and promotional events.
 

 
There was even decent buzz surrounding the film. Several streamers hosted holographic “watch parties” for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, with enough participants to make a noticeable impact.
 

 
But then Sunday came.
 

 
And everything changed.
 

 
Here’s what started appearing across platforms:
 

 
- “[Movie Night with HaiYe] Neverland Girl Premiere Watch Party”
 

 
- “[Tsundere Princess’s Film Picks] Hmph, it’s not like I ‘want’ you to join me or anything!”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: For Those Who Know, You Know”
 

 
- “Neverland Girl: Exclusive Screening for Han Zhi Fans (Sorry, No Male Fans Allowed)”
 

 
At first, it was just a handful of streamers. But every refresh brought new watch party announcements, and soon, the first ten pages of trending streams were completely dominated by ‘Neverland Girl’. Even lesser-known streamers jumped on the bandwagon, eager to host synchronized screenings.
 

 
Holographic live streams worked as a ticketed event, meaning viewers paid to watch the movie while streamers earned a share of the tips and ad revenue. A significant portion of these earnings also went to the film studio.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, the number of live-streamed watch parties for a new movie often served as a reliable indicator of its popularity. And ‘Neverland Girl’? It was absolutely exploding.
 

 
The jokes and memes born from live streams often spread further and boost a movie’s popularity—a win-win commercial strategy.
 

 
Some fan group leaders even organized exclusive watch parties, requiring fan membership verification to join. This effectively created distinct fan spaces, where everyone could enjoy the movie their own way without interfering with others.
 

 
Even streamers who had been broadcasting unrelated content caught wind of the hype in the movie streaming zone. After investigating the buzz, many decided to join the trend. One of them was Hai Laoshi, a small-time streamer with the philosophy of “no shame in making money.” At the time, he was lazily streaming PUBG. However, when a friend mentioned the frenzy around ‘Neverland Girl’, he immediately tossed a grenade in-game to kill himself and exited the session:
 

 
“Hey everyone, I’ve been a loyal fan of Tong Zhao for ten years. I’ve been looking forward to this movie all week. If you don’t mind pitching in for a ticket, let’s watch it together!”
 

 
“After all, I was just streaming a shooting game, and Tong Zhao’s got great aim too. It’s all connected!”
 

 
[“Tong Zhao hasn’t even been in the industry for ten years.”]
 
[“How on earth is a romance film connected to shooting skills? This is the most hilariously shameless attempt at trend-jumping I’ve ever seen.”]
 
[“Classic Hai Laoshi—using his thick skin as bulletproof armor!”]
 

 
As a relatively obscure streamer, Hai Laoshi didn’t have many followers. This was precisely why he jumped on the hype train, hoping to gain some new viewers.
 

 
He quickly navigated to the movie streaming section, but to his dismay, the option to stream ‘Neverland Girl’, which had just been released that day, was grayed out.
 

 
Unconvinced, he clicked repeatedly.
 

 
Nothing happened.
 

 
“What the heck? Is the server down?”
 

 
This issue wasn’t unique to Hai Laoshi; similar problems were cropping up across the platform.
 

 
The platform’s response was swift. They issued a site-wide announcement: ‘Due to excessive demand, the large number of viewing rooms for ‘Neverland Girl’ has overwhelmed the servers. Streaming rooms for this movie are temporarily restricted to gold-level streamers or higher (current streams are not affected).
 

 
Creating a streaming room wasn’t difficult, and some users had specifically signed up as streamers just to host watch parties with their friends. This wasn’t an unprecedented occurrence. In the past, when highly anticipated blockbusters were released, the platform would preemptively set restrictions on streaming to prevent server overload, encouraging users to visit holographic cinemas for group viewings instead. For example, during the release of ‘Heartless Tribulation’, such measures had been implemented early on, avoiding any last-minute chaos.
 

 
But those were big-budget, effects-heavy blockbusters.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’, on the other hand, was an artistic romance film.
 

 
This level of demand? Unbelievable.
 

 
Hai Laoshi’s shocked expression was so over-the-top that one of his loyal fans recorded it. Later, it was included in a compilation of streamers reacting to the ‘Neverland Girl’ phenomenon. His exaggerated, near-eye-popping expression ended up earning him unexpected attention.
 

 
But that’s a story for another time.

# ‘Neverland Girl’ Faces Traffic Limits? The Largest Holographic Movie Platform Can't Handle It! #
 

 
No need to buy trending searches; the buzz is already here.
 

 
Aside from those who can go out to the theater with friends or lovers, and the regular moviegoers, there are also those who, on holidays, prefer to put on their holographic headsets and watch movies at home. These groups have all noticed the explosive popularity of ‘Neverland Girl’, which has become overwhelming. People are herd animals, so movies that are often both heavily criticized and praised by many tend to achieve good box office results through the same crowd mentality.
 

 
Bilibili video creators are complaining, Weibo’s homepage is filled with complaints, and coworkers, classmates, and friends are all trash-talking the movie—don’t you have to buy a ticket to see how bad it really is?
 

 
In this era of rising ticket prices, there are fewer films that use their bad reputation as a marketing tactic.
 

 
‘Neverland Girl’ has generated a lot of heat, but is it good or bad?
 

 
The first batch of viewers hasn’t even spoken out yet!
 

 
Before, critics were saying it was great.
 

 
But for the general public, no one really knows whether it's good or bad.
 

 
However, its popularity must have a reason. Moreover, it stars Tong Zhao... People who have seen her previous movies, TV shows, and variety shows know she’s good, so it shouldn’t be boring, right? With this fanbase and the buzz around ‘the first film in 'Instinctive Cinema’ history to feature a single actor playing all the lead roles*, countless viewers hopped on the bandwagon, leading even more people into the theaters.
 

 
By Sunday afternoon, its box office had already surpassed Saturday’s ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ for the entire day.
 

 
What’s even scarier is that on Sunday, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ saw a drastic drop in its box office, well below expectations. Normally, a slight drop on the second day is expected, and with Sunday’s factors, the most optimistic forecast would be a small increase. The ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew had still held onto their “50-50” hope, thinking a slight decline was acceptable.
 

 
A piece of bad news hit the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
Not only did it drop, but it plummeted.
 

 
It crashed straight into the water with no splash, and no one cared.
 

 
Aside from Gu Zhisu’s fans and a few viewers who saw ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ yesterday and liked it, everyone else was discussing ‘Neverland Girl’ dominance on the charts and the impressive feat of almost crashing the movie platform’s servers.
 

 
This Sunday was destined to be a black day for the ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ crew.
 

 
The days before the movie release should have been the harvest phase for the whole crew’s hard work—brushing ticket sales, sharing glowing reviews, and reading ratings on review sites… but since the box office stats came out this afternoon, the group chat went completely silent, as if everyone had died.
 

 
After a while, the director broke the silence:
 

 
[“Have you seen the box office?”]
 

 
[“Mm...”]
 

 
[“Sigh, it’s normal since the neighbor had the first day; if the reviews are good, we’ll be fine later. Our quality is still solid.”]
 

 
Although there were words of comfort, the overall atmosphere in the group was still downcast.
 

 
The assistant director thought of Gu Zhisu and @-ed him in the group, jokingly suggesting, [“There’s nothing we can do, maybe let Zhisu do some promotion?”]
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s salary made up a significant portion of the production costs.
 

 
The investors were counting on him to carry the box office.
 

 
After all, his data on Weibo was very high, and among the new generation of popular stars, he was considered one of the most capable. He could encourage his fans, saying that one ticket per person wasn’t enough; they could buy multiple tickets or even buy them as gifts for others.
 

 
Gu Zhisu: [“Of course, I’m already thinking of a Weibo post. [Sunglasses Cat Head nodding wildly.jpg]”]
 

 
With his guarantee, the atmosphere in the WeChat group began to pick up a bit…
 

 
That sunglasses cat head was quite cute.
 

 
However, Gu Zhisu, holding his phone, had a handsome face with sharp brows and bright eyes, but his expression was as dark as the bottom of a pot. His persona was that of a pampered young master, but right now, his face looked like that of a rich second generation who had cruised through life relying on his only-child status for twenty years, only to discover that the government had implemented a two-child policy, and his mother quickly got pregnant and gave birth to a younger brother.
 

 
He was distressed.
 

 
These people didn’t understand the life of a traffic star.
 

 
The core fanbase, who were the most willing to spend and would go to great lengths for him, had already done all of the above without needing his promotion. What did that mean? It meant that the box office he could carry was limited—no more than that, and squeezing more out would only be a drop in the bucket.
 

 
Gu Zhisu had nothing left to give.
 

 
But he couldn’t tell them the truth. All he could do was come up with a sensational Weibo post to stir up his fans and squeeze out whatever remaining value he could from his loyal followers...
 

 
A little while later, a heartfelt Weibo post was born.
 

 
@Gu Zhisu v:
 

 
On this special day, there are so many things I want to say to you. My manager always tells me that the more I talk, the more I get into trouble, that I should say less. But I don’t care about that! I’m Duan Jia’s young master who’s not afraid of anything, and I want more people to see me play Duan Xinghe.
 

 
He then commented on this post: [Did you see Duan Xinghe?]
 

 
Fans immediately broke down in tears.
 

 
[Yes, yes! I not only want to see it myself, but I want everyone to see the best Duan Xinghe in the world, my favorite Zhisu!]
 

 
[Baby, you were great, really! Don’t let the outside noise affect you, okay?]
 

 
[Third time watching ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, still want to recommend it to more people!]
 

 
In just an hour, the post had been shared over ten thousand times.
 

 
The number of shares on Weibo sharply contrasted with the slow growth of the movie’s box office.
 

 
Gu Zhisu’s fans had worked hard.
 

 
But there was only so much money to be squeezed from his fans. In the box office for instinctive films, the traffic seemed like beautiful bubbles. When the box office was good, fans could help boost it higher, but expecting them to turn mediocrity into something magical? That was impossible.
 

 
Gu Zhisu understood that as well.
 

 
The Weibo post mobilizing the fans to feel the pain was also his way of doing his part and leaving the rest to fate, not wanting the production team to think he was collecting money without delivering results.
 

 
...
 

 
When the fans saw their beloved star feeling down, they immediately took the initiative to do some reading comprehension to figure out why he was upset. The reason was easy to understand—the box office data was publicly available and could be checked at any time.
 

 
Once they checked, the already broken defenses were further shattered by the harsh reality.
 

 
How could the comparison be so brutal?
 

 
They couldn’t understand.
 

 
Sweet Rendezvous’s promotion was actually quite strong, so much so that fans rarely praised the official team.
 

 
It’s a miracle considering how often fans curse out the official team, company, or agents. Clearly, the promotion for ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ was heartfelt, with a heavy focus on Gu Zhisu, which greatly pleased his fans.
 

 
Why did the box office plummet so drastically on the second day?
 

 
Both Weibo and entertainment forums were buzzing with discussions.
 

 
The answer was simple.
 

 
Because ‘Neverland Girl’ exploded.
# Chapter114
The market is like a cake.
 

 
It’s not some fair and just “grandpa divides the pork” scenario where everyone gets an equal share. If someone takes a bigger slice, others inevitably get less. Films released during the same period are already competitors, especially if they’re in the same genre. Bad luck for one means good luck for the other. That’s why people say making a movie is like high-stakes gambling. If someone makes a decent film that scores a 60, but it comes out alongside a 90-point blockbuster, then too bad—audiences only have so much money to spend on movies. Once they’ve seen the higher-rated one, they likely won’t have the budget for the just-passable one.
 

 
Unless your film is so outstanding that it makes audiences dig deeper into their wallets for an additional ticket after watching the first one.
 

 
But ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ wasn’t good enough to expand the size of the cake.
 

 
Speaking of “grandpa divides the pork,” this seemingly fair and just idiom doesn’t actually include everyone—“everyone” usually excludes women and refers only to men. Life is full of visible and invisible competition. Everyone wants to win. From the investors and directors to the backstage crew of ‘Sweet Rendezvous’, when they looked at the success of their rivals, their collective thought was: ‘Why couldn’t we be the ones taking the entire cake for this genre?’
 

 
If given the choice, everyone wants to be the winner.
 

 
---
 

 
“Anyone here who’s seen both? Can you explain the difference? Is Tong Zhao really that good?”
 

 
Some observant viewers noticed that when people discuss ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ they tend to refer to it by its title. But when it comes to ‘Neverland Girl’ they directly say Tong Zhao’s name or simply call it “the five-character movie.”
 

 
Is it because the movie’s title is too clunky, or is it that Tong Zhao truly carries the entire film?
 

 
Perhaps both.
 

 
Either way, the five-character movie has been deeply branded with Tong Zhao’s name.
 

 
If it flops, her myth will fall. If it succeeds, her reputation will be further gilded.
 

 
Whenever Tong Zhao has a new movie, the focus of discussions—whether among audiences or the media—is always her.
 

 
At some point, Tong Zhao’s success became a matter of course. Perhaps because there’s no real comparison point anymore.
 

 
No one has such a uniquely diverse subconscious. Imagine if you had three different styles or personas, but none of them were charming, distinctive, or capable—what good would it do? But Tong Zhao is extraordinarily gifted. Every time she pulls out a new persona from the depths of her repertoire, it’s incredibly captivating.
 

 
How can I describe it?
 

 
In the realm of instinct-driven films, when others become successful, it’s like a gift from the heavens—a stroke of luck. But for Tong Zhao, it’s as if the heavens prepared a full-course meal of three dishes and a soup, chasing after her to feed her, stuffing her with food. ‘Eat, eat to your heart’s content! Once you’ve finished these three dishes, dessert is waiting for you. Don’t hold back—this feast is endless!’
 

 
---
 

 
"Actually, I think ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is pretty good. GZS is really unlucky."*
 

 
"Shocking my entire village—are same-genre movies this competitive now?"
 

 
[Uh, OP, don’t misuse new buzzwords you just learned. “Involution” isn’t the right term here.]
 

 
[Movies released at the same time are competitors, and for those in the same genre, it’s even more cutthroat—it’s survival of the fittest. Besides, wasn’t the four-character film more hyped before? Fans of that movie made a huge fuss, but in the end, it couldn’t compare to a single woman carrying the box office.]
 

 
[Please don’t drag GZS into this, thank you. Respect women, please. Our side has always respected senior figures and never claimed to surpass them.]
 

 
After all that discussion, the conclusion is...
 

 
The difference between the two movies lies in Tong Zhao.
 

 
It’s not just vague impressions either. If you break it down with data and discussions, the spotlight is always on Tong Zhao and director Han. That’s proof that she’s carrying the entire film. The fact that she played two roles in one movie also piqued audience curiosity—something they’ve rarely, if ever, seen before.
 

 
Audiences aren’t particularly profound or nuanced as a group. Sometimes, getting them to buy tickets is remarkably simple.
 

 
It could be the movie features a cruel, unprecedented torture scene left entirely uncut.
 

 
It could be a major star, usually burdened by their pristine idol image, baring it all—man or woman, doesn’t matter. Even if it’s just a glimpse of their backside, it might draw enough attention to crush same-genre competition.
 

 
Is it unfair competition when it comes to Tong Zhao?
 

 
Professional doctors have pointed out that what she does imposes a heavy burden on her brain. For most actors, finishing such instinct-driven films leaves them mentally drained for days. But for Tong Zhao, the effects might last even longer. Fans have expressed concern, with some angrily accusing her agency of overworking her for profits. The agency explained that Tong Zhao has undergone specialized brain training for these roles.
 

 
Other actors don’t require such training because they don’t have such diverse subconscious capabilities.
 

 
But this only proves one thing: Tong Zhao has worked hard.
 

 
Fairness aside, she ‘deserves’ her success.
 

 
---
 

 
Sunday’s premiere of ‘Neverland Girl’ was the peak of Tong Zhao’s praise.
 

 
Most of the first wave of viewers bought tickets solely because of her.
 

 
The remaining motivations were scattered: “Critics said it’s decent,” “Sunday’s my only day off,” or “The plot summary looks interesting.”
 

 
Of course, what happens next is anyone’s guess.
 

 
Many in the industry didn’t expect ‘ Neverland Girl’ to dominate so overwhelmingly, and some even started to feel a little sympathy for ‘Sweet Rendezvous.’
 

 
“Did ‘Neverland Girl' have any major promotional campaigns? Not really. I didn’t see Tong Zhao on any variety shows this month. Even the trailer—I only came across it online. That proves the film didn’t have much of a promotional budget. Its box office pressure was even lighter than ‘Sweet Rendezvous,’ simply because it had Tong Zhao. With her, they achieved low investment and high returns.”
 

 
“Never thought I’d see the day when Director Shi’s film was this strapped for cash.”
 

 
“Hahaha, but with such strong opening day box office numbers, surely they’ll start promoting it more? Who doesn’t want more money? I heard Tong Zhao fully funded this film herself. I can’t even imagine how much she’s making.”
 

 
“In the internet age, it’s all about creating buzz.”
 

 
“In comparison, ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ feels too plain. Even the male lead doesn’t have the same charisma as Han Zhi…”
 

 
The last comment, posted by a film critic on Weibo, struck a nerve with Gu Zhisu’s fans, nearly sparking an online argument.
 

 
Fortunately, the critic’s friends quickly pointed out that saying such things would be seen as “stepping on others” in today’s youth culture. It would provoke backlash, both by drawing hate toward Han Zhi and offending Gu Zhisu’s fans, leaving the critic with nothing but insults in return. Realizing this, the critic deleted the post almost immediately, preventing any major conflict.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, meanwhile, were oblivious to this drama—they were busy doing something more productive.
 

 
What exactly?
 

 
Urging the official ‘Neverland Girl’ social media account to step up their promotional efforts. They insisted the team start booking variety shows, stop slacking, and stop being stingy. After all, with such promising box office trends, the film was bound to make a huge profit.
 

 
If it were another film, fans might scold the production team for being so tightfisted and indifferent to their idol. But when it came to this movie, the tone was completely different.
 

 
Here’s the emotional journey of the fans:
 

 
First: “Stupid stingy team! Are you neglecting my precious baby? Treat Zhao Zhao and Director Han better!”
 

 
Then: “Wait a minute... the main investor ‘is’ my baby.”
 

 
Finally, the fans turned to humor and started making memes. A giant stick figure sprawled on the ground, begging the official account to put more effort into promotions. Beside it was a tiny stick figure with a pacifier in its mouth asking, “Snacks? What snacks are there to eat?”
 

 
Their cheerful attitude was so unusual it went viral. The meme-filled comment section became another hot topic of discussion.
 

 
Confused onlookers chimed in:
 

 
“This pacifier meme doesn’t match Tong Zhao’s image. Feels out of character. Wouldn’t it make more sense if Zhao Jie was holding a cigarette?”
 

 
Which other actress gives people the impression of puffing on a cigarette? The internet burst into laughter.
 

 
When first-day viewers saw the film, they added:
 

 
“Just watched Tong Zhao’s new movie. Sister Zhao has turned into Zhao Bao ( treasure or precious Zhao).”
 

 
Turned into Zhao Bao?
 

 
If you said Tong Zhao was dominating the screen, cutting down enemies left and right, audiences would be used to it. But if you said she became a childlike character in the movie—that’s something worth talking about.
 

 
By Sunday, audience reviews and impressions of the films gradually entered the public eye.
 

 
As more people watched the films, the number of discussion points grew.
 

 
Romance films typically target couples and female audiences. For example, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ marketed itself from the title onward, encouraging women to “bring your boyfriend for a sweet date.” In contrast, the title of the neighboring film (Neverland Girl) leaned into a more artsy and abstract vibe. Yet, despite its lack of overt appeal, the latter blew up—and with good reason.
 

 
If ‘Sweet Rendezvous’ is characterized by steadiness, ‘Neverland Girl’ is defined by boldness.
 

 
Once the film was officially released, some short clips inevitably began circulating online.
 

 
Although this technically counts as copyright infringement, the production team usually turns a blind eye. After all, to truly experience the immersive visuals and atmosphere, audiences still need to buy tickets for the holographic version. These leaked clips act as free publicity, saving the studio even more promotional expenses—much to their delight.
 

 
Interestingly, the focus of these viral clips was no longer solely on Tong Zhao but shifted to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
So, what’s the story here?
 

 
Under the dual pressure from both the movie’s fans and Tong Zhao’s fans, the production team finally agreed to appear on a talk show for promotional purposes.
 

 
And when they finally showed up, they went big, choosing the hottest and most tightly scheduled program of the moment, ‘Let’s Start Shooting!’
 

 
The show primarily invites stars with recent works to chat casually in a relaxed atmosphere. However, the title of the program has a different connotation in Cantonese, where "start shooting" (kaai pin) colloquially means “start a brawl.” Perhaps the name was fitting, as the host, Xue Yutang, was famous for his daring and sometimes provocative questions. Early on, some guests struggled to respond to his sharp commentary, occasionally finding themselves at a loss. Over time, only the most thick-skinned or playful celebrities dared to appear on the show, which in turn boosted its entertainment value immensely.
 

 
Once the ratings climbed, even those who initially avoided the show found themselves willing to participate.
 

 
The guests representing ‘ Neverland Girl' were Shi Qianqiu, Qian Rui, and Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Today, we have three guests, though calling it four wouldn’t be unreasonable,” Xue Yutang teased as he introduced them.
 

 
“In fact, if the budget had allowed for this episode to be filmed in holographic format, I would’ve loved to invite the mysterious fourth guest.”
 

 
He let out an exaggerated sigh.
 

 
The live audience began murmuring, already guessing who he was referring to. After all, Han Zhi’s name had recently resurged in popularity due to the film’s buzz, becoming a trending topic once again.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned toward a particular direction in the studio and declared, “Let’s give a warm welcome to ‘Neverland Girl’’s writer-director, the lead actors, and the art director!”
 

 
The four sat in a semicircle, with Xue Yutang reclining on a personal sofa. In the center was a decorative coffee table.
 

 
Xue Yutang introduced the two behind-the-scenes crew members first.
 

 
“Oh, and speaking of the lead actor,” Xue Yutang added with a playful smirk, “if I didn’t clarify, everyone might assume Director Shi *is* the male lead!”
 

 
Xue Yutang wasn’t wrong.
 

 
Some members of the live audience, unfamiliar with Shi Qianqiu, took one look at his strikingly handsome face and instinctively assumed he was just another fresh-faced actor they couldn’t recognize. When they learned he was the director, recognition started dawning on some of them, recalling related news stories—after all, Shi’s face had gone viral before for his infamous line: *"If you want me to act as the male lead, that’s a whole different price tag."*
 

 
Tong Zhao chimed in with a laugh: “Director Shi isn’t cheap. Our production couldn’t afford him.”
 

 
Her remark brought laughter from both the host and the live audience.
 

 
The film crew’s tight budget became one of the key talking points of this episode.
 

 
“Still, when it comes to looks, the male lead, Han Zhi, has the edge,” Xue Yutang quipped, gesturing toward the screen.
 

 
Immediately, a large screen displayed highlight clips of Han Zhi from the movie, focusing on his most captivating moments. One scene, in particular, stood out: Han Zhi and Sylia caught in the rain in a garden. His white shirt, soaked and clinging to his body, revealed a perfect outline of his muscles. The rain blurred his glasses, obscuring his eyes until he reached up, took them off, and stared intensely at the camera. The silence in the scene was heavy with unspoken desire, like an overwhelming flood of Alpha energy crashing over the audience.
 

 
It was breathtaking.
 

 
The female audience members began to stir, visibly excited.
 

 
Seizing the moment, Xue Yutang offered a brief introduction to Han Zhi’s character. Naturally, he pivoted to one of the audience’s burning questions about Tong Zhao’s performance: playing two characters. Teasing her, Xue encouraged her to try embodying Han Zhi’s aura on the spot.
 

 
In the post-Instinct Film era, acting in the traditional sense was rare. But since she had tapped into Han Zhi’s subconscious for the movie, Xue reasoned, surely she could replicate at least 60–70% of his charisma in real life, right?
 

 
This playful challenge had clearly been pre-approved by the crew.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll give it a shot,” Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
Xue Yutang pretended to ponder for a moment. “Han Zhi’s other role, Nie Su, is quite the schemer, right? Let’s have Tong Zhao play Nie Su charming someone for a change. Hmm, but where are we going to find a ‘younger sister’ for her to flirt with? Director Shi, could you help us out?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu responded flatly: “No.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him. “Come on, play along. We’re here to promote the movie.”
 

 
Qian Rui chimed in, backing her up: “Think about the promotional budget—doesn’t it suddenly seem worth it?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu frowned, feigning reluctance before sighing in defeat. “Fine.”
 

 
The show’s staff quickly brought out props. Following Tong Zhao’s instructions, they handed her a long black trench coat and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses. She tied her long hair back, while the staff placed a black wig on Shi Qianqiu’s head.
 

 
The wig wasn’t properly adjusted and looked noticeably fake, but Shi Qianqiu’s striking features still stood out. His pale complexion and refined facial structure gave him a distinctive, elegant beauty—almost like a classic Chinese painting come to life.
 

 
“You’re stunning,” Tong Zhao complimented.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a sidelong glance.
 

 
A simple glance would have been unremarkable, but Shi couldn’t resist spicing things up. Adding a touch of flair, his gaze carried a hint of playful mischief and a tinge of vulnerability, as if silently saying “Won’t you pity me?” The effect was captivating enough to make the audience momentarily forget about the cheap wig perched on his head.
 

 
Unexpectedly roped into this scenario, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh and called for Han Zhi to step in and play along.
 

 
Han Zhi: “...Wasn’t this supposed to be an interactive segment with a female guest from the audience?”
 

 
The idea of playing out a scene with another man left him reluctant, and he showed it plainly.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I think they said having Shi Qianqiu do it would be more effective. Just pretend he’s a girl!”
 

 
This made Han Zhi feel like a duck being herded onto a rack.
 

 
Not ‘that’ kind of duck.
 

 
The kind being forced into something against its will.
 

 
Despite his reservations, Han Zhi remained professional and slipped into the role of the primary persona. Onstage, he executed a suave sequence where he draped a trench coat over Shi Qianqiu’s shoulders, performing the classic “charming protector” move.
 

 
After wrapping the coat around him, Han Zhi paused, staring at him intently.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, slightly unnerved, asked, “What is it?”
 

 
Han Zhi let his gaze linger on Shi’s ear for a moment before answering:
 

 
"There’s snow on it."
 

 
With that, he reached out, as if to brush the imaginary snow away, his fingertip deliberately grazing the sensitive skin behind Shi’s ear.
 

 
Throughout the coat-draping part, Han Zhi had maintained a gentlemanly distance. Nobody had expected such a subtle yet provocative gesture to follow.
 

 
The fleeting touch was barely there, but the skin behind the ear was especially sensitive. Shi Qianqiu was completely unprepared and momentarily caught off guard by the move.
 

 
Looking at the audience, Han Zhi gave a charming smile and announced: “Alright, that’s the scene.”
 

 
Then he practically fled the stage, relinquishing the lead persona back to Tong Zhao as quickly as he could.
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she was greeted by the sight of Shi Qianqiu sitting there, staring at her in utter disbelief, as if his innocence had just been stolen.
# Chapter115
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't forget that expression—an odd mix of shock, disdain, and a hint of contemplation.
 

 
The two of them, being sharp and experienced, quickly remembered they were filming a show. With a smile still lingering on her face, Tong Zhao returned to her seat and casually remarked, "Something like that... If I had applied a proper full-face makeup, it would look even more like a guy."
 

 
The people on and off stage treated her words as modesty.
 

 
Xue Yutang shook his head repeatedly, clearly impressed. "No, that was amazing. The character switch just now—it really felt like there was a man’s soul hiding inside you. And not just any man, but a total player and heartbreaker." Known for his sharp tongue, Xue gave her high praise with an uncharacteristically genuine tone, showing how thoroughly impressed he was. "Even if it were still the era of traditional films, your acting alone would guarantee you’d be a star!"
 

 
It was truly astonishing. If not for Tong Zhao's star power and professionalism preventing the host from treating her like a mere spectacle, Xue Yutang might have even asked her to perform again.
 

 
The fact remained: she was still the same person.
 

 
She only added a trench coat, with no changes to her styling or features. She didn’t even pull any exaggerated expressions. It was clear she wasn’t the theatrical type. Yet, in just the blink of an eye, her aura had transformed. Her interactions with Shi Qianqiu were entirely different from when she portrayed her female self, leaving everyone in awe.
 

 
"It's as if a completely different soul has taken over," Xue Yutang exclaimed with a chuckle. "If you told me you could summon spirits, I’d believe it."
 

 
---
 

 
Dan Ge: "Han Zhi, forever a legend!"
 
Chen Guifei: "Hahaha, I can’t! Shi Qianqiu’s expression just now was absolutely priceless!"
 

 
Han Zhi felt like he’d taken some serious emotional damage.
 

 
He was tainted. He was no longer pure.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Shi Qianqiu and asked, “What was it like for you?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu pressed his temples and sighed dramatically, removing the wig in a way that evoked the tired resignation of a dancer removing her makeup after a grueling performance. “Promoting a movie is no joke… If the box office doesn’t shoot up by at least a hundred million, it’d be an insult to my worth.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smirked. “You certainly think highly of yourself.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gave her a fake smile. “Well, I’m pairing up with you for this, aren’t I? Your fans should at least do me the courtesy.”
 

 
“Would they really?” Xue Yutang cut in smoothly, teasing, “Should they start calling you ‘brother-in-law’ now?”
 

 
Recently, several celebrities had been exposed for having secret relationships, causing fan communities to implode under the weight of such revelations.
 

 
“It’s impossible. After watching the movie, they’d probably scold me for dating too young,” Tong Zhao joked. She then paused deliberately, pretending to realize something. “Wait, did I just spoil the plot?”
 

 
Qian Rui interjected at just the right moment, “It’s already mentioned in the synopsis, so it doesn’t count as a spoiler from Sister Zhao.”
 

 
Xue Yutang smoothed things over with a laugh, segueing into showing clips of Zhao Zai’s playful and clumsy moments on the big screen.
 

 
In the clip, Zhao Zai could be seen rolling, tripping, and smacking her head, only to freeze in stunned embarrassment before trying to escape back to her room. But Concubine Chen stopped her, dragged her back, and forced her to watch herself. It was almost as if the production team had a vendetta, carefully editing together every foolish moment: pouting over green peppers she didn’t want to eat, clutching a giant teddy bear in fear of the dark, sneaking into the male lead’s room at midnight...
 

 
The public humiliation left Zhao Zai looking like she’d been struck by lightning.
 

 
She couldn’t face the audience anymore!
 

 
She was officially the dumbest “Zai” on this street!
 

 
In the quick-transmigration arcs, Zhao Zai had always thought herself clever and heroic, successfully taming four future villains to the point they obeyed her like loyal disciples. They saw her as a future wife, but she viewed them like little brothers. Perhaps it was the first-person perspective that gave her the illusion of superiority. But now, watching herself from the third-person in this immersive film, she realized—
 

 
Good grief, she’d been a fool all along.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Zhao Zai spun in circles, mortified. Tong Zhao, amused, steered the conversation away as Xue Yutang praised her. “Adorable, definitely. But I didn’t expect Tong Zhao’s subconscious to have such an innocent side.”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because my previous roles gave off a tougher impression,” Tong Zhao replied thoughtfully. “But honestly, the female lead in my new movie has a tough side too. Comparatively, the male lead is actually the softer one.” She glanced at Shi Qianqiu. “Remember how we were rumored to have secret meetings? That was just us discussing the personalities of these two characters back then.”
 

 
“Exactly.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu picked up the thread effortlessly, returning to his usual composed demeanor. “One is strong because she’s pure; the other is gentle because he’s complicated. The most fascinating thing is how she can bring both characters to life. Sometimes, I seriously consider flipping her upside down and shaking her, just to see if I can shake out more interesting subconscious personalities.”
 

 
No one expected Shi Qianqiu to have such bold ambitions, nor that he’d be so unafraid of provoking fans.
 

 
Xue Yutang turned to Tong Zhao with a grin. “Are you afraid of him?”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed. “He can’t beat me. Who ties up who is still up for debate.”
 

 
“Watch your words,” Shi Qianqiu said, his scholarly fake smile perfectly in place. “I’d rather not see even more outrageous rumors about me trending online.”
 

 
At that moment, the director’s voice came in off-screen, gently reminding them, “Brother Xue, please treasure your show.”
 

 
That tone immediately reminded the young audience of the superadmin warnings issued to streamers who cross the line or share inappropriate content, urging them to "cherish your live stream." Laughter erupted across the scene.
 

 
Being the host of an interview show isn't easy. Asking questions that cross the line might offend the guests, but if the host is too cautious, worried about the guests' status, the audience will find it boring and stop watching, which is essentially sabotaging their own career. Before the show, Xue Yutang specifically asked both guests if there were any topics that should be avoided, so he could be more careful.
 

 
Both guests answered that there were no taboos and that anything could be discussed.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he decided not to bring up anything sensitive, and Xue Yutang immediately looked at Tong Zhao—currently the hottest rising star with an unmatched level of popularity—with newfound respect. He remembered hearing rumors from a previous food variety show that she had a tendency to be difficult and act aloof. But after meeting her in person, he realized it was all just gossip. She was very easygoing, and her rise to fame was well-deserved.
 

 
It wasn’t entirely a rumor though.


 
After all, the person appearing on the show was none other than the famous concubine.
 

 
The more beautiful someone is, the bigger their ego seems to be. Her airs were grand enough to match a lavish banquet.
 

 
As the atmosphere began to settle, Xue Yutang shifted to more in-depth questions.
 

 
He asked Tong Zhao about her experience with her first film investment, whether she encountered any interesting situations while collaborating with others, and how she got along with Shi Qianqiu. He also mentioned hearing that many male actors were rejected during the casting process and wondered if that was true.
 

 
These were all pieces of gossip the audience would be eager to hear.
 

 
Tong Zhao followed up, sharing a bit of gossip: “Because I had to portray the amnesia-stricken female lead, I needed to pull myself out of the filming process and switch to a completely different state of mind. During that time, the doctor advised me to take a break, so I went backstage and had afternoon tea with the crew.”
 

 
“And then?” Xue Yutang leaned forward, looking intrigued.
 

 
“When I was filming ‘Instinct’, I really got into the role, and my mindset was kind of like a child’s. I had discussed this with Director Shi beforehand. And then guess what happened? He came up to me and said…”
 

 
Tong Zhao mimicked Shi Qianqiu’s relaxed attitude, speaking with great seriousness:
 

 
“Do you know? There’s no such thing as Ultraman in this world.”
 

 
…
 

 
“It didn’t really work on her,” Shi Qianqiu said, shrugging. “When my little brother first started primary school, that line made him cry. He held onto that grievance for a whole week.”
 

 
Tong Zhao added, “He saw that Ultraman couldn’t hurt me, so he started talking about Santa Claus and made up a scary story. I wasn’t expecting it at all…”
 

 
She showed a slightly embarrassed expression as she recalled the moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu helped finish her story: “It scared her so much that she ended up hiccupping.”
 

 
The idea of Tong Zhao being scared to the point of hiccupping was hard to imagine at first. But after the recent clip of Zhao Zai aired, along with her soft and sweet smile, her gentle eyes that shone like precious jade, it was easy to imagine her having a cute and innocent aura. Looking back on the situation, Tong Zhao played along and puckered her lips as if she was embarrassed.
 

 
Usually, Sister Zhao presents herself as a cold and perfect image, but now, openly acting cute—what a hard worker!
 

 
As for the topic of the male lead in ‘Neverland Gir’, it was a very sensitive subject.
 

 
If the list of candidates were actually named, it would offend quite a large group of people.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't intend to take the lead in everything on her own, so she only confirmed that some friends had expressed interest, but none had actually reached the audition stage: “Jiang Dang is quite eager to collaborate with me again, and I’m also looking forward to it. I hope there will be another chance next time.” She mentioned a real name to add some intrigue and prevent the conversation from becoming too generic.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao had asked Jiang Dang for his opinion beforehand.
 

 
He said it didn’t matter.
 

 
After a while, he even texted her: "Do you want me to get my Weibo password back, post a few emotional posts to increase credibility? Would that give you more face?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "There’s no need."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I saw your manager bought a bunch of quick-acting heart-saving pills for Double 12, that’s probably your doing."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I'll take better care of him."
 

 
Later, as Tong Zhao was scrolling through her WeChat Moments, she saw a post from Jiang Dang’s manager, clearly upset, with a screenshot of a conversation. Jiang Dang had sent him a message saying, “[Drink more hot water].”
 

 
Drinking more hot water was one thing, but adding candles? The title of "Most Annoying Singer of the Year" was truly deserved.
 

 
When Xue Yutang mentioned one of Tong Zhao's rumored romantic interests, he immediately became energized. However, she didn’t let him drag the topic too deep. They subtly shifted the conversation back to the film, as the most discussed topic of ‘Heartless Tribulation' recently—apart from Tong Zhao—was its art direction.
 

 
People might start to feel resentful toward the film if they overhype her association with it.
 

 
Is it true that without Tong Zhao, the movie would be worthless?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t want others to evaluate her films that way.
 

 
The movie was the result of the hard work of many behind-the-scenes staff, and the audience had noticed that. All she needed to do was cooperate with the promotion and play the supporting role while others took the spotlight—though Shi Qianqiu didn’t care at all. He found it quite amusing and simply decided to credit her for his work as well. He wanted to witness the birth of the Thanos of the current film industry.
 

 
The art director, Qian Rui, hurried to clarify that he had only played a supportive role in adjusting things.
 

 
The aesthetic direction of the entire film was steered by Director Shi.
 

 
Xue Yutang sighed, “Your entire crew has such a childlike spirit.”
 

 
Qian Rui agreed, “Yes, Director Shi has so many cute ideas.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was clearly uncomfortable with that description and showed an expression of silent discontent.
 

 
Later, when the show aired, many viewers became interested in the handsome men and women and the visual spectacle shown in the trailers and movie clips. As more people watched ‘Neverland Girl’, the one-sided praise for Tong Zhao started to decrease. Not that no one was still praising her, but now people were talking more about the film's other merits.
 

 
However, no matter how much praise was heaped on others, it all inevitably circled back to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was impressive, and Tong Zhao, the one who invited him to be the director, was certainly no ordinary person. No one credited Xu Yiming for this achievement. The only thing Xu Yiming did well was handing the script to Tong Zhao.
 

 
She really is everywhere!

This particular episode of ‘Let's Start Filming’ had a particularly thick barrage of comments.
 

 
Just the segment where Tong Zhao, as the male lead of her new film, flirted with Shi Qianqiu resulted in countless memes flying across the screen.
 

 
[Life is hopeless.JPG], [I'm dirty.JPG], [Shi Qianqiu, full of charm.JPG]... It was hard to even find the complete set of memes, there were just too many. Netizens looked at this and thought, didn’t they say the two were rumored to be in a hot, romantic relationship? Why does it look like they can’t stand each other?
 

 
Then came the hilarious stories from the set.
 

 
[Shi the old thief, never acting human, scared my Zhao Bao to hiccup! Come out and take the beating!]
 

 
[Just send a knife in the mail and be done with it.]
 

 
[Oh my god, I can’t believe that such beautiful scenes from ‘Neverland Girl’ came from Shi the old thief. My mindset just shattered, I can’t accept that he has a beautiful soul!]
 

 
[No, his heart is still dark, he just has eyes that are good at spotting beauty…]
 

 
Tong Zhao herself thought her relationship with Shi Qianqiu was more like that of good buddies.
 

 
Even when they were on the show, the smell of romance and cheesy drama just didn’t exist.
 

 
But it was hard to fight against netizens who looked at her through a thick pink filter. They clipped the part where she flirted with Shi Qianqiu and added the recent popular TikTok song, “Did I just realize, you are my antidote––”
 

 
It was impressive.
 

 
They turned Shi Qianqiu’s incredulous expression into an atmosphere of bashfulness.
 

 
It wasn’t exactly making something out of nothing.
 

 
It was more like a maliciously fabricated, shipping-level kind of slander.
 

 
The short video was edited very well.
 

 
The video creator, clearly desperate for attention, thought to themselves, "The brave survive and the timid starve," and tagged Shi Qianqiu on Weibo, asking him how he felt about the level of editing.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu replied:
 

 
[If it gets over 500 shares, you’ll be going to jail.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu wasn’t actually angry, and the video creator knew how to play it cool. They pretended to back off and personally funded a promotion, offering 20 holographic ‘Neverland Girl' movie tickets in a lottery to fans, as a way of giving back. Shi Qianqiu then liked the post, essentially giving his silent approval.
 

 
Fans who followed the couple from the beginning and watched until the end pieced together the storyline, and the onlookers couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
 

 
The movie's box office performed well, but Director Shi didn’t take any royalties—nothing to do with him.
 

 
So why was he so invested in promoting it?
 

 
It seemed like he had his own motives, maybe a deep connection with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some said that even if he wasn’t taking a share of the profits, the director would still want his hard work to pay off.
 

 
But Shi Qianqiu had worked on many successful films with high box office earnings before, yet we had never seen him promote so enthusiastically. What was going on? Opinions were divided. The couple’s ship was sailing strong, and there were theories behind it. Whether it was Shi or Zhao, both were seen as successful people in the public’s eyes, and successful people surely did things with careful planning—every move had ten steps already figured out.
 

 
However, the truth was simple:
 

 
"Bro, what have you been up to lately? You never come home for dinner."
 

 
At the Shi household.
 

 
A young, handsome man with a receding hairline, his voice tinged with a hint of complaint, asked.
 

 
Shi Wan Dong had always been his older brother’s shadow when they were kids, and even now, though his admiration had changed, he still looked up to him. But now, his life had other priorities—managing the family business, and his deep relationship with his fiancée.
 

 
"Not much."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu naturally picked up a piece of green pepper—his least favorite—and put it into his brother's bowl: "Every time a new movie of mine is released, I have to do publicity. It'll settle down after a while. And what about you? Never bring your girlfriend over for dinner?"
 

 
"Don’t talk about Xuanxuan."
 

 
Even though he admired his older brother, Shi Wandong decided that before marriage, he would definitely keep his girlfriend out of sight—especially from his brother. He had noticed that his previous girlfriends, after meeting his older brother, mysteriously ended up liking him instead. Shi Qianqiu had never done anything to encourage it; the brothers just had different tastes in women, and perhaps it was simply destiny that his brother’s charm always overshadowed his own.
 

 
Shi Wandong changed the subject: "The movie is making money, but it won’t end up in your pocket."
 

 
That was true; the earnings didn’t go to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
"This is the first time I’ve worked on a movie with such a tight budget. Your brother is experiencing life firsthand, and it’s actually pretty interesting."
 

 
Shi Wandong understood.
 

 
"As long as you’re happy, big bro."
 

 
"Then what about Tong Zhao? Will I ever have a proper sister-in-law?"
 

 
"Don’t mention her. Her acting is actually quite good. The other day, she was pretending to be a man on the show. But when we were doing publicity, I kept thinking she should have gone into the men's restroom with me."
 

 
As Shi Qianqiu spoke, he absentmindedly rubbed his ear.
 

 
It was the same spot that Han Zhi had “harassed” him that day.
 

 
Shi Wandong looked at his older brother for a while and suddenly said, "Bro, I’m actually knowledgeable about the transgender community. I wouldn’t mind having a ‘spiritual’ male sister-in-law."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s response was to fill his brother’s bowl with a heap of green peppers.
 

 
*
 

 
A week after the movie’s release, the neighboring critics were lying down, ready to be ridiculed.
 

 
There was no ridicule, though.
 

 
Because no one was discussing it—everyone was talking about ‘Neverland Girl’.
 

 
Some people were saying that the female protagonist’s villa, designed by the famous director Shi, looked so magnificent and dreamy, almost like a castle. If only there were theme parks like Universal Studios in China, they would love to visit it in person.
 

 
Others said that Han Zhi’s portrayal of Nie Su was so captivating that it was a love-at-first-sight kind of performance.
 

 
"Stop pretending to be a liar, come be an old Baby’s little wolfdog. I’d be happy to take care of him."
 

 
Then there were those who were charmed by Tong Zhao, saying they never expected she had such a cute side to her.
 

 
A new group began to rise:
 

 
[Gathering of Tong Zhao's dad fans here!]
 

 
[Since Han Zhi modeled for the character, how about creating a long-term model for young Tong Zhao as well? I want to see more of her!]
 

 
Male fans calling for the “father’s approval” were immediately reprimanded by female fans defending Tong Zhao, telling them not to speak like that as it would bring bad influences to their beloved. The male fans thought about it and quickly changed their wording: [Tong Zhao’s mama loves you!]
 

 
Not long after, they were pointed out again: [Always talking about mama, mama, mama?]
 

 
Fine, let them call her “mama”!
 

 
Tong Zhao showed this to Zhao Zai, and everyone loved her.
 

 
Zhao Zai was initially very pleased, her face flushed, but soon she saw the “mama fans” commenting:
 

 
"Protect the world's cutest Zhao Zai!"
 

 
...
 

 
Zhao Zai pouted and quickly dashed back to her room to sulk.
 

 
[Congratulations, host! You’ve activated Zhao Zai’s passive skill: "The Group's Favorite Aura." From the elderly to children, there is no one who doesn’t like this little one! If the person holds no ill will towards the host, they’ll automatically have 40% favorability.]
 

 
40% favorability...
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s experience with quick transmigration, this meant that the person would unconsciously find her likable, wanting to care for her, but it wouldn’t be to the point of being madly infatuated.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought this might be useful for business and TV appearances, but she didn’t want to keep it active all the time. Still, she was a bit puzzled: [Didn’t Brother Zhi and Shuyi activate skills for me before?] She actually also wanted to say, “I didn’t know the system was still active.”
 

 
System: [Not activated.]
 

 
Tong Zhao guessed that perhaps there were some conditions she wasn’t aware of.
 

 
Now that life was going smoothly, she didn’t feel the need to turn herself into a jack-of-all-trades, an all-powerful “Thanos,” so she didn’t pursue any other skills.
 

 
For now, she was already quite capable.
 

 
After ‘Neverland Girl' had been out for about a month, the box office was raking in money at a crazy rate, eventually reaching a number that even a romance movie would never dare to dream of.
 

 
Two billion!
 

 
Next door, ‘Sweetness Rendezvous’ only earned a quarter of that, and it was still considered to have broken even—it's not considered a failure, after all. In the entire film industry, most movies end up losing money. It's often like the pharmaceutical industry developing new drugs; investors rely on the profitable projects to cover the losses, and if they make a profit by the end of the year, it's considered a success.
 

 
Films in the industry can lose money severely, but when they earn, they earn big.
 

 
This number is terrifying.
 

 
The industry was shocked. Could a romance movie really make that much money? After some post-analysis of the data, it turns out that there hadn’t been any high-quality romance films in the last six months. The industry turned to big-budget special effects films because they were considered more profitable. Shi Qianqiu came up with a perfect idea that combined both elements, filling the gap in the market.
 

 
Fans started doing the math, and after subtracting the costs and various other expenses, Tong Zhao had made quite a fortune from this. At the very least, the recent drama with her mortgage loan, once she gets this money, she could outright purchase a new house.
 

 
Other stars’ fans were a bit jealous, saying that the money was just too easy to make.
 

 
Entertainment forums often had industry professionals commenting, as the entire industry relied heavily on behind-the-scenes staff. They came out to break things down for the netizens:
 

 
The entire film industry’s earnings are like an upside-down pyramid: the hits make most of the box office revenue, while the flops sit at the bottom with no return.
 

 
If your idol wants to earn so much, they either need to use their own savings to invest in movies or be famous enough to directly negotiate a deal with the producers for a cut of the profits. Otherwise, forget about it.
 

 
At this point, a netizen commented in the thread:
 

 
[Stop, the tears can't be held back anymore. Let's not discuss her, TZ is truly one of a kind.]
 

 
[No, I love hearing this, don’t mind the delicate feelings, keep talking about the profit sharing.]
 

 
Soon after, other gossip-loving netizens moved on to different threads. Another hot topic was Tong Zhao’s father—
 

 
Every time she made money, there was always someone bringing up her scoundrel father.
 

 
What was he doing, anyway? Just bury him already.
 

 
Even if he’s buried, they’ll dig him up and whip his corpse.
 

 
Tong Zhenming was a well-known figure, and his recent situation was easy to find out—he had just sent his youngest daughter off to marry. He worked himself to the bone, scraping by to manage the company, and the net profit of the company might take ten years to equal what his eldest daughter earned from one movie.
 

 
No one knew what his feelings would be upon seeing the overwhelming praise for Tong Zhao all over the news and online.
 

 
The netizens guessed correctly—it probably felt worse than having his ancestor’s grave dug up.
 

 
The gossiping netizens were having a blast, continuously digging up and whipping his reputation, like a cruel revival of buried suffering. Meanwhile, Tong Zhao had completely forgotten to flaunt her success to him—it just wasn’t on her mind; she was too busy. With the film promotion winding down, she was now focused on handling a large sum of money that had come her way, looking for ways to make it grow.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s investment success had finally won over the film industry.
 

 
To put it this way, in the past, when Hong Kong films shot police and gangster movies, they’d pay respects to Guan Gong.
 

 
Now, when filmmakers in China make instinctive films, there are plenty who secretly offer a prayer to a photo of Tong Zhao, almost as if they wanted to present her with some gold ingots and candles, hoping to share in her good fortune.
 

 
Sister Chu brought over a pile of projects, hoping to let Tong Zhao choose.
 

 
Outsiders believed that someone as big as Tong Zhao should be living a life full of glamorous parties.
 

 
But not Tong Zhao. She stayed in her spacious flat, played by herself when she was tired, and when she wasn’t, she watched the stock market.
 

 
Recently, she had a feeling that another door in her mental palace was about to open.
 

 
As she was pondering this, her agent, Sister Chu, told her:
 

 
"Many variety shows want to invite you to make an appearance. Would you like to pick one to try out?”
# Chapter116
Tong Zhao was overwhelmed by the options.
 

 
The projects presented to her included not only invitations to appear as a short-term guest on popular existing variety shows but also concepts that hadn't yet begun production and were still in the idea phase. Sister Chu explained, "If you express even a slight interest, funding and production teams will immediately get to work. Just pick whatever you like."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Sister Chu added, "You can narrow it down to a few you’re interested in. If you’re unsure, I can take them back and discuss with the team to select the one that suits you best from all angles."
 

 
After all, handling these decisions was the job of her manager and team—to let the artist fully focus on their creative work.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded and began sifting through the variety show proposals.
 

 
There were so many that it was dizzying.
 

 
She first eliminated the survival-themed shows. After the wildly successful ‘One Life Survivor’ aired and revealed its rating data—a sharp V-shaped curve with a significant disparity between the episodes featuring Tong Zhao and those without her—similar survival programs began flooding her with invitations.
 

 
Since Duan Ge's grievances had been adequately vented during that program, leaving him calm for now, Tong Zhao had no plans to revisit that genre anytime soon.
 

 
As a result, she set aside a pile of invitations that guaranteed her center stage and heavily marketed the programs around her, not even bothering to glance at them.
 

 
There was ‘Quirky Stand-Up’, a comedy-based talk show.
 
‘New Era Talent Group’, a talent competition show, invited her as a special guest mentor and mystery star. Tong Zhao was somewhat interested in this one—since it was just a one-time appearance, she marked it with a star.
 
‘Cohabitation Era’, a program about celebrities experiencing rental life.
 

 
...
 

 
After excluding the food, travel, and entertainment-focused variety shows, Tong Zhao found herself with few programs that truly piqued her interest. Ultimately, she singled out a seven-day immersive reality show, ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
The highlight of the show was watching celebrities take care of children. The most entertaining aspect was the interaction between the stars and the adorable yet mischievous kids. The production team somehow managed to invite children with extraordinary backgrounds—half of them were second-generation kids of big-name stars, renowned singers, famous directors, and other influential figures.
 

 
The remaining kids, though not from celebrity families, often had unique characteristics due to their upbringing.
 

 
Rambunctious kids are already a handful, but these were not only someone else's children but also kids with powerful backgrounds. Even on an immersive reality show, no one dared truly scold them. One by one, young male idols and female stars were driven to the edge, turning chaos into high ratings for the show.
 

 
These second-generation toddlers were notoriously difficult to handle.
 

 
In real life, they might suppress their personalities, acting indifferent toward what they deemed “stupid adults.” But on this show, they were brimming with opinions, leaving their celebrity "siblings" speechless and helpless.
 

 
Obedience? Not a chance.
 

 
"Foolish adults!"
 

 
One of the audience's favorite segments involved the program inviting the children's real parents to watch a live broadcast of the antics. The show would then film their reactions and interview them about their thoughts.
 

 
Netizens dubbed this segment ‘The Public Trial Hour.’
 

 
As Tong Zhao read through the project details, the personalities in her mental palace had mixed opinions:
 

 
Consort Chen: "Pass. Seeing children irritates me."
 

 
Back in her ancient world, Consort Chen's focus was entirely on winning favor. Pregnancy meant ten months of being unable to seek favor and the inevitable ruin of one's figure, so she had taken every measure to avoid it. Early on, many concubines with children had flaunted their kids to provoke her, causing endless annoyance.
 

 
The mothers would make snide remarks while their children delivered unfiltered jabs with their innocent words.
 

 
Both the mother and child assumed Consort Chen wouldn’t stoop to picking a fight with a child.
 

 
However, Consort Chen had her maid slap the concubine across the face before pinching the little prince's chubby cheeks and lifting his face until he could no longer shout insults like "vile fox spirit." She asked coldly, “Does His Highness think I don’t discipline children?”
 

 
Indeed, Consort Chen didn’t physically punish children. Instead, she had the little prince’s cheeks turn red from the pinch, then ensured the Emperor removed his name from the list of outings like hunts and excursions. As a final touch, she doubled the boy’s homework assignments.

Duan Ge: "I don’t have much experience dealing with kids either."
 

 
Shuyi: "I’m not interested, but if Tong Zhao needs me, I can endure it."
 

 
Both Shuyi and Han Zhi agreed on this, while Lu Xianzhang decided to retreat into seclusion.
 

 
If Tong Zhao was to appear on a variety show, she pragmatically wanted to choose one with the highest viewership.
 

 
Though she had become a legendary box office hitmaker, Tong Zhao acknowledged that luck played a part. There was no need to always gamble on niche or unpopular projects that others avoided.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I’ll go alone for this one."
 

 
In her recovered memories, Tong Zhao couldn’t recall being particularly skilled at taking care of kids.
 

 
While she was absorbed in studying one of the proposals, Sister Chu peeked over her shoulder. “There’s a second page at the back. Aren’t you going to check it?”
 

 
“Oh, I forgot.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped to the second page.
 

 
Typically, the second page outlined the benefits and arrangements for the invited celebrity. For instance, the survival shows Tong Zhao had previously rejected detailed her role as either a dominant antagonist or a team leader. They even outlined specific scenarios designed to showcase her appeal and gain fans, with clear sincerity.
 

 
But when they reached the second page this time, both of them were stunned.

[Special Guest Role on ‘Baby Chaos’]
 

 
[The production team is impressed by Ms. Tong’s child model performance in ‘Neverland Girl’. They’d like to invite her to participate as a unique guest—disguised as a toddler named "Xiao Zhao" to join the group of children. Once in the immersive setting, all other participants’ memories of your real identity will be suppressed.]
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Is this even allowed?”
 

 
Sister Chu, recovering from her initial shock, laughed and said, “For others, no. But for you, absolutely. I remember now—they made a special childhood model for you in the movie, didn’t they? That adorable design won over a huge following. Tons of fans started calling you ‘Baby Zhao’ and wishing they could adopt you. They begged for you to perform a ‘return to childhood’ transformation.”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao mused silently—she wasn’t even old.
 

 
Hearing herself praised, the child version of Zhao, nicknamed “Baby Zhao,” peeked curiously from her mental palace. However, Consort Chen mercilessly pushed her back inside.
 

 
Before Tong Zhao could respond, Sister Chu stared at her head in amazement. “I don’t know how your brain works, Xiao Zhao. For most people, there’s always a slight disconnect between their holographic model and their real self—it feels awkward. But you? You can turn into a man or a child without the slightest sense of dissonance.”
 

 
“Is it really that awkward for others?”
 

 
“Of course.” Sister Chu shared an industry joke to explain.
 

 
Once, a male actor had a sudden whim and paid extra to a modeler, asking to add 5 cm to his holographic model.
 

 
The modeler asked, “Which part of you are we adding 5 cm to?”
 

 
The actor replied, “Can it be ‘everywhere’?”
 

 
The modeler said, “That’ll cost extra.”
 

 
In the end, the actor only increased his height by 5 cm.
 

 
But when filming began, he couldn’t handle it. His subconscious felt something was off everywhere, to the point where he started questioning the meaning of his existence. Ultimately, he had to pull his consciousness out and reshoot from scratch.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s eyes glimmered slightly as she listened to Sister Chu continue, “But don’t worry. There have been others with adaptability as strong as yours. Experts call this… something like ‘exceptionally wide brain capacity.’”
 

 
Wide brain capacity refers to individuals with extraordinarily high mental strength, according to the system’s perspective.
 

 
If the brain is seen as a bag, these people have massive bags capable of holding far more. However, to display the kind of dazzling and versatile abilities Tong Zhao has in immersive films, that bag must be filled with all kinds of rich life experiences. This isn’t something ordinary people can cultivate, and there’s no training school for it either.
 

 
Sister Chu explained all this to dispel any doubts Tong Zhao might have from hearing critics call her a “freak.”
 

 
Tong Zhao, unfazed, smirked faintly. “I’ll think it over and give my answer in three days.”
 

 
Sister Chu, ever confident in her decisions, simply told her to consider what type of film she’d want to do next.
 

 
Not much guidance there.
 

 
Tong Zhao noted the look of complete trust in Sister Chu’s eyes and thought, ‘At this rate, if I said I wanted to do a ridiculously melodramatic film about teenage heartbreak, with abortions and suicides, Sister Chu wouldn’t stop me either.’

In the mental palace:
 

 
Hearing Xiao Zhao being bullied by the Noble Consort, little Zhao puffed out her cheeks in frustration like a steamed bun. Meanwhile, the reclusive Lu Xianzhang, who had been pretending to meditate, emerged from his room and heroically sacrificed himself to distract the Noble Consort and draw her ire.
 

 
Xiao Zhao scurried behind Tong Zhao, her tiny legs moving quickly as she clung to her back, asking in a babyish voice, “Do lots of people really like me?”
 

 
“Yes, a lot of people say you’re adorable.”
 

 
And silly.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought privately.
 

 
“I heard that!” Xiao Zhao huffed.
 

 
“I’m sorry,” Tong Zhao replied. “I just didn’t expect I was like this as a child.”
 

 
Most people misunderstand what they were like as children. When their parents or elders reminisce about those days, they often look incredulous. Those with better family conditions might even have childhood videos, revealing moments they don’t remember at all.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so used to her calm, mature adult self that she’d assumed she’d always been that way.
 

 
Until she saw Xiao Zhao.
 

 
A walking, talking version of her younger self.
 

 
Xiao Zhao puffed up her cheeks indignantly. “I’m very calm and mature!”
 

 
“Mmhmm, sure,” Tong Zhao replied, patting her head. Her hair was soft and fine, like kitten fur. Little Zhao habitually nuzzled her hand, like a trusting little kitten-piglet. “So, do you want to go on the variety show as a little kid?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao nodded enthusiastically, as if her head were a bobblehead doll.
 

 
Afterward, she shyly twisted her fingers together and murmured, “I kind of want to play with the other kids...”
 

 
Tong Zhao suddenly understood.
 

 
Every time a person grows, they say goodbye to their former self.
 

 
After being deceived and devastated by that scumbag of a man, she had killed off the naïve girl who once gave everything without reservation.
 

 
In adulthood, Tong Zhao excelled in every world she entered. Every persona she activated thrived in its own way, so much so that others rarely noticed any differences. But Xiao Zhao was unique—she represented the self that hadn’t yet had the chance to grow up. Her opportunities to come out and play were few and far between.
 

 
Realizing this, Tong Zhao’s heart softened completely. She felt like an indulgent adult who had traveled back in time and was now spoiling her childhood self senseless.
 

 
“Alright, we’ll let a whole group of kids play with Xiao Zhao.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao beamed with joy and planted a happy kiss on her cheek.
 

 
From somewhere nearby, the Noble Consort spoke wistfully, “I want a group of handsome men to play with me too.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pretended not to hear, tidied up, and climbed into bed to sleep.
 

 
---
 

 
The director of ‘Baby Chaos’ was overjoyed to learn Tong Zhao had agreed to appear as a guest. After some discussion, they decided to keep her role as a “special kid participant” a secret to maximize the surprise effect when the episode aired. They only announced that Tong Zhao would be joining the show.
 

 
The program already had high viewership, but the announcement caused an uproar online.
 

 
[Tong Zhao is practically a baby herself. How can she take care of other babies? I’m worried, QAQ.]
 

 
The wave of “mom fans” hadn’t even subsided when another post gained traction:
 

 
[What do you mean, ‘baby’? Keep in mind that Sister Zhao has a martial arts background. I’m looking forward to her tearing into some bratty kids on the show!]
 

 
As discussions heated up, the official ‘Baby Chaos’ account dropped a bombshell:
 

 
> @BabyChaos: Announcing another guest, @Jiang Dang.
 

 
No one expected this—what a dream team!
 

 
Netizens were stunned.
 

 
Although ‘The Knives of the Maiden’ had wrapped up its theatrical run some time ago, people's perception of time regarding major internet events tends to be blurry. Besides, Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were essentially the same person, and Shi Qianqiu was the director—so in the eyes of fans, Tong Zhao’s most “official” on-screen couple was Jiang Dang.
 

 
This held true despite the fact that Tong Zhao’s boyfriend in the film was played by another actor.
 

 
However, it was Jiang Dang who reaped the CP (couple pairing) popularity benefits alongside Tong Zhao. It just goes to show how unpredictable things can be—artists who know how to stir the pot always end up benefiting.
 

 
[OMG, OMG! Can you imagine the two of them raising a kid together? A preview of their future family of three!]
 

 
[Are you sure the producers trust Jiang Dang with a kid? Let’s be real, if he doesn’t lose himself, it’ll already be a miracle.]
 

 
[Can Jiang Dang even survive without his assistant and manager? /doge emoji]
 

 
This wasn’t just blind trolling—he had a track record.
 

 
During a promotional event, Jiang Dang was allowed to take a short break. He decided to wander around nearby, only for his phone to get stolen. As he wandered aimlessly, he ended up getting lost. Eventually, he had to ask a passerby for help, and when they recognized him, a crowd quickly formed, three layers deep, all recording him on their phones and demanding a live rendition of one of his viral earworm songs.
 

 
Instead, all they captured was his pitiful, downcast expression as he stood there helpless.
 

 
A 6-foot-tall, handsome man, reduced to looking like a lost kindergarten boy. Netizens found it hysterical.
 

 
But just two weeks later, he released a new pop song about feeling like an outsider searching for his identity. The music video featured his brooding, indifferent aesthetic, which swept across the internet, erasing the “silly rich boy” image completely. The plan had worked flawlessly!
 

 
CP fans were ecstatic, seeing it as the ultimate fanservice.
 

 
Historically, ‘Baby Chaos’ had segments involving interactions between “parent” pairs. If the episode’s lineup of child guests wasn’t extensive, it wasn’t unusual for two celebrities to share the responsibility of caring for one child.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t the only ones causing a stir. Other netizens, just looking for drama, egged the show on:
 

 
[Pair up Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao to take care of a kid—that would be EPIC! Producers, don’t miss this chance!]
 

 
Meanwhile, both individual fanbases retreated to their own corners, firmly refusing to support any forced pairing.
 

 
The already popular show reached new heights of anticipation. The producers, delighted by the soaring buzz and skyrocketing search data, were over the moon.
 

 
When Tong Zhao heard the news, she was a little surprised, wondering if Jiang Dang had agreed to the show because of her.
 

 
The Noble Consort asked how she felt about it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, responded, “Don’t you already know exactly how I feel? I’m just surprised, that’s all.”
 

 
To be honest, she didn’t feel much of anything.
 

 
She neither disliked the idea of being linked with him nor felt flattered by it.
 

 
The former was because she had also used him once, leveraging his name as a shield when selecting the male lead for a film. The latter was because Jiang Dang was an enigmatic character. While he had made his feelings for her quite clear, he hadn’t lingered around or followed up, keeping a certain mystique.
 

 
Perhaps an artist’s version of “liking someone” is just this unpredictable.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t dwell on it.
 

 
What she didn’t expect was that less than an hour after the announcement was made on the official account, Jiang Dang sent her a message asking if they could grab a meal together.
 

 
A meal?
 

 
His message was a voice note. That distinctive, deep voice of his carried the invitation, making her ears tingle as if kissed by the wind. His tone was perfectly normal—neither overly formal nor casual—just a simple, straightforward question.
 

 
Blame it on his incredible voice.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt it was her own overthinking and responded with a voice message:
 

 
“Before or after filming? What are we eating? Ugh, ever since becoming a celebrity, even grabbing a meal with friends has become a challenge. But if we’re really doing this, we should pick a place with good privacy…”
 

 
The Noble Consort chimed in: “A handsome guy invites you to dinner, and you’re worried about what to eat and when to eat? You’re something else.”
 

 
Zhao Zai (Xiao Zai) peeked in curiously: “Then what should I be concerned about?”
 

 
The Noble Consort replied smugly: “You should check if it coincides with your cycle—”
 

 
“Hey! Why are you shoving me?”
 

 
To stop the Noble Consort from corrupting the child with inappropriate comments, the Immortal Master pulled her into his room.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t oblivious; she’d considered plenty.
 

 
A man and a woman dining alone—if it wasn’t for work, it definitely meant something.
 

 
Maybe it was her upbringing, but Tong Zhao was rather indifferent when it came to relationships.
 

 
During her time as the Noble Consort, she’d been at her peak in terms of liking men.
 

 
Now that she was back to being herself, surrounded by beautiful men and women alike, she found herself feeling indifferent toward anyone.
 

 
Recently, Jiang Dang hadn’t contacted her much. When he did, it was always proper and work-related. Tong Zhao suspected he might not mean anything by it.
 

 
But before she could overthink, Jiang Dang’s reply came almost immediately after her message was sent—three voice notes in quick succession:
 

 
“Anything is fine. I can work around your schedule.”
 

 
“Let’s eat whatever you feel like eating.”
 

 
“Friends grabbing a meal?”
 

 
The last one ended with a fleeting, low chuckle.
 

 
It sounded like he didn’t just want to be friends.
# Chapter117
Unconsciously, Tong Zhao raised her hand to scratch her ear.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s tone was perfectly normal—he wasn’t being overly flirty or calling her pet names. Yet that low, unhurried rhythm in his voice seemed to brush against her eardrums, leaving them tingling. This man didn’t need any extraordinary talent to be a singer. His natural musical gift was just icing on the cake. Even if he sat there with a guitar and hummed some out-of-tune melody, it would still be a soul-stirring serenade.
 

 
She was momentarily dazed when her phone suddenly rang.
 

 
The caller ID read: Jiang Dang.
 

 
Consort Chen: "I like him—if you like him too, you should go for it."
 

 
Shuyi chuckled: "You're just still bitter that Little Kai didn’t understand the situation last time and ended up helping his rival."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Tch."
 

 
Duan Ge: "Placing my bets now!"
 

 
Her inner consciousness had turned into a stock market of speculation.
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored them, steadied herself, and picked up the call. She greeted him with a simple "Hello." He got straight to the point.
 

 
"Sending messages back and forth might miss your reaction." His sentences were short and clipped, likely a habit from his singing career. Even in conversation, there was a rhythm, with light and heavy tones alternating naturally. "I wanted to call and talk to you," he added with a laugh, "because I couldn’t wait to hear your voice—it’s so pleasant."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled slightly. "How could I dare think my voice sounds good in front of you?"
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, "I thought about calling you on video, but that might not be appropriate."
 

 
Fair enough—it would have been a bit abrupt.
 

 
Tong Zhao found herself surprised at how socially adept he was.
 

 
Jiang Dang continued, "After this meal, we’ll count as friends. Next time, I’ll call you on video."
 

 
...
 

 
Well, now—was this a gradual progression tactic?
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing but wasn’t particularly averse to the idea of a video call. After all, he was a very attractive man, and she wasn’t the type to clam up in front of a camera.
 

 
"Sure, why not?"
 

 
She opened her calendar and shared six days she had available, leaving the choice up to him. When it came to deciding what to eat, she couldn’t make up her mind. Jiang Dang suggested coming over to her place and cooking for her.
 

 
"Do you cook?" she asked, genuinely surprised. Would he blow up her kitchen?
 

 
Jiang Dang reassured her, "I do. When I lack inspiration, I cook or do housework. Baking helps me calm my mind."
 

 
After a moment's thought, Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She was genuinely curious about what Jiang Dang could whip up in the kitchen. Judging by his current approach—actively pursuing her and showing sincerity—the goodwill he’d built up over time was enough for her to give him a chance to show off his skills. As for whether it was safe for the two of them to be alone, she figured if it came down to a fight, he’d be the one worrying about personal safety, not her.
 

 
They set the dinner date for three days before the filming of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
In the meantime, Tong Zhao, enjoying her vacation, leisurely played games at home.
 

 
For her fans, who had been eagerly waiting, she decided to open a livestream.
 

 
Previously, Tong Zhao had been too busy with work to play games with Wei Zekai. But now, when she logged in, she saw a string of new skin gift packs and a barrage full of lemon emojis. Some fans were envious of the gifts she had received, while others were jealous of Wei Zekai having the special "Zhao Zhao’s Friend" badge. They also wanted to send skins to Tong Zhao.
 

 
"Not for free, I have to carry him to rank up," Tong Zhao said with a smile as she and Wei Zekai played five rounds together, and as expected, they won all of them.
 

 
Afterward, some fans intentionally queued up against her. Some helped by giving her resources, while others maliciously stole her minions for experience. Tong Zhao was unfazed, playing calmly as always. However, Wei Zekai talked a lot in the voice chat.
 

 
"Let's end the stream here," Tong Zhao glanced at the bottom right corner of her screen. "I have a dinner appointment with a friend."
 

 
The barrage immediately flooded with questions asking who the friend was, male or female.
 

 
Some viewers joked that Wei Zekai was in danger.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was also watching Tong Zhao’s stream, noticed the comment and, looking puzzled, asked, "Why am I in danger?"
 

 
[Do you know who she’s having dinner with?]
 

 
"I don't know! What does it matter who she's having dinner with?" Wei Zekai replied, genuinely confused.
 

 
He and Tong Zhao had a very close relationship, but he didn’t think she needed to report to him about having dinner with someone else!
 

 
[Oh wow, didn’t expect Wei Zekai to have a mature side.]
 

 
[What do you know, this is the calmness of the main wife!]
 

 
It was indeed very calm.
 

 
Then, an SVIP user sent a barrage of colorful comments:
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu Shi Qianqiu]
 

 
……
 

 
"Tong Zhao, you’re having dinner with Shi Qianqiu???"
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned. "Huh?"
 

 
The barrage exploded in laughter.
 

 
This reminded viewers of a story:
 

 
Why would an old farmer, who is willing to donate one hundred acres of land and one million to the country, refuse to donate a cow? Because he actually has a cow.
 

 
Why is Wei Zekai so mature and generous?
 

 
Because he hasn't faced reality.
 

 
[He’s panicking, he’s panicking, he’s panicking!]
 

 
"What does this have to do with Shi Qianqiu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao, still puzzled, turned off the livestream.
 

 
When the livestream blacked out and everything went silent, the audience in the barrage got anxious and began calling for her not to end it, wanting to hear more. However, it was no use. Some viewers checked both of their game IDs, only to find that they were offline. Left halfway through the gossip, the audience resorted to chatting in the barrage, speculating that Wei Zekai seemed to have strong opinions about Director Shi Qianqiu and didn’t seem to like him.
 

 
[Isn't it normal to dislike the old thief Shi?]
 

 
[Yeah, didn’t you all see the interview for the movie premiere? Shi Qianqiu’s ending for Nie Su was so real, it felt like a social revenge story. I wish the authors I follow weren’t so heartless like him. I don’t want to see harsh reality; I just want to eat small sweet buns qwq]
 

 
[Honestly, I want to see a drama unfold.]
 

 
Some viewers even went to Weibo to ask Shi Qianqiu directly.
 

 
Some asked if it was true that he was having dinner with Tong Zhao, while others speculated that Wei Zekai might be jealous and wondered how he would respond.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu actually replied.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v: [The movie ‘Neverland Girl’ has finished screening.]
 

 
What does that mean?
 

 
They didn’t even ask about the movie. Was he replying to the wrong comment?
 

 
After reflecting, the viewers figured it out. Turns out, the previous rumors about him and Tong Zhao were just promotional stunts for the movie. Now that the movie was done, there was no need to make money off tickets, and the plastic CP had expired, no need to mention it anymore.
 

 
[Wow, what a realistic man.]
 

 
[Turns out, I’ve been supporting the wrong person.]
 

 
The viewers felt that Shi Qianqiu was cold and indifferent, while he probably just found all the drama amusing.
 

 
It was the middle of winter in China, and he’d taken a long vacation, heading to the southern hemisphere for a trip.
 

 
＊
 

 
After filming the music video in the snow, Jiang Dang worked non-stop for 36 hours. He didn’t sleep well on the plane either, and when he got off the flight, he felt dazed. Normally a bit slow, with a hat and mask on, only his deep, penetrating eyes were visible. His new assistant thought he was in a bad mood, so during the drive to his destination, the assistant didn’t speak to him and didn’t dare to play any music.
 

 
So sleepy...
 

 
It was about time for him to feel tired.
 

 
The director had made him retake so many shots to match the mood of the song. With his head leaning against the window, his cold eyes looked as if he were plotting something bad, but in reality, he was about to doze off.
 

 
“If you're tired, Brother Dong, you can take a nap. I drive very steadily,” the assistant kindly suggested.
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head. “I’m too awake to sleep.”
 

 
The assistant, seeing his heavy eyelids in the rearview mirror, felt like he was redefining what "awake" meant.
 

 
Thinking about finally seeing Tong Zhao soon, Jiang Dang immediately felt awake again.
 

 
He propped his eyelids up and, to stay alert, lightly hummed a song.
 

 
After a while, the assistant, a little embarrassed, interrupted him. “Brother, your singing is so good and so moving, but if you keep singing, I’m going to get sleepy too.”
 

 
The driver definitely couldn’t fall asleep.
 

 
Jiang Dang was always easygoing, and immediately switched to a new song, softly and mournfully improvising a rearranged version of ‘I Come From the Grassland’. The new assistant almost had a mental breakdown listening to it.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Do you think it sounds good?"
 

 
Assistant: "Yeah... it sounds good..."
 

 
"How specifically does it sound good?"
 

 
"It’s very... grassland-y, bro."
 

 
Basically, it’s very grassy.
 

 
Jiang Dang laughed, singing all the way to the ‘Yu Long Xuan’ (a place). He switched to a song from ‘Initial D’ halfway through—’Drift’—and got the assistant so hyped up that the car sped up significantly. Only when they reached Yu Long Xuan and saw the security guard who was nearly two meters tall did the assistant finally calm down.
 

 
After dropping the assistant off, Jiang Dang entered the elevator that went directly to his unit and entered the code.
 

 
The elevator was very quiet, except for his heartbeat, which felt loud.
 

 
Thump, thump, thump, thump...
 

 
He raised a hand to his chest, trying to get it to beat in rhythm.
 

 
But the heartbeat didn’t follow his will, and even top-tier singers couldn’t control it. The "god of song" failed. The elevator made a "ding" sound as the door opened. Jiang Dang thought about his earlier actions and suddenly found it a bit amusing, curling his lips into a slight smile.
 

 
When he entered the community, Tong Zhao received the message. As soon as the elevator door opened, she went to the hallway to greet him.
 

 
"You’re here."
 

 
His mask covered the lower half of his face, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see his smile, only a pair of eyes that looked dangerously charming. For a moment, she thought he was going to push her against the wall and kiss her...
 

 
Of course, that didn’t happen.
 

 
Jiang Dang swiftly removed his hat and mask, his eyes shining brightly as he looked at her.
 

 
He took a step forward... then another...
 

 
And then, he knelt down.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "...Huh?"
 

 
What is he doing?!
 

 
Why is he giving such a huge gesture for no reason?
 

 
She would have been less surprised if he had pushed her against the wall and kissed her.
 

 
Jiang Dang supported himself against the wall, his voice faint but tinged with a hint of grievance: "I’m so tired..."
 

 
He had been holding it together, but once he saw Tong Zhao, the excitement that had been keeping him going just broke, and his legs went soft. Tong Zhao helped him to the sofa, poured him a cup of warm water, and when she placed it on the coffee table, she realized he had already fallen asleep, his eyelashes casting a small, fan-shaped shadow. He looked like the villainous final boss in a mobile game, even sleeping like a bad guy.
 

 
Jiang Dang’s schedule was easy to check. Tong Zhao asked his agent a couple of questions and soon found out that he had been running himself ragged.
 

 
During the promotional tour for ‘The Knives of the Maiden’, Jiang Dang was always the one who loved sleep the most. His sleep time was squeezed by the busy promotional schedule, and he always looked gloomy with a heavy, low-pressure mood. However, he never took out his frustration on anyone and obediently followed the schedule.
 

 
Tong Zhao stood by the sofa for a moment, thinking, then decided to carry him to the guest room, tuck him in, turn off the lights, and go to the study to continue her meditation and training.
 

 
Jiang Dang slept all the way through until the next morning.
 

 
When he woke up in an unfamiliar environment, he was initially disoriented, unsure of where or when he was. After a moment, he regained his bearings and accepted his confusion calmly. After washing up in the guest room's private bathroom, he slowly walked out to the living room, where he saw Tong Zhao using the treadmill by the floor-to-ceiling window. He greeted her:
 

 
"Have you had breakfast? If not, I’ll go make it."
 

 
Jiang Dang hadn’t forgotten that his purpose for coming was to have a meal together.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded, pointing him toward the open kitchen.
 

 
Bathing in the morning sunlight, Tong Zhao was dressed in tight workout clothes that accentuated her graceful figure. Jiang Dang didn’t look at her much and went straight to the kitchen, as though he was really just there to cook.
 

 
The fridge was well-stocked with ingredients.
 

 
Tong Zhao ran with her back to the room, listening to the rhythmic sounds of Jiang Dang preparing food: chopping on the cutting board, turning on the stove, pouring oil, and stir-frying. Everything was organized and orderly. Even though she didn’t look back, Tong Zhao believed that he really knew how to cook.
 

 
Even if his cooking skills were average, she would pretend it tasted delicious, considering the effort he put in.
 

 
After finishing her workout, Tong Zhao took a shower and changed clothes. When she came out, she saw the table full of prepared dishes. They weren’t necessarily gourmet, but they looked decent. To her surprise, they tasted quite normal—just like a home-cooked breakfast.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "I don’t usually make dishes like this."
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: "Seems like you really enjoy cooking."
 

 
"I do," he replied.
 

 
When it came to the incident where he had gotten so tired he kneeled last night, Jiang Dang just said straight out: "On the plane and in the car, I kept thinking about seeing you next. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. Then, when I finally saw you, I was so happy that my mind went blank and I almost blacked out."
 

 
He sighed: "These dishes don’t even showcase my cooking skills..."
 

 
Tong Zhao became more interested when she heard this. Since she had nothing else to do all day, she didn’t mind waiting for another meal later.
 

 
Jiang Dang, hearing her interest, laughed and happily said he would make her lunch.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao thought about it, she could only say that trouble came from her own words.
 

 
After breakfast, they played some games in the game room. Jiang Dang wasn’t good at shooting games. When they played ‘PUBG’, he would randomly wander off, fall behind, and get distracted by collecting trash. Tong Zhao told him not to bother with the useless stuff, but he kept promising and then died in strange places. After that, she went over to rummage through his loot box—
 

 
Turns out, it was full of garbage.
 

 
Compared to his terrible ‘PUBG’ skills, Jiang Dang was much better at playing the support role in ‘MOBA’ games. Not only did he have great map awareness, but he could also execute perfect team fights in the most bizarre ways, outsmarting the enemy with ease.
 

 
Tong Zhao observed for a while and noticed that his hero pool in ‘Honor of Kings’ included Lu Ban Master, Guiguzi, and Da Qiao. In ‘League of Legends’, it was Thresh, Bard, and Rakan—all heroes that, when played well, could carry the game, but when played poorly, could end up helping the enemy team instead. As she played, she did a psychological profile of him in her head.
 

 
He was a support player with a lot of creativity and imagination. He seemed clueless and naive, but in reality, he had strong control and aggression. As soon as the enemy made a small positioning mistake, he would seize the opportunity to deal a lot of damage. After he wore them down, the enemy's support and ADC would be completely suppressed, unable to do anything for the rest of the match.
 

 
Some people had already lost the lane, but the game didn’t really end until the crystal exploded.
 

 
He needed to control the situation, especially wanting to set the pace of the game.
 

 
He also liked to silently taunt the opponents, flashing emotes or signs to annoy them.
 

 
The more she watched, the more she felt that he resembled an animal.
 

 
When she saw him play a support hero and toy with the enemy's low-health carry, giving them hope and then delivering the finishing blow, followed by an emote on the enemy’s corpse, she finally remembered what kind of animal he reminded her of—
 

 
It was an orca!
 

 
Seemingly cute and clumsy, but actually very ruthless and loves to play with its prey.
 

 
With a single flick of its tail, it knocks out a seal, waits for it to wake up, then slaps it again and swallows it like a pancake.
 

 
The enemy ADC was furious, thinking he was a female player since he was playing Janna, a female champion, and called him a "bitch."
 

 
[Everyone] Jungle, do something! (Storm Spirit): *Whining sound*
 

 
...
 

 
How annoying!
 

 
That's right, orcas also make a whining sound.
 

 
After playing for three hours, Jiang Dang said he was going to prepare food. Tong Zhao was a little confused about why it would take so long to prepare a meal, but she didn’t stop him. She nodded and went to the study to work on the script. Even just reading the synopses of all the scripts Sister Chu had given her would take a long time.
 

 
...
 

 
"The meal is ready.”
 

 
With breakfast as a prelude, Tong Zhao felt fairly confident about Jiang Dang's cooking.
 

 
When she saw the dishes on the table, she was a bit surprised.
 

 
It was clear that Jiang Dang had put in some serious effort. The dishes were elegantly presented on large porcelain plates, aiming for the look of a Michelin-star restaurant.
 

 
She smiled and sat down. "You're really good at cooking."
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up a small tomato that looked like an appetizer.
 

 
When she bit into it, something felt off.
 

 
The inside of the tomato had been hollowed out and filled with meat juice and king oyster mushrooms. The combination achieved a balance of sweet and sour on the outside, and savory on the inside. The skin was cool, while the filling was hot.
 

 
Next, she ate what appeared to be a pie.
 

 
The jelly-like substance on the pie crust was transparent, but when it entered her mouth, it was unmistakably mango-flavored.
 

 
Finally, Tong Zhao thought the pasta was the main course, but it was actually made of chocolate.
 

 
And there was a sunny-side-up egg.
 

 
You'd think it was an egg, right?
 

 
No, the yolk was made of mango, and the egg white was specially treated cream.
 

 
Jiang Dang rested his chin on his hand, staring at her intently with his beautifully expressive eyes, not even blinking, full of anticipation. Tong Zhao knew how much effort had gone into preparing these unusual dishes, so out of courtesy, she ate everything.
 

 
To be honest, it wasn’t bad.
 

 
But after finishing this meal, the trust between people had clearly been shattered.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked her for her thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave her review: "Seeing the mountain isn’t seeing the mountain, seeing the water isn’t seeing the water."
 

 
Jiang Dang took it as a compliment, his eyes narrowing as he smiled, looking inexplicably happy, as if he was about to make a pleased "whining" sound…
 

 
Wait, she really did make him sound like an orca.
 

 
After the meal, Tong Zhao thought he would say something, but he didn’t.
 

 
She told him to just put the dirty dishes in the kitchen; there would be a cleaner coming regularly to take care of it.
 

 
Tong Zhao had all kinds of musical instruments at home. Jiang Dang performed a personal concert for her, then said he had to go for another engagement, leaving without doing or saying anything else.
 

 
The song he sang was quite nice, with a catchy, slightly addictive melody.
 

 
She wanted to download it, but couldn't find it online.
 

 
Two days later, Jiang Dang's official company-managed account posted a snippet from one of his new album singles for listening, and it was the exact same song he had sung for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The comments were full of praise: "Wow, so dedicated! He remembered to release a song before going on the variety show, a brand-new single we've never heard before!"
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had already heard it two days ago.
 

 
@Jiang Dangv: "Encrypted Love”
 

 
---
 

 
On the third day, after enjoying a relaxing break, Tong Zhao packed up and headed to the filming location.
 

 
Zhao Zai was quite excited, running around in the palace of her consciousness.
 

 
This made Consort Chen a bit annoyed, so she suggested, "Why don't I take over? I won't play the child, I'll play the parent. I could steal away all the fathers and give the children a brand-new stepmother."
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "I advise the Consort to be kind."
 

 
Zhao Zai was so anxious that she slapped her knee.
 

 
Consort Chen was joking, and Tong Zhao didn’t take it seriously. The production team had used her childhood modeling from ‘Neverland Girl’, and after placing Zhao Zai into the main personality’s role, she closed her eyes.
 

 
Her consciousness sank deep into a very profound place.
# Chapter118
"Baby Chaos" is a live-streamed variety show based on instincts.
 

 
After all the guests’ consciousness enters the modeling of the holographic space, the live broadcast from the outside world also enters its countdown phase.
 

 
The host introduces the big guest of this episode.
 

 
Jiang Dang was given a lot of attention in the promotional materials.
 

 
After all, in recent years, whenever he releases a song, it becomes a hit. His songs are heard everywhere, on the streets and alleys, and also on platforms like Kuaishou and Douyin.
 

 
The funniest part is that some listeners look down on him, thinking that all his songs are just catchy pop tunes, calling them overly commercial. They think that an original musician named "Si Bian" is the real artist with true aspirations... But just before New Year's Eve, it was revealed that Si Bian's account was actually Jiang Dang's alternate account, where he posted niche, experimental music that was hard to recognize at first due to the subtle tuning of his voice.
 

 
He has the face of an idol, but does the work of a pure creative artist.
 

 
[With a fanbase like his, it might be better to put him in the small guest category. I’m really worried about him taking care of the kid…]
 

 
[Fortunately, it's an instinctive variety show, so even if things aren’t handled perfectly, nothing major will happen.]
 

 
[Your song "Encrypted Love Words" went viral on Douyin again. I get on the subway for work, and someone is blasting it over the speakers. It actually sounds pretty good.]
 

 
The second guest, Zhang Shi, is subconsciously seen in the industry as the "honest guy professional." Many viewers, when they see his face, immediately think his wife has either already cheated on him or is about to. He’s been labeled as someone born to wear the “green hat” (a Chinese metaphor for being cheated on)—
 

 
No one likes to hear such evaluations, but because of this unremarkable feature, he has gained many performance opportunities, standing out among the "honest guys," and earned his first pot of gold. Therefore, he often says that he doesn’t mind.
 

 
At the age of 35, Zhang Shi is still single.
 

 
There are rumors in the industry that when he was filming an instinctive movie, after repeatedly being "cheated on," he was unable to approach relationships anymore. In fact, this is true. He has sought help from professional psychologists, and the doctor suggested that since this has affected the trajectory of his life, he should switch to a different kind of role.
 

 
However, in the projects that invited him, playing the “honest guy” is the highest-paying role.
 

 
Between money and marriage, Zhang Shi, who still harbors lingering fears about the latter, decisively transformed his sorrow and anger into strength, walking further and further down the "honest guy" path. The gimmick for this appearance on the show was also "This might be the only chance for the audience to see Zhang Shi taking care of a child," and the most popular comment on that Weibo post was—
 

 
[So, he's not even taking care of his own kid?]
 

 
That comment went viral and was liked until next year.
 

 
The third guest, female artist Long Fei, is always full of energy. Her team has her show up in grand fashion at every event. Her flaw has always been overdoing it—she tries too hard to outshine everyone else. For this show, she even had a press release claiming she was going to compete with Tong Zhao in terms of looks.
 

 
The fourth guest, Xie Zihan, is interesting. She’s a trainee who came from a talent show. After debuting at a high rank, she immediately felt a huge sense of disparity. During the competition, she already felt the intense competition, but after debuting and competing in the entire entertainment industry, she immediately realized how cruel and unfair life could be. She then obediently followed the company's orders, listened closely to her manager, and because her face resembled Tong Zhao’s to some degree, and she was especially good at sports, being surprisingly strong and agile among female idols, the press started calling her “Little Tong Zhao.”
 

 
In fact, the two have some background.
 

 
Xie Zihan debuted through the talent show "Star Selection Girls," the same season as Xu Zhu.
 

 
Her manager put a lot of effort into arranging this appearance on the show, hoping she could ride on Tong Zhao’s popularity.
 

 
"Fifth guest, Ye Fanxiao, from 'Dancing Youth Team,' who previously starred in a campus superpower-themed instinctive TV drama…"
 

 
The introduction continued for a while.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao, like Xie Zihan, also debuted through a talent show.
 

 
However, he was luckier. After debuting, he landed a role in a supernatural idol drama. Although due to limited funding, they chose a much cheaper traditional drama, it still gained some attention in a small scope. After all, the short clips from the drama that were widely shared on Weibo couldn't have been all holographic.
 

 
With the support of his fans, Ye Fanxiao landed a role in a relatively high-investment instinctive movie. Though not the lead, he played the second male lead. The movie’s promotion happened to overlap with "Neverland Girl," so he was included in all the promotional announcements, getting a lot of exposure, which led to this individual booking for the holographic variety show.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao’s public persona is proud and cold.
 

 
His subconscious personality is reserved, a bit of a "chuunibyou" (youthful delusion), and he loves to act cool. The characters he plays fit the mold perfectly…
 

 
The bullet comments exploded.
 

 
It wasn’t because Ye Fanxiao’s momentum was strong or his fame was high.
 

 
Half of the guests for "Baby Chaos" had been announced, while the other half had not.
 

 
The audience watching the live stream was waiting for Tong Zhao to appear, thinking it was normal for her to be the final guest, given her status.
 

 
But as they kept waiting…
 

 
All the big guests had already been introduced??
 

 
They introduced the small guest!
 

 
Where’s Tong Zhao?
 

 
The official Weibo promoted Tong Zhao so heavily, where did she go?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans were the first to get upset.
 

 
After all, the official Weibo had promoted Tong Zhao, so her fans naturally worked hard to promote ‘Baby Chaos’, spreading the word and recommending it everywhere. Generally speaking, the first half of the live-streamed instinctive variety show is free, to attract viewers. Fans didn’t think too much about it—if they said their "sister" would appear, they just directly bought the viewing rights without hesitation.
 

 
They had paid and put in the effort.
 

 
But now the host is saying there's no Tong Zhao?
 

 
This vague and misleading promotion to gain fans is even worse. No fan would tolerate it. Even though Tong Zhao's fans were usually laid-back, they flooded the official comment section with criticism, and most bystanders could understand why. Lying is unethical, and fans had paid money specifically for Tong Zhao—this is false advertising.
 

 
Girls in fan circles, aside from anything else, are really fast at typing.
 

 
A massive barrage of question marks flooded the entire screen, which was quite spectacular.
 

 
Audience members who had been paying attention to the pre-show promotions could already feel the storm brewing from the fans' anger. Some fans of Ye Fanxiao, who were more observant, quietly kept their mouths shut, not daring to appear too happy in the comments. They murmured to themselves...
 

 
“Is our brother going to replace Xiao Zhao’s position?”
 

 
“No way, right? He’s not that good, is he?”
 

 
“If he were that good, wouldn’t our Fan Shao have been placed at the center position a long time ago? He should’ve debuted with a clear lead!”
 

 
Whispering.jpg
 

 
Whimpering.jpg
 

 
The anger reached its peak, and just as the fans were about to unleash a barrage of insults aimed at the show’s director…
 

 
The live-stream screen showed a fair, smooth sleeping face.
 

 
The big guests and small guests had different starting points.
 

 
The big guests were in a living room with sofas and coffee tables.
 

 
The small guest’s starting point looked like a kindergarten playroom, with soft woolen mats covering the floor. Colorful pillows were stacked into small mountains, and even the corners of a one-meter-high bookshelf were padded for safety.
 

 
A little girl, around six years old, was lying on her side on the pillow mountain.
 

 
The girl’s jet-black long hair was spread behind her, and her soft, pink little face looked like a glutinous rice ball. Her rosy, plump lips were like jelly, and she looked so delicious. When the camera zoomed in, her long, curled eyelashes fluttered, and this angelic sleeping face made even the most furious fans hesitate for a moment before pressing the send button on the comments, afraid of disturbing the little angel’s sleep…
 

 
However, there was another layer to this.
 

 
This… this… this…
 

 
Isn’t this just ‘Xiao Zhao’s’ character from ‘Neverland Girl’?
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans and the audience's minds went blank, and in an instant, the comments section was flooded with thousands of exclamations.
 

 
Some fans, too quick to react, sent out insults but quickly corrected themselves with lightning-fast fingers.
 

 
As a result, the comments turned into a chorus of "realizing" moments:
 

 
[The show team is treating us like fools!]
 

 
[How could anyone come up with such a genius move? Amazing! Love you, mom, mua.]
 

 
[Director Sima, come out here!]
 

 
[Flatter me! ps. Sima refers to the director, not Sima Yi.]
 

 
[Take out my Italian cannon!]
 

 
[Let's set off some fireworks for the director of the show to cheer him up!]
 

 
This drifting speed—if Takumi Fujiwara were here, he’d have to bow in respect.
 

 
Who could watch this and not say that Sichuan Opera’s face-changing technique is really amazing?
 

 
The barrage of comments about face-changing stunned other viewers, with quick-handed fans taking screenshots and posting them on Weibo to share with friends, all laughing together. Netizens who understood the situation were also very sympathetic, joking about [the director’s mom being pushed to the Naihe Bridge, with fans performing a dramatic scene of pulling her back from the underworld after spitting out the Meng Po soup, treating her like royalty at a lavish banquet]. Some said the production team deserved the criticism, but it was definitely part of their promotional strategy—creating a twist to generate buzz and topic heat.
 

 
Then, netizens started wondering: ‘How did Tong Zhao turn into a little kid?’
 

 
Of course, fans rushed to explain.
 

 
---
 

 
“Guest #1, Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“In reality, she’s a famous actress with box office earnings in the billions. She became famous at a young age and has more fame and experience than her peers. She’s been surrounded by scandals and was once a controversial figure, holding the top spot on Baidu's female celebrity index for an entire year.”
 

 
“With the help of a time machine, she’s turned back into a little child and is now joining our list of guests.”
 

 
“The production team has adjusted her age with some technical tricks, but her subconscious is uncontrollable. When this little angel with a sweet face wakes up, what kind of surprises will she bring to our show?”
 

 
As the host's introduction ended, he said, “Let’s gather 10,000 likes to wake Xiao Zhao up!”
 

 
As soon as the words were spoken, a button appeared on the live stream.
 

 
This interactive segment was one of the highlights of ‘Baby Chaos’.
 

 
Having a "cloud" interaction with a little glutinous rice ball was an unimaginable joy!
 

 
With the sound effect of [deng deng deng deng deng], the like bar quickly filled up and overflowed.
 

 
A cute version of Mickey Mouse’s hand appeared out of nowhere in the air and gently poked Xiao Zhao’s cheek.
 

 
Her cotton-candy-like cheek dented slightly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao, poked in her sleep, furrowed her brows and pouted her soft lips.
 

 
The white hand was about to poke again when Xiao Zhao flipped over, burying her cheek into the pillow, refusing to be poked.
 

 
However, the merciless production team poked her on the back of the head.
 

 
Xiao Zhao mumbled something in her sleep, and due to being unclear, the audience only heard a very sweet-sounding "um-mee."
 

 
[Awsl—! Medic! Where’s the medic?]
 

 
[I want her to keep sleeping, but I also want to poke her and see her reaction. I’m a sinner!]
 

 
[I’m saving this episode to watch over and over again, ahhhh, I hate it, when will they release a pet like Xiao Zhao? I want to raise her, qwq.]
 

 
The entire barrage was filled with fans wanting to "cloud-raise" Xiao Zhao.
 

 
When the production team saw that the cuteness was working, they really flipped Xiao Zhao over and twisted her cheek.
 

 
They twisted it hard, lifting one side of her tofu-like cheek upward.
 

 
The audience was shocked to discover that the tofu had turned into soft, chewy, rice cake-like skin—
 

 
[Excuse me, should we increase the intensity?]
 

 
[Yes/No].
# Chapter119
[Yes/No]
 

 
Xiao Zhao is so cute, how can they bully her!
 

 
This is what the barrage is saying.
 

 
However, in reality, the number of votes for [Yes] skyrocketed at an unbelievable speed.
 

 
Generally speaking, in interactive variety shows like this, the fans of the guests would coordinate their actions to ensure the maximum benefit for their beloved star.
 

 
But...
 

 
[No no no, poking Xiao Zhao's face hurts the mother's heart.]
 

 
[What does flipping my child over mean?! Let her sleep if she's tired!]
 

 
[This is too cruel, are you still human? Press 'Yes' hard!]
 

 
[Will she cry? Press 'Yes' if she will cry, and press 'Yes' even if she won’t /dog head.]
 

 
— Xiao Zhao's cloud mommy and cloud daddy can't come to an agreement!
 

 
The fake hand in the air poked Xiao Zhao’s face again.
 

 
She still kept her eyes closed, but raised her hand and waved it in the air, surprisingly managing to grab the finger of that annoying fake hand with her round Doraemon hand.
 

 
#Clever Xiao Zhao refusing to get out of bed.#
 

 
[Hahahaha, she's the smartest baby to her mommy!]
 

 
[Oh my God, was Tong Zhao this cute when she was little? Or does she still look like this now?]
 

 
[I've never seen this side of Tong Zhao. Whenever she attends public events... she always gives off this strong, independent vibe? I never imagined she had such a baby side!]
 

 
My heart is melting.
 

 
The production team didn’t expect Xiao Zhao's subconscious to love sleeping in so much. They quickly controlled the fake hand to escape Xiao Zhao's grip. The special effects team added a panicked sound effect, and to everyone's surprise, another fake hand appeared in mid-air. The two hands gently rubbed Xiao Zhao's cheeks—
 

 
Just like rubbing a cat, they rubbed Xiao Zhao!
 

 
"Ugh..."
 

 
This time, Xiao Zhao was really poked awake.
 

 
Since this is a variety show, children are unaware of the camera's presence and often can't control their temper. Audiences who are used to this type of show are more understanding of the little guests and won’t engage in vicious online bullying. The edited version of the show will intentionally reduce the audience's dislike for the mischievous kids by using editing techniques.
 

 
This approach received quite a bit of praise.
 

 
The director was very aware that having boundaries is necessary for long-term success.
 

 
The show is meant to be heartwarming, funny, and adorable. While provoking controversy might generate buzz in the short term, over time people won’t want to see kids on the show. The association would also issue warnings.
 

 
So, did Xiao Zhao get mad after being woken up?
 

 
The audience was really curious to see Xiao Zhao get angry.
 

 
She’s usually so perfect, without much to criticize. Her fans admire her from a distance, seeing her as a big star who’s not like someone who’s only been in the industry for a little over a year. Her dazzling achievements and illustrious titles are quite fitting. But the thing is, people’s attitudes toward stars are strange—if she always shows a perfect image, even the rare moments when she’s soft and vulnerable make people want to protect her.
 

 
Don’t ask, just want to ‘rua’ (squeeze/cuddle).
 

 
"I want to sleep..."
 

 
The top-notch recording equipment allowed the audience to hear her sweet, milk-like complaint very clearly.
 

 
Xiao Zhao opened her eyes.
 

 
The fake hand wasn’t very forceful when it rubbed her face earlier, but who would have thought her skin was so delicate? After being rubbed, the corner of her eye faintly turned red, and her bright, moist deer-like eyes angrily stared at the fake hand. The camera was set up behind the fake hand, and the audience was terrified by the intensity of her glare.
 

 
Xiao Zhao pouted and grabbed the culprit, not letting it go: "You bullied me, I’m telling mommy."
 

 
#First to report to mommy#
 

 
[Mom’s here! Mommy loves you! Director, come out and face your death!]
 

 
[Too much sweetness, sob sob sob, Xiao Zhao come to mommy’s arms and cry]
 

 
[Those who say mommy protects you must’ve voted 'yes' earlier.]
 

 
Some viewers thought about Xiao Zhao's father’s character and understood why she only goes to her mother when she's being bullied—what about her mom? Some veteran fans explained that Xiao Zhao only debuted after her mother passed away. However, she usually doesn’t talk about this; when reporters asked, she would downplay it and not give much of a response, as if she was indifferent about family ties.
 

 
But looking at how attached she is to her mom—can her family ties really be indifferent?
 

 
Xiao Zhao's grip was surprisingly strong, and the fake hand couldn't break free right away, eventually disappearing helplessly into thin air.
 

 
"Eh?"
 

 
Xiao Zhao couldn't believe it and reached out again into thin air.
 

 
Naturally, she grabbed nothing. There was nothing there.
 

 
Next, it was time to wake up the other little guests.
 

 
As everyone knows, when entering the holographic shooting, the transition of consciousness doesn't happen instantly. The stronger and broader the brain domain, the faster a person wakes up. That’s why, when filming survival variety shows, Xiao Zhao always woke up earlier than the others.
 

 
And this time was no different.
 

 
The host was about to wake up the other little guests when Xiao Zhao flipped off the pillow mountain and hopped twice to stretch her arms and legs. The other three little guests were scattered in different parts of the room.
 

 
Xiao Zhao raised her head.
 

 
The audience was confused, thinking she was about to do some aerobics. Just then, when the camera cut to wake up another little boy, Xiao Zhao took three steps with a ‘thud’ and skillfully grabbed the fake hand.
 

 
She had been observing, waiting for the hand that kept poking her face to appear!
 

 
"You can’t bully the other kids."
 

 
Xiao Zhao’s serious expression looked just like a kindergarten leader.
 

 
[Our Xiao Zhao has been domineering since she was little!]
 

 
[Give Xiao Zhao a cigarette... no, a lollipop!]
 

 
[Don’t say anything, the bottle is filled with white wine, full to the top. After drinking it, let out a big milk burp.]
 

 
The production team had no choice but to send a nanny from the holographic show into the room. She crouched down and gently explained to Xiao Zhao that it was time for the kids to leave school, and if they didn’t wake up, their parents would be waiting outside for a long time. Unexpectedly, Xiao Zhao accepted the explanation and didn’t stop the nanny from waking up the other little guest, sitting quietly on the side instead.
 

 
Even though she didn’t know the cameras were filming, Xiao Zhao still sat very quietly and well-behaved, without making any extra movements. Her calm little face subtly showed the future star power she would have. Fans suddenly realized that Xiao Zhao had been a well-behaved angel since she was young.
 

 
I really want to take her home and raise her, she looks so easy to handle.
 

 
This time, there were five adults, but only four little guests.
 

 
So, one of the little guests could choose to be taken care of by two adults.
 

 
The variety show had many strange settings. Due to the codes placed at more fundamental positions, the guests accepted these bizarre settings as naturally as they would accept that one plus one equals two. Next came the part where the children and parents chose each other.
 

 
Since it was the first episode, the host interviewed both the adult and child guests about what kind of guardian and child they would like to have.
 

 
When asked, Zhang Shi spoke with slight sorrow:
 

 
"What kind of child? One like mine, someone who looks like they’re my biological child at first glance, that would be great."
 

 
The show was playing to its maximum effect.
 

 
Zhang Shi had played many roles of honest, straightforward people.
 

 
Although playing the same type of character in ‘Instinct Films’ was common, it did bring some psychological issues. For example, Zhang Shi, who had never been betrayed in reality, was subconsciously affected by these thoughts.
 

 
The glamorous Long Fei didn’t seem like she was there to pick up a child, but more like she was there to perform. She explicitly said: "Can I want whatever I like? Then I want a beautiful and talented child, one who can get first place."
 

 
Just as the audience was about to develop a negative impression, the host asked her what if the child was unattractive and not very smart?
 

 
Long Fei answered nonchalantly: "I’ll still raise them. What am I supposed to do, put them back in my stomach and redo them? No? If they’re ugly, I’ll just make more money. If you have money, you won’t be ugly."
 

 
The other female guest, Xie Zihan, couldn’t answer the question.
 

 
She was only twenty years old and hadn’t thought about having children.
 

 
"I’d be a bit scared of not taking care of the child properly."
 

 
"I’d like to team up with the other parents later."
 

 
In contrast to her lively and bright appearance on the talent show, Xie Zihan’s subconscious was a bit reserved and shy. Her manager was visibly restless—on the show, she and Xiao Zhao shared some similarities, but in ‘Instinct Variety’, she was completely different.
 

 
Ye Fanxiao shrugged: "I can take care of myself."
 

 
That answer was pretty unreliable.
 

 
But Ye Fanxiao, at 25, was still in the prime of his career in the entertainment industry. Men in this field typically have a longer golden period, and he still carried the "little fresh meat" label, adopting the cool, charismatic, and rebellious persona. So, this response was expected.
 

 
Moreover, there was still Jiang Dang behind him.
 

 
The audience felt that his answer would be even more unreliable.
 

 
This was also why the host had arranged for him to be last. They felt he had a good sense of humor.
 

 
...
 

 
"Children?"
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the sofa, his long legs casually draped over the armrest.
 

 
When he heard the host’s question, he shifted his gaze and, as he looked at the host, he unknowingly made eye contact with the camera behind him. His eyes held a cool, captivating gleam, and with his voice, which seemed to exude desire to the extreme, he said something that even a dog wouldn’t want to hear:
 

 
“I want someone who can take care of me.”
 

 
A question mark filled the entire live broadcast screen.
 

 
The host, unable to believe it, repeated his words: “Take care of you? Mr. Jiang, this... this doesn’t seem right.”
 

 
You’re a charming and aloof villain, expecting innocent and cute children to take care of you.
 

 
Is this okay? It’s not okay.
 

 
“What’s wrong with that?”
 

 
Jiang Dang was genuinely surprised, having never thought that his words might be inappropriate. It seemed as though the host’s implied criticism had struck a nerve, and he slightly lowered his eyelashes, casting a soft shadow over his cold, fair skin: “My agent knows. I’m very obedient and easy to handle.”
 

 
At home, his agent was so furious that they reached for an emergency heart-saving pill.
 

 
They shouldn’t have agreed to let him appear on ‘Instinct Variety’.
 

 
Acting is one thing; you can always use “character settings” to brush it off, but this was clearly a glimpse of his true nature!
 

 
And he’s easy to handle, huh?
 

 
His agent was anxious, but it didn’t cause much of a stir among Jiang Dang’s fans.
 

 
After all, it wasn’t the first time he’d been unreliable. He wasn’t even married in real life, so it’s not like he was being irresponsible toward actual children. He doesn’t care about creating a persona and focuses on making hit love songs, occasionally showing his face. That’s enough for him.
 

 
This answer strangely stirred up some maternal instincts in certain female fans, who suddenly wanted to take care of him.
 

 
It can only be said that as long as you have good looks, you can always spark affection in unexpected ways.
 

 
The host was struggling: “So, Mr. Jiang, you want to find someone who can take care of you?”
 

 
Jiang Dang shook his head: “I’d like to think that, but that kind of thing doesn’t happen.” The handsome guy looked even more troubled, and the audience laughed so hard they almost fell over. So, it turns out he has some common sense after all. They had thought he really wanted to find a little baby to take care of a silly dad.
 

 
“As long as they can look at me,”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled slightly: “They’re my child.”
 

 
— My, child.
 

 
The last two words, “child,” were pronounced with emphasis. What should have been a completely serious statement was instead delivered like a tender love confession.
 

 
The female audience couldn’t laugh anymore.
 

 
Originally, the audience watched him like they would watch a silly kid, but now they couldn’t handle it anymore. Their preferences were under attack, and their ears were ringing!
 

 
[Ahhh, I want to be Brother Dang’s child, Dang, come to me head-on!]
 

 
[Looks aren’t important, it’s his voice, ah, I really want to do ‘kkp’ with him.]
 

 
[‘kkp’? What does that mean?]
 

 
[Stop posting such comments on a variety show that kids are watching!!]
 

 
The topic of ‘kkp’ was dropped there.
 

 
The agent’s worries about cleaning up his fan base were unnecessary. Jiang Dang didn’t think appearing on this show would cause him any problems. He was clearly a sensible and mature adult. After the interview, the caregiver led the four kids out of the game room...
 

 
A string of kids.
 

 
Zhao Zai was walking in the front, holding hands with a boy and a girl on either side.
 

 
The little girl had a flower bud hairstyle, and her round face was framed by a pair of bright, lively eyes. She was a bit shy, tightly holding onto Zhao Zai’s hand. The other boy was also about six years old, and seemed a bit nervous.
 

 
There was only one young boy with brown hair, walking with his hands behind his back, lingering at the back.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t want to interact with anyone.
 

 
Black hair and black eyes are dominant genes, so having blonde hair and blue eyes was unlikely. But the mixed-race little Noah took after his father. His hair was lighter in color, with large eyes, long lashes, and a high nose. He looked like a second-generation star with the right genes, combining the softness of an Easterner with the deep contours of a Germanic person. If you looked closely, his eyes even had a gentle blue hue, and he looked like a child from an oil painting.
 

 
Good-looking people have privileges.
 

 
Even though he acted aloof, as soon as he appeared, he immediately captured the hearts of many fans who loved good looks, with people calling him the perfect little boy of their dreams.
 

 
However, what more people were curious about was what happened in the room earlier. Why were the two little kids sticking to their "big mother hen" Zhao Zai like chicks sticking to their mother hen?
 

 
Those who were watching the live broadcast from the kids’ side explained in the comments—
 

 
[In short, it’s the scene of picking up little brothers.]
 

 
＊
 

 
Let’s rewind to ten minutes ago.
 

 
The caregiver was interviewing the kids about what kind of parents they wanted.
 

 
In the kids' subconscious, their memories of their mom and dad were temporarily blocked, making them feel like they were being born again, choosing their own parents to spend seven days with. However, after Jia Jia and Xiao Quan woke up, they were still in a panic, pouting and wanting to cry, and even the caregiver’s comforting hugs didn’t help.
 

 
When Zhao Zai walked over, held their hands, and softly coaxed them, it worked.
 

 
Why was that?
 

 
Viewers analyzed that, for young children, adults are like beings from another level, and the caregiver’s comfort only scratched the surface. When Jia Jia saw another little boy on the verge of tears, she wanted to cry too. But when she saw Zhao Zai...
 

 
“There are so many pillows here,” Zhao Zai naturally took her hand and spoke, “It feels a little smaller than the kindergarten I used to go to. Did you sleep enough just now?”
 

 
The little girl had tears in her eyes and nodded dumbly.
 

 
The little boy who had been on the verge of crying earlier watched her calmly, as if he had found a pillar of support. He also came over and wanted to hold her hand: “I... I didn’t sleep enough!”
 

 
“Well, we can find another chance to nap later,”
 

 
Life isn’t easy, Zhao Zai sighed: “I didn’t sleep enough either.”
 

 
[Look at what you two have done!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao must be really busy with work. She always appears so energetic in public, but it turns out she has such a sleepy side behind the scenes. Adorable beauty.]
 

 
[What’s the deal with this little boy holding my girl’s hand? Zhao Zai can’t have an early crush, I won’t let this little brat take advantage, her dad won’t allow it!]
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand much about how to speak to others.
 

 
Consort Chen knows how to flirt, Duan Ge can mix both kindness and authority, and Shuyi knows how to coax people...
 

 
Adults have many tricks and techniques.
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t know any of that, but she was simply the most dazzling kid in kindergarten.
 

 
Some people are just born to be big shots.
 

 
The two little kids clung to Zhao Zai like accessories, while Noah, who had just woken up, stared at her with a displeased expression. His handsome face fell.
 

 
Two tigers can’t coexist on the same mountain!
# Chapter120
The two little children tightly held onto Zhao Zai's hand.
 

 
Perhaps because they now had a reliable support, they were not particularly interested in the other adults. When asked if they wanted to play games with any of the older brothers or sisters, they shook their heads vigorously.
 

 
The host had already anticipated this, so the living room was prepared with a lot of toys.
 

 
Children who appear on this kind of show don’t usually lack toys in real life, but no child would ever complain about having too many toys. It’s in their DNA to prefer new and exciting things. When the two of them saw three large boxes filled with various brightly colored toys, all new and shiny, their eyes immediately stuck to them.
 

 
Only Noah crossed his arms, looking disdainfully at the toys.
 

 
What’s so fun about these toy planes and boats?
 

 
The host, seeing this, immediately squatted down with a smile and asked, "If you don’t want to play games, would you like to play with the toys together with the older brothers and sisters?"
 

 
“Well… a little,” Jia Jia hesitated as she shook Zhao Zai’s hand.
 

 
The other boy whispered, "I want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
Jia Jia blinked her watery eyes once, worried about falling behind, and quickly agreed, "I also want to play with Tong Zhao."
 

 
So, who will Tong Zhao play with?
 

 
The audience was a little curious.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao debuted, there had been a few rumors about her, with some even calling her a "sea king." However, these were just rumors. Aside from Wei Zekai showing anxiety about possibly having dinner with Tong Zhao in her live stream, there had been no such rumors involving the other men.
 

 
If there was anything going on, would it be this peaceful?
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head to the left and bumped her head against Jia Jia’s. "I’ll play with you."
 

 
Then she tilted her head to the right, "You play too."
 

 
---
 

 
[True Master of Balancing Water]
 

 
[The Kindergarten "Sea King" Is Actually Right Next to Me]
 

 
[I Want to Stick with Zhao Zai, I Want to Play with Toys Too!]
 

 
At this moment, Noah loudly said, "What’s so fun about these toys for kids?"
 

 
As he spoke, he disdainfully turned up his nose at the toy box.
 

 
This time, the two little kids, who had been absorbed by the toys, were no longer happy.
 

 
Children’s unhappiness is written all over their faces. Although they didn’t start crying immediately, Noah’s words had already put him in the “we don’t want to play with him” category in their minds.
 

 
The host was about to console them when Zhao Zai turned her head to look at him.
 

 
Her eyes were a light shade, clear and bright, and even though she was so small, it was obvious she had a beautiful face. Noah, under her steady gaze, suddenly felt a bit anxious and short of breath…
 

 
This wasn’t the first time.
 

 
When he had woken up earlier in the game room and saw this child for the first time, his heart had skipped a beat in an uncomfortable way.
 

 
What does this mean?
 

 
It means they were natural enemies!
 

 
It’s like Ultraman seeing a monster.
 

 
It’s like the Black Cat Sheriff seeing a cat-eating rat.
 

 
It’s like the Calabash Brothers seeing the Snake Spirit!
 

 
Noah, feeling a sense of impending danger, said, "Why are you looking at me?"
 

 
"I was thinking…"
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her little head. "These are toys for kids, so we must be kids then."
 

 
This child doesn’t seem very bright.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Noah was momentarily speechless.
 

 
"What’s fun about these toy boats and planes? I don’t like them. If we’re going to play, let’s play with real planes and big ships." At this point, Noah’s expression turned smug. "Do you know what those are? They can carry a lot of people and fly in the sky or float on the water."
 

 
In the world of children, knowing more than your classmates is a big deal.
 

 
Of course, this logic tends to carry over to school and the workplace as well.
 

 
The audience in the live stream couldn’t help but marvel at the world of the rich.
 

 
Noah’s parents were wealthy, and in reality, they often traveled by private plane.
 

 
Although he had forgotten about this fact while participating in the variety show, his subconscious made it clear that they weren’t starting from the same place.
 

 
"Oh~"
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded seriously.
 

 
"Don’t mind him."
 

 
Jia Jia lightly tugged at Zhao Zai’s sleeve. Noah’s attitude made her feel uncomfortable.
 

 
After thinking it over, Zhao Zai really wanted to "borrow" Noah’s big plane and big ship:
 

 
"Can you bring them out and play with us?"
 

 
"How could I bring them out? I-I don’t have any… I was just saying, real planes and ships are much more fun. These toys for little kids aren’t interesting at all."
 

 
Noah thought what he said made a lot of sense.
 

 
But, loud as he was, his confidence started to waver.
 

 
"So you don’t have big planes and big ships, huh?" Zhao Zai sighed, her disappointment evident. "I thought you were really impressive."
 

 
...
 

 
"…Well, I’m still way better than you playing with these toys!"
 

 
If broken hearts could make a sound, it would be the frustrated voice of young Master Noah now. His pride shattered into pieces, and there was a slight hint of a sob in his voice.
 

 
Realizing his mental state was breaking down, Noah, to avoid crying in front of everyone, tightly pressed his lips together and sniffed. When he noticed Zhao Zai looked like she was about to say something else, he quickly braced himself and gave her a fierce glare—
 

 
What else was this annoying woman going to say to hurt him?
 

 
He had mentally prepared himself.
 

 
Zhao Zai, with a face full of hope, said, "Then you have to work hard to get a big ship and a big plane. If you get one, remember to take me to play!"
 

 
After saying that, she acted like the topic was over, pulling her two little followers to the seats arranged by the host. She sat gracefully and quietly, like a well-behaved little princess. Noah was caught off guard, stunned in place, before the nanny coaxed him into sitting down.
 

 
[Ah, this…]
 

 
[Look at the reaction of this little rich boy. Is he liking Zhao Zai?]
 

 
[Does a six-year-old even know what "liking" means?]
 

 
[Sigh, whether or not they understand "liking," it's definitely true that they are all about looks. My son only wants to lend his toys to classmates who look good, and he likes uncles and aunts who are good-looking. He’s always drawn to familiar faces.]
 

 
The audience couldn’t help but sigh that appreciating beauty is human nature.
 

 
The audience’s guess was pretty close, and Noah’s face didn’t hide anything.
 

 
But it wasn’t as pink and bubbly as the audience thought.
 

 
Noah wanted to be the center of attention, to have Zhao Zai admire him, and to express his superiority by belittling the toys they were playing with. When things didn’t go the way he expected, he became anxious and embarrassed. Because he was good-looking, Noah was somewhat of a child star. He was often flown around by his mother to attend events as part of her way of gaining publicity, which meant he had no fixed school to attend.
 

 
His father was wealthy and hired excellent tutors, so not only did Noah never fall behind in his studies, he even learned better than his peers.
 

 
However, this also meant he didn’t have much experience interacting with children his own age.
 

 
＊
 

 
With Zhao Zai’s active mediation, the two little followers who had been playing for a while finally weren’t so shy anymore. They understood that, although Tong Zhao was great, she was still just a child like them. She couldn’t be their guardian, and they still needed to choose a parent.
 

 
However, when it came to choosing a guardian, the two children still felt a bit reluctant.
 

 
Noah noticed how hesitant they were and felt a bit disgusted. He was thinking to himself, what could he do now to stand out? Why hadn’t anyone begged him to be their child yet?
 

 
At this moment, Zhao Zai’s sense of responsibility once again drove her to step forward.
 

 
“It’s actually not scary,”
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped off the sofa and confidently presented herself to everyone, her expression serious. She had a pair of beautiful eyes, her light-colored pupils misty and round, looking as innocent as a fawn’s eyes. But her high, elegant brow and nose gave her face a full, graceful look, the perfect prototype of a little beauty growing into a stunning one.
 

 
She lifted a bright smile:
 

 
“Is there anyone willing to be my guardian for a while?”
 

 
...
 

 
[I'll do it! I'll do it!]
 

 
[Be my baby forever, Zhao Zai is so well-behaved.]
 

 
[Seriously wondering why that lousy father would choose that little sister.]
 

 
Whether it was during the game earlier or in her current speech, Zhao Zai always gave off the impression that she was easy to take care of, which made the guests very drawn to her. Both Ye Xiaofan and Long Fei thought she was very suitable for them and started competing for her.
 

 
It was just a reality variety show.
 

 
Just like the "China’s Good Voice" segment where the guests compete for contestants, they always do so with genuine emotions. It’s the most authentic side of the guests' subconscious, and it’s exactly what the audience loves to see.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, true to form, made a disdainful face: “You wear such heavy makeup, can you really take care of a child?”
 

 
“You wear makeup too, so why criticize me?” Long Fei smirked. “Tong Zhao is a girl. It’s more appropriate for a female guardian to take care of her than a male one.”
 

 
...
 

 
This was something Ye Xiaofan hadn’t expected.
 

 
"Baby Chaos" didn’t actually have a rule that the gender of the guests had to match that of the child.
 

 
In real life, it’s hard to guarantee the boundaries of interactions between the opposite sex, but in the holographic world, it’s much easier to control. When guests participate in children’s shows, they sign contracts waiving certain privacy rights, allowing instruments to scan them and ensuring they have no tendencies toward pedophilia. This was taken to the utmost level in protecting children.
 

 
However, if the same guests were competing, there was an advantage to being the same gender.
 

 
For example, for younger children, or those who don’t have the habit of bathing alone, it’s necessary for a same-gender guest to take care of them.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, having been outmaneuvered, clicked his tongue in frustration.
 

 
The nice guy Zhang Shi and Xie Zihan saw that the two were getting into a competition and didn’t want to argue with them. Instead, they quietly started talking to the other two children.
 

 
Only Noah, who had been expected to be one of the highlights of the show, was ignored.
 

 
And what about Jiang Dang?
 

 
He seemed to have been offline for quite a while.
 

 
Fans were anxiously hoping that the older brother would grab more screen time, but upon reflection, they realized he didn’t really need this exposure. They sighed, thinking that wherever he ended up, it didn’t really matter. He probably didn’t care much about being stuck with the prickly Noah.
 

 
Just as Ye Xiaofan was in the middle of arguing with Long Fei, Jiang Dang unexpectedly sneakily made his way over to Zhao Zai’s side:
 

 
"Do you like listening to music?"
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively raised her hand and scratched her ear.
 

 
For some reason, whenever this man spoke, her ears felt itchy.
 

 
She nodded.
 

 
Jiang Dang lowered his head and gently hummed a few verses of a popular children's song, singing whatever was trending.
 

 
His voice was so catchy that even the two children who had been talking to Zhang Shi leaned in: “Brother, can you sing something else?”
 

 
“I can sing anything. What do you want to hear?”
 

 
“‘Blue Bird’! The theme song of ‘Naruto Shippuden’—do you know ‘Naruto’?”
 

 
Jiang Dang hummed a part of the Chinese version of the theme song, which totally mesmerized the kids.
 

 
After arguing with Long Fei for seven rounds, Ye Xiaofan finally sensed something was wrong.
 

 
He turned around to look.
 

 
Well, well, the bad guy wasn’t being honest, was he? Instead of talking, he was over there singing songs to amuse the children?
 

 
“Don’t listen to him, let me show you some dance moves.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had stood out in the competition because of his excellent street dance skills.
 

 
Saying that, he did a one-handed windmill spin right there on the spot.
 

 
This wasn’t something that had happened before. The segment, originally filled with warmth, had turned into a talent show, and the audience felt like they had somehow tuned into the neighboring show, ‘China’s New Dance King’.
 

 
The two kids were impressed by the cool move, and Zhao Zai looked up at Jiang Dang and asked, “Can you do that too?”
 

 
“…I can’t! Can you dance?”
 

 
“I can do ballet.”
 

 
Zhao Zai answered seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang: “Then can you choose me to be your guardian, and teach me ballet?”
# Chapter121
What is going on here?
 

 
It’s like everyone else is pulling money out of their pockets, showing it to the little girl and saying, “If you follow me, I can give you a lot of money,” and then this guy jumps out and says, “Sister, give me some.”
 

 
[Hahahahahaha]
 

 
[You really can't predict what kind of crazy move he’ll pull next.]
 

 
[Can't do anything right, but top the list in talking. Looks like singing kids' songs to entertain children is his emotional intelligence highlight, thank goodness for that.]
 

 
The audience was laughing happily.
 

 
However, the next second, after thinking seriously, Zhao Zai asked, “Do you really want to learn? There are almost no boys in my class.”
 

 
Ballet, because of its tight-fitting costumes and graceful, feminine movements, is often regarded as a dance exclusively for girls. Not only in China, but even abroad, there have been cases of young boys who were bullied for learning ballet and even committed suicide because of it.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked in return: “Boys can’t learn ballet? Do you think it’s inappropriate?”
 

 
His tone didn’t sound like he was talking to a child, but more like discussing a phenomenon with a peer.
 

 
Zhao Zai thought for a moment, then seriously said in her sweet little voice: “You can, I don’t think it’s inappropriate. If you want to learn, I can teach you, but learning ballet is hard. I’m not a teacher, I can only tell you what the teacher taught me and repeat it to you~”
 

 
“Pinky promise?”
 

 
Jiang Dang reached out his hand, and Zhao Zai didn’t hesitate to place her much smaller hand in his, linking their fingers and giving a gentle shake.
 

 
This warm and friendly scene, however, was met with nothing but question marks in the comments section.
 

 
It can be called a large-scale online confusion scene.
 

 
[Zhao Zai——]
 

 
[LOL, I’m already feeling what it’s like for a girl to run off with an unreliable guy.]
 

 
[I’m all for the Dang-Zhao CP... but I bought the viewing rights expecting to see them together raising a cute kid, not Zhao Zai turning into the cute kid! The affection has warped! This is fatherly love!]
 

 
Some more rational viewers analyzed that this development actually made sense.
 

 
Others were performing talents, which were nice to watch, just for the fun of it.
 

 
It might attract ordinary kids who, because they admired Ye Xiaofan, want to live with him and see the big windmill every day. However, for Zhao Zai, there was no need for that. From the moment she woke up in the show, she instinctively went to take care of the weaker ones. Whenever others asked for her help or relied on her, as long as it was reasonable, she was willing to lend them a hand.
 

 
Meanwhile, Ye Xiaofan, who was dancing very energetically, was already sweating.
 

 
The fans and kids were enjoying it, and the fans thought he had seized the opportunity to appear on the show and proved that he was truly talented at dancing, not just someone who knew a little and used his love for street dance as a gimmick.
 

 
The two little kids, who were mesmerized, clapped for him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan turned around to look at Zhao Zai: "How was it, big brother... [sound muted]!"
 

 
Zhao Zai was wearing a pink little genius phone watch on her left wrist.
 

 
This was a symbol that the little guest had already found their parent.
 

 
Throughout the whole show, this phone watch could only connect to her parents and the host.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan shifted his gaze and indeed saw Jiang Dang, who was fiddling with a matching pink phone. The phone only had the most basic functions. Jiang Dang could certainly use it, but as he absentmindedly played with the phone, it seemed like he didn’t even know how to use it. Zhao Zai immediately leaned over to teach the big brother how to use the phone.
 

 
Special effects text displayed: "The smart AI has captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts..."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"The smart AI captured nothing!"
 

 
He was just zoning out while looking cool with his charming and aloof face.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to teach him, but Jiang Dang didn’t tell her that he actually knew how to use it, so he listened to her.
 

 
The audience knew he was listening.
 

 
Because when Zhao Zai spoke to him, the smart AI finally managed to capture his thoughts. He was silently repeating Zhao Zai’s words in his head, carefully taking in all the small phone tips that no adult would understand: [Press here to call her, the camera is over there, you can also set an alarm…]
 

 
[So many functions!]
 

 
The handsome guy had an epiphany.
 

 
[... What are you suddenly realizing?!]
 

 
The comments on the live stream were uncontrollable at this point.
 

 
The audience's mood resonated with Ye Xiaofan's incredulous expression.
 

 
After understanding the whole situation, Ye Xiaofan’s mentality collapsed even more: “Jiang Dang, I danced, okay? What about you? What did you do?”
 

 
“Hmm.”
 

 
Jiang Dang, who was directly called out, raised his eyes and looked at him sincerely.
 

 
That gaze was really quite sincere.
 

 
If his manager, who was watching the live stream, saw that look, they would’ve had a PTSD flashback right on the spot.
 

 
When Ye Xiaofan questioned him, Jiang Dang slowly clapped his hands and sincerely praised him: “You danced really well.”
 

 
?
 

 
Little friend, do you have many questions?
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought he was being mocked and was about to blow up right there. But Jiang Dang flipped over his phone and showed him the album: “I just took a really handsome one.”
 

 
In the album, there was Ye Xiaofan mid-Crazy Freeze.
 

 
The photo caught him with a cold expression doing a high-difficulty move, exuding a cool and charismatic aura—he really did look pretty handsome.
 

 
“Ah...”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan scratched his nose, looking like a big lion whose fur was stroked the right way: “Not bad, I guess. It’s pretty average, normal level.”
 

 
He completely forgot that he had come to question Jiang Dang because his turf was invaded, and that he had used his own phone to ask for this candid shot. Ye Xiaofan’s fans were torn between being heartbroken that their brother was so easy to fool and honestly following along to screenshot the perfect shot.
 

 
Jiang Dang taking a candid shot of Ye Xiaofan turned out to be another marketing talking point.
 

 
Moreover, the shot was flawless!
 

 
The audience looked at Jiang Dang with different eyes now.
 

 
Was he a white-cut-black type, or was this just a lucky mistake?
 

 
In any case, Ye Xiaofan, who had been shown up by his own handsomeness, felt embarrassed and didn’t press the matter further. Meanwhile, Long Fei, who saw Zhao Zai leaving with Jiang Dang, was a little troubled. But after thinking about it, she realized that she neither knew how to sing nor dance, and then she glanced at the face that had cooled her anger... She silently decided to let it go with a simple “forget it.”
 

 
Others were going their separate ways. Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai went to cultivate their relationship.
 

 
Long Fei and the ever-patient Xie Zihan took away Jia Jia.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had conquered Xiao Quan with his street dance, but unfortunately, the little boy wasn’t assertive enough. Ye Xiaofan, however, was more interested in the handsome Noah. Noah had been observing quietly, feeling quite ignored since the beginning. This time, being actively chosen, he didn’t put on airs and happily put on the gold-colored little genius watch.
 

 
In the end, Zhang Shi took over Xiao Quan.
 

 
The two of them standing together surprisingly gave off a somewhat cute father-son vibe.
 

 
Each “temporary family” is assigned a separate detached house, with each family living next to each other for seven days. During this period, there will be occasional activities and competitions. Before they separated, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia pulled Zhao Zai aside and whispered to her.
 

 
“I heard from Brother Fan that your parent isn’t reliable,”
 

 
Xiao Quan said in a low voice, “Why don’t you come live with me instead? My uncle is very reliable.”
 

 
Zhang Shi had a certain big brother aura about him.
 

 
Even though he hadn’t done anything, just looking at him gave people a sense of safety.
 

 
Jia Jia, in a hurry, interrupted: “Zhao Zai should live with me. I have two beautiful sisters at home!”
 

 
The instinctive variety show doesn’t mean that everyone just speaks their mind without restraint. It’s just a little more relaxed compared to reality. Ye Xiaofan, in most real-life situations, is someone who speaks his mind, so he was the one to openly express what the other guests thought of Jiang Dang— a genius songwriter with a mind that worked differently from others. Could he really take care of a child? Ye Xiaofan was skeptical.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans were quite nervous, worried that Jiang Dang's fans might get angry.
 

 
But then the fans wearing Jiang Dang’s fan badges were all agreeing:
 

 
[“You think my Brother Dang isn’t reliable? I’m fine with being called crazy.”]
 

 
Ye Xiaofan's fans: [……]
 

 
You could only say, fans follow their idol.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head, her voice soft but firm:
 

 
“I just met Brother Dang, and I don’t know what kind of adult he is, so…”
 

 
Jia Jia quickly interrupted her: “What if he doesn’t know how to bathe himself?”
 

 
Jiang Dang's fans: [……]
 

 
That was a bit too much.
 

 
In a child’s world, they’re willing to believe many strange guesses and don’t preemptively limit answers. Zhao Zai was a bit startled by this assumption—oh right, what if an adult who doesn’t even know how to use a phone (but he does) doesn’t know how to bathe himself? She didn’t learn to bathe on her own until after her fifth birthday. Her mother had installed a handrail in the bathroom at her height to prevent her from falling.
 

 
At first, her mother would sit next to her and watch her bathe. Later, when Zhao Zai got used to it, her mother would wait outside the bathroom door.
 

 
Zhao Zai firmly believed that, whether adults or children, there are tasks that must be solved on one’s own.
 

 
And she would never be defeated by difficulty.
 

 
No matter how tall the mountain standing in front of her, it would only ignite Zhao Zai’s fighting spirit!
 

 
Zhao Zai quietly clenched her fist and, with the resolve of Zheng Chenggong restoring the Ming Dynasty and Liu Bei reviving the Han Empire, said resolutely: “If he doesn’t know how to bathe, I’ll teach him. I’ll teach him until he knows how. Since he’s an adult, he should learn faster than me. I took three days to learn how to bathe myself. I’ll teach Brother Dang to bathe on his own within two days!”
 

 
What a heroic spirit.
 

 
The two little children and the audience in the live stream were deeply shocked.
 

 
“Alright then,” Jia Jia said, reluctantly tugging at her hand. “If you really can’t teach him, you have to tell us, so that Sister Fei and Sister Zi Han can teach him together.”
 

 
“And me, and me!”
 

 
The children got a bit distracted as they chatted.
 

 
Even someone as clever as Zhao Zai forgot that “Jiang Dang can’t bathe by himself” was just an extreme scenario suggested by another child, with no real evidence to back it up.
 

 
...
 

 
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Zhao Zai had somehow taken on the invisible task of “teaching Jiang Dang to bathe alone.”
 

 
And Jiang Dang didn’t know that, in the minds of the three little ones, he now bore the responsibility of “learning to bathe.”
 

 
For a moment, the audience couldn’t even tell who was worse off.
 

 
To put the younger ones at ease, Zhao Zai was the last to leave.
 

 
She sent them off one by one. Although each child looked back three times as they walked, their steps were light, bouncing and full of energy.
 

 
After sending them off, Zhao Zai visibly relaxed, and gracefully walked over to where Jiang Dang was sitting in the corner, playing on his phone. He had been waiting for her, not rushing or asking when she was going to leave. When she walked over, he immediately put his phone back in his pocket, curling his lips into a smile. “Ready to go home?”
 

 
“Mhm, let’s go.”
 

 
Zhao Zai naturally extended her hand, letting Jiang Dang hold it.
 

 
It didn’t feel like a guardian taking care of a child; it felt more like adopting a lazy big cat.
 

 
“Do you want me to hold your hand?” Jiang Dang asked.
 

 
“Mhm, otherwise I might get lost. I asked the host for a map earlier. It’ll take about three minutes to walk home from here.”
 

 
Look at this child, so sensible.
 

 
Some audience members who couldn’t read maps were already wondering how a child like this would even come into being, so practical!
 

 
At this moment, the program team pulled up the content Jiang Dang had been looking at on his phone earlier—
 

 
He had been checking the map of the park.
 

 
He knew exactly how to get there.
 

 
But Jiang Dang didn’t say anything. When he heard Zhao Zai was going to guide him, he smiled again. “You just need to show me the way.”
 

 
He bent down and gently picked her up, holding her in his arms.
 

 
He was very careful, making sure her delicate little dress wouldn’t show anything.
 

 
Zhao Zai instinctively hugged his neck.
 

 
“I can walk by myself,” she said.
 

 
Jiang Dang replied, “You just focus on showing me the way.”
 

 
Soon, Zhao Zai experienced the joy of being carried. She swung her little legs gently, focusing all her attention on guiding Brother Dang, afraid he might get lost. Jiang Dang knew exactly which way to take at every fork, but still chose to listen to her.
 

 
During this time, Zhao Zai had forgotten part of the way, but Jiang Dang didn’t point it out. Instead, he followed the parts she could remember, and together they slowly found the villa arranged by the host. By then, they were a little later than the other temporary families.
 

 
“Sorry, I remembered the way wrong earlier,” Zhao Zai whispered.
 

 
“You’re tired. It’s normal to make mistakes when you’re tired,” Jiang Dang said, reaching out to gently pat the back of her head. His fingers, usually used for playing guitar and piano, threaded through her soft hair and pressed lightly on her little head. The sensation was soothing and comforting, almost tickling. “Even when I’m not tired, I still make mistakes often.”
 

 
“Is that so…”
 

 
Zhao Zai blinked her eyes.
 

 
After he said that and patted her, her eyelids suddenly grew heavy. Her limbs felt like they were filled with lead. She changed to a more comfortable position, resting her head on his neck. She hadn’t slept well in the afternoon due to the disturbances, and when she saw the other children looking scared and unsettled, she forced herself to stay alert, putting on a bright and strong face in front of others.
 

 
She asked them if they were scared.
 

 
No one asked her if she was tired or wanted to sleep.
 

 
So what if she was tired?
 

 
Zhao Zai still felt she shouldn’t make mistakes. Her stubbornness kicked in, and she mumbled in Jiang Dang’s ear, “I won’t make mistakes again next time, I’m sorry…”
 

 
“If you live with me, I’ll make mistakes often. We’ll balance each other out, and you can consider this as prepaying for one chance to forgive me.”
 

 
Zhao Zai didn’t understand those eight words.
 

 
Her small head grew even heavier, and Jiang Dang patted her back, making her lie more comfortably on the bed.
 

 
Jiang Dang held the little girl with one arm and used the other to open the villa’s door by inputting the code. He hesitated for a moment at the light switch, but then chose to stand still in the entrance for a while, letting their eyes adjust to the darkness before walking further in. Once he found the children’s room, he placed Zhao Zai on the bed, helping her sit up, even though she was already half-asleep.
 

 
Zhao Zai could hardly keep her eyes open. Without thinking, she reached out for the pillow she had been resting on earlier, which led to her grabbing Jiang Dang’s head instead.
 

 
“…”
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head, about to lie down, but Jiang Dang quickly caught her. “At least take off your shoes before sleeping.”
 

 
He kept the position with her holding his head and awkwardly took off her glossy little leather shoes and white socks. Afterward, he thought for a moment, stuffed the socks into the shoes, and placed them by the bed. Then, he managed to free his head from her grasp and laid her flat in the bed, covering her with the blanket tightly.
 

 
He placed a cup of warm water on the bedside table.
 

 
This time, no one would wake her up while she was sleeping.
 

 
It had been a long time since the broadcast started. Some audience members who were just watching for the novelty had already left, waiting for the edited version. Only those who treated this variety show as a form of companionship remained, and when they saw this scene, they were amazed by Jiang Dang’s thoughtfulness.
 

 
Oh, and his manager was watching, too.
 

 
The manager was once again wondering if this guy was intentionally performing for him.
 

 
…
 

 
Zhao Zai woke up in the middle of the night, having fallen asleep too early. The cup of fruit-flavored water she had brought earlier came in handy. She opened the lid and drank slowly, soothing her throat and clearing her mind. Her memories from before bed began to return. In a panic, she jumped out of bed, found her slippers, and made her way to the master bedroom in the dark.
 

 
Jiang Dang had light sleep, and he noticed as soon as a little creature crawled into the bed.
 

 
He opened his eyes.
 

 
What met his gaze was a pair of bright, sparkling eyes.
 

 
“You’re awake?” Jiang Dang asked, showing no intention of getting up.
 

 
His voice was groggy from just waking up, with a hoarse edge to it. His eyes were half-closed, and he reached out to pat her head. His hand felt soft, like a plush toy cat, but his hair was a bit messy from sleep. Without realizing it, he started using his fingers to gently comb through the little girl’s hair.
 

 
“Yeah, I’m awake,”
 

 
Zhao Zai said, lying at the edge of the bed. “Brother Dong, did you take a shower before you went to bed? Do you want me to teach you how to take a shower?”
 

 
…
 

 
It could be called the "Confusing Children’s Statement Award" live.
 

 
“No need, I took a shower before bed.”
 

 
“Can you shower by yourself?”
 

 
Zhao Zai was cautious.
 

 
Adults can lie.
 

 
And they’re often better at it than kids, something she had plenty of experience with.
 

 
“I can,” Jiang Dang said, thinking for a moment. “Can’t you?”
 

 
Even if she couldn’t, he couldn’t shower her, it wouldn’t be appropriate.
 

 
He then looked at a doll in the corner, about the same height as Zhao Zai, and said softly, “If you can’t, I can use that teddy bear to show you how to shower.”
 

 
The teddy bear doll, which wasn’t waterproof, had a large question mark on its head.
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head. “I can shower, I’m just worried about you~”
 

 
“Worried about me…”
 

 
Jiang Dang smiled. “I’m fine. If you can sleep again, go ahead and sleep. If you’re hungry, I’ll get up and make you something to eat.”
 

 
Zhao Zai said she wasn’t hungry.
 

 
Just as she finished speaking, her stomach let out a loud growl.
 

 
Physiological hunger doesn’t listen to one’s will. Even though Zhao Zai felt it wasn’t quite right to wake up an adult in the middle of the night to make food for her, as it didn’t seem like something a good child would do… her stomach still growled. Zhao Zai quickly covered her stomach, trying to act casual, and was about to turn around and sneak away, pretending nothing happened, when Jiang Dang, who had turned over and sat up, caught her by the back of her neck.
 

 
Zhao Zai tilted her head up.
 

 
"Go brush your teeth and wash your face, dinner is ready."
 

 
Jiang Dang's voice, still carrying the grogginess of just waking up, was firm and left no room for argument. His slightly grumpy, just-woke-up demeanor only added to the intimidating aura of his villainous face. Zhao Zai weighed the pros and cons and decided it was better to listen to the adult. She obediently went to the bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face. Remembering she hadn’t showered before bed, she called out to Jiang Dang, saying she was going to take a shower. After receiving a simple "Okay," she quickly completed the entire routine.
 

 
After drying her body and wet hair with a large white towel, Zhao Zai put on a brand new set of pajamas and grabbed the railing to look downstairs.
 

 
The kitchen downstairs was lit, with wisps of white steam drifting out.
 

 
The glass door was fogged up, only faintly outlining the figure of a man.
 

 
As if sensing her gaze, Jiang Dang took two steps back and looked up at her.
 

 
"Come downstairs and have some noodles."
# Chapter122
Zhao Zai originally intended to help.
 

 
Although there were servants to handle chores at home, with only her and Brother Dang here, she believed that everyone who ate should contribute. However, when her short legs carried her over to the stove, Jiang Dang gently pressed down on her head.
 

 
"Go sit down."
 

 
"I can help bring the bowls and chopsticks out," Zhao Zai replied seriously.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, "Are you going to walk over, or should I carry you?"
 

 
Zhao Zai stubbornly locked eyes with him for a moment.
 

 
In the end, Jiang Dang handed her a pair of chopsticks and let her take them out.
 

 
The noodles in the small pot were soon cooked.
 

 
Jiang Dang asked if there was anything she didn’t eat. Zhao Zai shook her head. "I’m not picky~"
 

 
That made things easier.
 

 
After Zhao Zai sat down, she turned her head toward the kitchen.
 

 
The rhythmic sound of chopping filled the air as Jiang Dang sliced scallions into segments and sprinkled them into a bowl. Boiling soup poured over the scallions, cooking them instantly. Their fresh green and white hues glistened, giving the dish an appetizing appearance.
 

 
He placed the bowl in front of Zhao Zai.
 

 
There was only one bowl.
 

 
"Aren’t you eating, Brother Dang?" Zhao Zai asked, holding her chopsticks hesitantly.
 

 
The aroma of the broth wafted up with the steam, whetting her appetite. Although she had only been slightly hungry before, the smell pushed her hunger to a new level. After Jiang Dang reassured her that he wasn’t eating, she couldn't resist breaking the half-cooked egg on top of the soup. The golden yolk oozed out like molten lava, coating the noodles. She picked up a large bite of noodles drenched in yolk and slurped them up, savoring the rich, delicious flavor.
 

 
It was hard to eat noodles without making noise.
 

 
Even though Zhao Zai was extremely hungry, she still managed to restrain herself from devouring the food, not opening up her stomach to eat greedily. She ate quietly in the long night, feeling a warmth spread through her hands and feet as she was satisfied. Just as she was immersed in the delicious food, her little head was gently pressed from behind.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused.
 

 
"Keep eating, I'll do my thing."
 

 
She heard Brother Dang’s voice from behind her.
 

 
Jiang Dang was holding a hairdryer. Zhao Zai’s hair, soft and thick like cat fur, couldn’t handle the full force of the blow, so he set the dryer on a low setting to avoid blowing her head off. The warm, yellow light in the dining room bathed his hands—hands that were elegant and graceful, capable of creating many heartfelt songs, and now, they were simply brushing her hair.
 

 
The scene was warm and heartwarming.
 

 
The intelligent AI tried to read Jiang Dang's subconscious, attempting to capture some human-like thoughts to elevate the moment.
 

 
"AI captured Jiang Dang’s inner thoughts…"
 

 
"Captured!"
 

 
Finally, the guy was actually thinking about something.
 

 
The assistant director on night shift was moved to tears.
 

 
Jiang Dang:
 

 
"Which came first, the egg or the chicken?"
 

 
"When is the best time to break the egg yolk in a fried egg?"
 

 
…
 

 
Night shift staff: "..."
 

 
When Jiang Dang thinks, even God is speechless.
 

 
By the time Zhao Zai finished her bowl of noodles, her hair was almost dry. Her long, glossy hair was neatly combed, and the stray strands were tucked behind her small ears, shaped like seashells.
 

 
Jiang Dang gently pinched her ear. "It’s dry now."
 

 
"Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
Zhao Zai picked up her bowl and walked to the kitchen sink, willingly starting to wash the dishes. She had almost no experience with housework, but this task didn’t need any special training—it just depended on how serious one was. She held the sponge with her small hands, scrubbing vigorously, cleaning every spot, even the little grooves at the bottom of the bowl. She only placed it in the sterilizing cabinet after it was thoroughly cleaned.
 

 
Zhao Zai wiped her hands dry.
 

 
Still not feeling sleepy after eating, Zhao Zai thought for a moment and then walked over to ask the elder: "Brother Dang, can I walk around the yard for a bit? My stomach feels a bit too full~"
 

 
"I’ll go with you."
 

 
Jiang Dang took her hand, which was still cold from washing the dishes, and wrapped his large hand around her small, pale hand, warming it for a moment. "Your hands are so cold."
 

 
Her fingertips, which had turned slightly red from the water, were gradually warmed up.
 

 
"I’m a little jealous."
 

 
"Jealous of what?" Zhao Zai asked, puzzled.
 

 
"If my hands were as cold as yours," Jiang Dang mused as he stared at her little face, "I could freeze your face."
 

 
!!!
 

 
Zhao Zai immediately became alert.
 

 
Unfortunately, after just cooking the noodles and drying the little one's hair with the blow dryer, Jiang Dang’s hands were warm, and he didn’t have the chance to freeze her. Instead, he held her hand and walked with her in the yard, with her in front and him following behind.
 

 
Under the moonlit night, everything was silent.
 

 
This didn’t seem like the time for a child to be awake and out, but Zhao Zai inexplicably felt a bit excited. Her little face was warm, and she felt like she could take on ten people. Her steps quickened, as if she were a little dog frolicking around.
 

 
Jiang Dang watched her small back, thinking to himself:
 

 
"Such a small one..."
 

 
"If I kicked her, she'd probably fly far."
 

 
…
 

 
Night-shift assistant director: "Is this content fit to be broadcast?"
 

 
"Ah," said the staff, "it seems like his agent has already given up on managing him."
 

 
There's no saving him now, just let him be.
 

 
Zhao Zai was hopping around joyfully, but the night road was unpredictable. In a moment of over-excitement, she nearly tripped and fell. However, Jiang Dang, quick on his feet, caught her in the middle of the fall, lifting her up like a little chick. Suspended in the air, Zhao Zai kicked her legs a little, hanging from his strong arm, her face trying hard to appear calm after being startled: "Thank you, Brother Dang."
 

 
She really tried hard to appear composed.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at her.
 

 
Just as the night-shift assistant director thought Jiang Dang might comfort the little girl, Jiang Dang said something completely random:
 

 
"You..."
 

 
"You kind of look like a weeble."
 

 
?
 

 
Zhao Zai’s small head was full of confusion.
 

 
What nonsense is this grown-up talking?
 

 
Zhao Zai jumped down from his arm.
 

 
After walking off the meal, she held Jiang Dang’s hand and headed back to the villa. She brushed her teeth and washed her face on her own. Before going to bed, she thanked her guardian:
 

 
"Thank you for making me supper."
 

 
It was really delicious.
 

 
Zhao Zai licked her lips in her mind.
 

 
"Mm, due to time constraints, otherwise I could’ve made it better," Jiang Dang said, sounding a bit regretful. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the chance to prepare his specialty molecular gastronomy dish—molecular cuisine usually takes a lot of time to prepare. Seeing that the little one was so hungry earlier, he had to settle for a simple dish instead, one that didn’t show off his culinary skills at all. "Sorry for making you eat this."
 

 
"No need to apologize, you can make it again next time~"
 

 
Unaware that she had narrowly avoided trouble, Zhao Zai tugged at Jiang Dang’s finger.
 

 
"Do you want me to tell you a bedtime story?"
 

 
Perhaps it was the warm soup noodles and the timely hug that helped Zhao Zai lower her guard. She blinked her eyes, tucked the blanket corner, and quietly said the truth: "I want to hear one.”
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
...
 

 
The night-shift assistant director suddenly became energized.
 

 
This was Jiang Dang’s bedtime story!
 

 
If turned into an audio recording, it would definitely be a popular selling point.
 

 
Just imagine, that low, gentle voice, softly narrating a hypnotic story in the quiet night, surely making one feel safe and drift off to sleep...
 

 
Jiang Dang sat by the bed. The small nightlight illuminated his side profile, making his already deep features appear even more striking and handsome. The shadow cast across the other side of his face looked like a dark mask, adding a sinister charm to his beauty.
 

 
Not only could he sing, but his voice also had a slight radio-like quality, captivating and smooth, weaving a story as if calling from some ancient source:
 

 
“Perhaps you’ve heard of Cthulhu?”
 

 
Zhao Zai: "I haven't."
 

 
The night-shift assistant director was stunned.
 

 
"It’s the ancient ruler, an indescribable terror…”
 

 
His voice was low and smooth, almost seductive.
 

 
When Jiang Dang told stories, the imagery and emotional depth were so powerful that Zhao Zai clutched the blanket and shivered. But she was also indeed tired, and despite her unease, she soon drifted into an anxious sleep…
 

 
In her dream, there was a giant octopus and countless eyes. She didn’t dare to look at anything.
 

 
Because gazing into Cthulhu’s eyes would drive one mad.
 

 
Zhao Zai’s face, pressed against the pillow while lying on her side, looked like a little rice cake. She was unsure of what she dreamed about, but her eyelashes and lips trembled slightly. Jiang Dang saw that she had fallen asleep and felt proud of how well he had taken care of her.
 

 
Sigh, maybe he had a talent for being a babysitter.
 

 
Meanwhile, the night-shift staff unanimously agreed that he must belong to some evil cult.
 

 
The next morning, Zhao Zai woke up early and, after quickly brushing her teeth and washing her face, sneakily made her way to Jiang Dang’s room to quietly sit and wait for him to wake up. She was alone in the children's room, always feeling as though mysterious eyes were watching her. But she didn’t dare to investigate, because in Brother Dang’s story, everyone who sought out that mysterious force was eventually driven mad by its terrifying power.
 

 
When Jiang Dang opened his eyes, he saw a neatly dressed little girl sitting up straight on the couch beside the bed.
 

 
She looked like a porcelain doll from a dollhouse.
 

 
"Up so early?"
 

 
Jiang Dang’s handsome face broke into a smile he thought was friendly. "Did you want to hear the continuation of last night’s story?"
 

 
Zhao Zai shook her head rapidly, like a rattle.
 

 
...
 

 
The production team never expected that Jiang Dang and Zhao Zai’s pairing would go so smoothly.
 

 
They had originally thought there would be trouble on the first night.
 

 
But it turned out Jiang Dang was quite good at taking care of children.
 

 
Telling a kid a terrifying story about Cthulhu as a bedtime fairytale is a bit inhumane.
 

 
What about the other groups?
 

 
Zhang Shi and Xiao Quan spent a perfectly calm night.
 

 
Long Fei had no patience for taking care of children, so it was almost always Xie Zihan who was busy running around. When it came time for the bedtime story, Xie Zihan told Jia Jia the story of ‘Cinderella’, while Long Fei commented, "Of course, when there's a stepmother, there will be a stepfather too. Men can't be trusted."
 

 
"Men can't be trusted!" Jia Jia repeated, mimicking her.
 

 
Xie Zihan was a bit flustered: "Sister Fei, it's not good to say that in front of the kids..."
 

 
"What's wrong with that? They’ll need to know sooner or later. Men can’t be trusted!"
 

 
Jia Jia was curious: "So what can we trust?"
 

 
"Trust others, you’re a princess. Trust yourself, and you’re a queen."
 

 
...
 

 
The most chaotic group was Ye Xiaofan and Noah.
 

 
Noah was used to being a pampered young master, always having others take care of him, and Ye Xiaofan wasn’t much better. At school, he either ordered takeout or ate at the cafeteria and had never cooked before. The two of them arrived early at the villa, and after staring at each other for a while, Noah declared he was hungry.
 

 
After some thought, Ye Xiaofan found two bowls of instant noodles in the kitchen.
 

 
Noah turned his head and said he didn’t want that.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan: "Then what do you want to eat?"
 

 
Noah glanced at the kitchen, which was stocked with ingredients: "I want to eat a proper meal."
 

 
This seemed like a reasonable request.
 

 
Thinking she was here for a variety show and couldn’t look too incompetent, Ye Xiaofan reluctantly Googled some recipes while trying to make a dinner that was mediocre in taste, appearance, and smell. He didn’t like it himself, but at least it was homemade. After tasting a bite, it was passable—not undercooked, just a bit salty.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan called him to wash his hands and eat, but Noah sat in the corner without saying a word.
 

 
He glanced at the food: "I’m not eating this."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan picked up two pieces of stir-fried meat in front of him and ate them: "It’s not bad, though it’s not great either."
 

 
Noah put on a stern face, didn’t stay in the living room, and went straight to the game room to play with toys.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan watched his back and raised his voice: "Aren’t you eating?"
 

 
Noah muttered, "I’m not hungry, I’m not eating!"
 

 
After saying that, Noah distractedly played with his toys, waiting for the adults to bring a bowl and coax him to eat. This was his usual eating routine at home—if someone coaxed him, he could force himself to eat a little.
 

 
But after waiting and waiting, all he heard was Ye Xiaofan enjoying his meal in the living room, followed by the sound of him cleaning up the dishes.
 

 
Noah peeked his head out and looked around.
 

 
Where were the traces of the meal in the living room? There was only an instant noodle bowl. Ye Xiaofan had been too lazy to clean up, maybe thinking he’d want some later. The bowls were ceramic, and he didn’t want Noah to break them and hurt himself—Ye Xiaofan was a normal adult, so he considered safety, but coaxing someone to eat? That never crossed his mind.
 

 
After realizing that Ye Xiaofan had no intention of coaxing him, Noah suddenly lost interest in the toy in his hands.
 

 
In frustration, he threw the toy against the wall and sulked, thinking:
 

 
"I don’t care."
 

 
"I’m not hungry anyway. Those dishes looked disgusting."
 

 
Since it was the first day, the production team didn’t assign any interaction tasks to the guests. The idea was to allow the guests, both big and small, to relax and bond without the pressure of tasks. Seeing there were no tasks, Ye Xiaofan decided to spend his time looking for video game consoles in the villa. Sure enough, he found a Switch, a Wii, and a PS5, among others. He did ask Noah if he wanted to play, but Noah, crossing his arms, snorted, "They're all games I’m tired of playing."
 

 
Well then, I’ll just play by myself.
 

 
So, Ye Xiaofan played happily, feeling at ease.
 

 
However, Noah, who had been in a good mood at first, started getting angrier as the night went on.
 

 
"This adult won't even make me eat, and doesn’t care about my game time. He’s so bad!"
 

 
By the next day, Noah asked the host if he could switch parents!
 

 
The host was in a difficult position, as there was no precedent for this.
 

 
The other two kids, upon hearing this, were also reluctant. After all, they had finally gotten comfortable with their own parents. Though Xiao Quan liked the way Brother Fan danced, he had started to rely on Uncle Zhang Shi.
 

 
Seeing that no one else wanted to, Noah’s mood seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.
 

 
He pressed his lips tightly together, looking as though he was about to cry.
 

 
The production team quickly came up with a temporary solution: they would pair Noah and Xiao Zhao together and have them be in one family unit.
 

 
After all, based on Jiang Dang's performance on the first night, he seemed to know how to cook.
 

 
The host asked, “Is that okay?”
 

 
Xiao Zhao didn’t have the same resistance to Noah as the other kids. She looked at Noah, who was clearly on the verge of tears, and agreed. When it came to Jiang Dang, the host gave him a frantic look, fearing he might refuse.
 

 
If he refused, Noah's pride would really shatter.
 

 
The agent, watching this scene unfold on the live broadcast after waking up, couldn’t help but sigh, realizing the host still didn’t fully understand Jiang Dang.
 

 
Sure enough, when Jiang Dang saw the host’s signals, he looked confused. “You…”
 

 
The host responded, “Hmm?”
 

 
Jiang Dang asked, “Is your eye bothering you?”
 

 
The agent just wanted to say—
 

 
It’s a basic move, don’t laugh.
 

 
Fortunately, after understanding the host’s intentions, Jiang Dang not only agreed but did so enthusiastically. He looked at Noah with admiration: "Perfect, I was just thinking of making a nice lunch, and it’s such a waste for only one person to hear last night’s story. You’ve come at just the right time."
 

 
Upon hearing "last night’s story," the usually composed Xiao Zhao couldn’t help but nervously glance at Brother Dang:
 

 
"Actually, Brother Ye Xiaofan is really nice, why don’t you…"
 

 
"I want him!" Noah immediately cut in.
 

 
Hearing that Xiao Zhao seemed reluctant for Jiang Dang to take him, and following the principle of "what the enemy rejects is what I’ll fight for," Noah quickly stepped forward with his demand and looked at Xiao Zhao with a victorious gaze, ignoring her implied warning to "run away.”
 

 
Xiao Zhao was speechless: "Fine."
 

 
Brother Dang's cooking is delicious, and it should be enough to make up for the psychological trauma caused by the stories he told.
 

 
Noah, the young master, was full of confidence and kept pressing on:
 

 
"I didn’t eat last night, and now I’m so hungry! I want him to only cook for me. You can eat the food that guy made. Once you’ve eaten it, you’ll understand why I won’t eat his cooking."
 

 
It was getting close to noon, and the live broadcast of the variety show was slowly attracting viewers.
 

 
[This little brat’s looks are proportional to how annoying he is.]
 

 
[He’s obviously been spoiled.]
 

 
[Why is he bullying Xiao Zhao? Xiao Zhao, beat him up! Jiang Dang couldn’t even beat Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
...
 

 
What the audience hoped to see—Xiao Zhao pinning the young master to the ground and beating him up—was obviously not going to happen at this stage.
 

 
Before facing major changes, Xiao Zhao was a well-mannered young lady who set high standards for herself. She tolerated Noah’s behavior with a glance, ready to argue with him, but when she saw Ye Xiaofan’s frustrated expression, she chose to take care of the other adult’s pride instead. "You want to eat the food Brother Dang made, right?"
 

 
"Mm-hmm."
 

 
"Then I also want to eat the food Brother Ye made."
 

 
Xiao Zhao gave Jiang Dang a look to show she wasn’t rejecting him; it was just a temporary measure. Then she walked over to Ye Xiaofan, tugging at his sleeve to show encouragement. Ye Xiaofan felt both frustrated and hurt—didn’t he enjoy eating instant noodles? If it weren’t for taking care of this little brat, would he really need to spend time searching on Baidu and slaving away in the kitchen?
 

 
Looking down, he saw the clear, almost translucent deer-like eyes of the little girl, and his heart melted.
 

 
"Okay, okay, I’ll make whatever you want to eat!"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan squatted down and hugged the little angel.
 

 
Xiao Zhao hadn’t expected this, and her face showed an almost breathless expression. She forced herself to pat his head. "Good..."
 

 
Sigh, adults are really hard to take care of!
 

 
Seeing everything under his control, Noah raised his chin with a victorious smile.
 

 
This was the situation he was most familiar with.
 

 
All the adults were revolving around him, catering to his needs, focusing on him, and treating him like the center of attention.
 

 
Jiang Dang looked down at him and asked:
 

 
"So, are you going to finish the food I make for you?"
 

 
Feeling victorious, Noah was in a great mood and patted his chest, promising:
 

 
"I’ve been starving all night; I can eat a whole cow now! As long as it’s not the food he made, I’ll finish it all! If I don’t, I’m a dog!"
 

 
To let the guests show off their cooking skills, the villa was stocked with plenty of ingredients.
 

 
Even the more difficult-to-find ingredients could be delivered by the host within five minutes—after all, it was just the program team adjusting the data, and the ingredient codes were very cheap.
 

 
But the four sardines, eel, nutmeg, pig’s blood, chocolate, and bananas Jiang Dang requested…
 

 
What exactly was he planning to cook?
 

 
Watching Jiang Dang preparing to serve this bratty little young master, Ye Xiaofan’s initial hostility toward him not only dissipated but even gave way to a sense of shared camaraderie. “I didn’t expect you to look so unreliable, yet you actually know how to cook?”
 

 
“Basic survival skills for studying abroad,” Jiang Dang replied.
 

 
Wearing an apron, he exuded a homely vibe. The steam rising from the pot softened his silhouette, adding an air of reliability.
 

 
“I studied in the UK for a while.”
# Chapter123
“How long is this going to take?”
 

 
Noah, who hadn’t eaten dinner last night, was so hungry that his stomach was pressing against his back. Though Ye Xiaofan had made a quick breakfast this morning, Noah still held a grudge against him for not inviting him to play the game (he’d only invited him once). He thought to himself that unless Ye Xiaofan begged him, he wouldn’t eat a single bite...
 

 
In the end, he really didn’t get any food.
 

 
“Man dies for money, child dies for food,” Noah decided to lower his proud head just a little. It was impossible for him to bow down to Ye Xiaofan, who he held a grudge against, but he could at least show some favor to Jiang Dang, whom he’d stolen from Tong Zhao. Even if he didn’t ask, he’d still obediently eat the food this time.
 

 
There was no choice, he was too hungry.
 

 
Noah wandered around the kitchen, the smell of food drifting to his nose, stirring the hunger inside him. His stomach growled, and he couldn’t hold back any longer. He reluctantly went over to Jiang Dang to hurry him up.
 

 
“I need some time to cook,” Jiang Dang said without being moved. “If you can’t wait, you can eat what Ye Xiaofan made.”
 

 
“I’m not eating what he made.”
 

 
Noah snorted coldly.
 

 
Though he snorted, upon hearing Jiang Dang say that, Noah still held back and sat at the dining table, playing with his phone and waiting. Every now and then, he would glance toward the kitchen, but all he could see was the rising steam.
 

 
At that moment, what kept him going wasn’t just his pride.
 

 
It was also Jiang Dang’s cooking skills.
 

 
Noah had observed Ye Xiaofan cooking last night.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was squinting at the recipe on his phone while stirring the food, his brows furrowed. He looked at the dish like it was an enemy. When adding the seasoning, he hesitated. Could something good come out of this? Noah wasn’t holding out any hope. It looked like slop, and even though Ye Xiaofan was eating it happily, Noah only thought that he’d never had anything better.
 

 
But then he looked at Jiang Dang.
 

 
After putting on an apron, Jiang Dang looked like one of those skilled men on Douyin, confidently and gracefully cooking. His movements were smooth and practiced, showing that he was a seasoned cook. He knew exactly how much seasoning to use, never foolishly measuring salt with a cup. And as for the dish...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan’s was just home cooking.
 

 
Tomato scrambled eggs, stir-fried green peppers with shredded pork—Noah was sick of that.
 

 
But when he looked at Jiang Dang, he saw him flattening a dough disc and placing it into a container, shaping it into a pie crust.
 

 
Though he didn’t know exactly what Jiang Dang was making, it clearly looked very fancy.
 

 
It was food Noah had never seen before.
 

 
Looking at the ingredients, there was also chocolate and bananas.
 

 
Noah liked both of those, and then there was eel. He was craving Japanese grilled eel rice, just thinking about it made him hungry.
 

 
Noah kicked his legs, glancing over at Tong Zhao beside him.
 

 
She wasn’t on her phone, holding a notebook and doing homework. This was something she had asked the host for—she was worried about falling behind in her studies, but she wouldn’t let it interfere with the show or playing games. She would study during breaks.
 

 
Listen, is that even something a child would say?
 

 
Noah found it hard to believe.
 

 
His own parents had also wanted him to bring his homework, saying that subconsciously he should maintain a competitive spirit, but unfortunately, the little master had torn up his homework on the spot, saying he wouldn’t do it. Noah sneaked a glance at the problems Tong Zhao was working on...
 

 
Shit.
 

 
He couldn’t understand it.
 

 
Noah was secretly angry:
 

 
“You think doing this will make the adults think you’re obedient and like you more?”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him: “Are you talking to me?”
 

 
“Well, who else?”
 

 
“How strange,” Tong Zhao said in confusion, “Even if I don’t do my homework, the adults still like me a lot.”
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao was so cute and confident!
 

 
The comments flooded with laughter, especially from Tong Zhao’s fans, who kept agreeing, saying that no matter what Tong Zhao did or didn’t do, Mommy and Daddy always loved her the most. While Noah was still stunned, Ye Xiaofan came out with a big smile, holding two dishes: “Dinner’s ready. Do you want to finish your homework first?”
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head, jumping off her chair: “I’ll go serve the food for Brother Ye, wait for me, Brother~”
 

 
...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan, who had been ignored all day by Noah the day before and criticized by the brat in the morning, was now warmed to the core. AI detected his current feelings—
 

 
"So kids can be this cute too, I take back everything I said about human children being little terrors. I will always love Tong Zhao! Ah, her little voice calling me ‘brother’ is so sweet, sob, I really want a little sister. I should’ve let my mom have a second child last time..."
 

 
At this moment, Ye Xiaofan glanced at Noah sitting next to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"...Never mind, what if she has a little brother instead? The risk is too great."
 

 
"Can I take Tong Zhao home after the show?"
 

 
His heartfelt words about only wanting a little sister and not a little brother made the audience laugh.
 

 
Normally, words like this would spark rumors.
 

 
But this is little Tong Zhao, who is miles away from the idea of early romance. Even the fans who adore Ye Xiaofan and consider him the perfect boyfriend wouldn't be jealous of a little loli. Besides, when their older brother was ignored by Noah and bullied by the brat, they all suppressed their anger, feeling sorry for their brother. Now, seeing him so healed and acting like a silly big brother, they even felt grateful to Tong Zhao.
 

 
If it weren’t for Tong Zhao, Ye Xiaofan would have been bullied by the brat to the point of questioning his life.
 

 
After all, the production team hadn’t tried to pair up Tong Zhao with any other male guests in a romantic way. The fans could sense the direction of the show and had accepted the sibling dynamic for the two of them.
 

 
A sweet and obedient little sister was simply impossible to feel resentful toward.
 

 
However…
 

 
[? You can't just take Tong Zhao away, she belongs to everyone!]
 

 
[Want to take away my cloud-raised little one?? There’s something seriously wrong with you!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is bearing a workload of homework that she shouldn’t even have to deal with at her age. By the way, do kids like this who voluntarily do their homework even exist in real life?]
 

 
Tong Zhao seriously served up two bowls of rice.
 

 
One bowl was a little more full, piled into a nice-looking pyramid shape, and the other was slightly less, about two-thirds full. Ye Xiaofan watched her work with her short legs, moving back and forth like a little Q-version character in a mobile game. His internal balance between “helping her” and “watching her a little longer” swung back and forth, with both choices feeling equally attractive.
 

 
Although her legs were short, Tong Zhao worked quickly and efficiently. She placed the fuller bowl in front of Ye Xiaofan: “I’m done, Brother Ye, eat.”
 

 
“Alright, thank you.”
 

 
Ye Xiaofan took the bowl, which was warm to the touch.
 

 
But it wasn’t just rice in that bowl—
 

 
It was the love of his little sister for him!
 

 
This time, in order to impress his little sister, Ye Xiaofan worked extra hard. Compared to yesterday, he had made some progress. The food smelled rich and savory, the twice-cooked pork stir-fried to the perfect color, and the half-fat, half-lean pork gleaming with enticing oil. What touched the audience the most, however, was the small bowl of stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers placed in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This small bowl in front of Tong Zhao had only the shredded pork, no green peppers.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan had picked out the peppers just for her while cooking in the kitchen.
 

 
[Ye Xiaofan looks like the most rebellious and arrogant young man in the world, but who knew he could be so thoughtful and warm?]
 

 
[He says he wants a sister like Tong Zhao, but honestly, I wish I had a brother like him!]
 

 
[This is so sweet, and the food looks pretty good too. It's not as bad as the brat says!]
 

 
The two of them chatted and laughed while eating, and the atmosphere was fantastic.
 

 
At the same table, Noah sat there sulking. Every breath he took only made the tempting smell of meat stronger, and his phone had lost its appeal. Even though he was looking through the lens of disdain for Ye Xiaofan, the aroma was still incredibly enticing. He almost wanted to stop breathing, but he also felt that getting up and leaving the table would make him seem weak.
 

 
[I don’t want to eat at all!]
 

 
[Why is Jiang Dang not done yet…]
 

 
[I’m so hungry, why isn’t anyone asking if I want to eat…]
 

 
With a stomach full of grievances, Noah lowered his head, his eyes red and his nose tip tingling, looking like he was about to cry.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan ate heartily, clearly enjoying his meal.
 

 
He felt that all the emotional damage he had suffered from the brat was completely healed by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Plus, he was indeed hungry, so he ate quickly, not even thinking of leaving any food for Noah. After all, Noah said he didn’t want to eat, and Ye Xiaofan felt that he was respecting the kid's wishes, never forcing him to eat – he remembered when he was young, there were times when he felt bad and didn’t want to eat, and his parents would just leave him alone to calm down.
 

 
Just as Noah was on the verge of tears, Jiang Dang’s cool, soft voice, like a heavenly melody, came from the kitchen:
 

 
“It's done. Go serve yourself.”
 

 
“Don’t take too much, one serving is the main dish. The rice is for mixing with the eel jelly.”
 

 
As soon as he heard this, Noah couldn’t hold his pride any longer. He obediently went to serve himself two bowls of rice.
 

 
When he returned with the rice, the dishes Jiang Dang had made were already on the table.
 

 
Noah froze.
 

 
The audience froze too.
 

 
Most of the audience had been thoroughly entertained by Ye Xiaofan and Tong Zhao’s interactions earlier. Jiang Dang’s cooking process had been long and drawn out, and except for his fans, most viewers hadn’t paid much attention to it. But now, when the food was served, it exceeded their expectations—
 

 
A pie.
 

 
On top of the pie were the heads of four sardines.
 

 
Each fish head’s eye had been roasted white, like they were rolling their eyes, looking exactly like the zombies in the zombie movies Noah had watched. Staring at these eight eyes, Noah found himself frozen.
 

 
Only after seeing these four pairs of eyes could one truly understand what it meant to die with one’s eyes wide open.
 

 
Noah’s whole body stiffened.
 

 
Jiang Dang took off his apron, his movements casual and graceful. He glanced at the rice Noah had served and was satisfied with his obedience. He speared one of the sardine heads with a fork and placed it into Noah’s smaller bowl of rice: “Eat.”
 

 
?
 

 
Is this even edible?
 

 
Can it really be eaten?
 

 
Noah shuddered. He really wanted to throw a tantrum and refuse to eat.
 

 
But the man who made this terrifying dish was sitting right across from him, his expression cold and indifferent.
 

 
Unlike the more easily understood Ye Xiaofan, Jiang Dang, known for being a professional villain, was full of mysterious, inscrutable qualities. His deep-set eyes were cold and menacing, not someone you could easily mess with. And let's not forget his graceful but chilling way of speaking.
 

 
Noah looked up at Jiang Dang, then down at the fish head assigned to his bowl.
 

 
It felt...
 

 
Equally terrifying on both sides!
 

 
He also remembered what he'd said earlier, that if he didn’t finish, he would be a dog…
 

 
With a stiff upper lip, Noah pushed the fish head to the side of the bowl.
 

 
[Hmm, I’ll eat this later.]
 

 
[I'll try the other dishes first!]
 

 
Noah was so hungry; he felt like everything would taste good now.
 

 
If it weren’t for that fish head looking so scary, he probably could have eaten it.
 

 
"Which one is the eel?" he asked.
 

 
Jiang Dang motioned toward the porcelain plate on the right with a slight tilt of his chin.
 

 
The dish on the porcelain plate didn’t look like the eel Noah knew.
 

 
The eel Noah recognized was dark brown, glossy with soy sauce, and when cut, the flesh was white and tender. But this fish on the plate, though white, looked a bit strange, its flesh wrapped in a translucent gelatinous layer...
 

 
The live stream’s comments quickly filled with special bullet screens.
 

 
All of them condensed into eight words:
 

 
Quick, quick, quick, quick
 

 
Run, run, run, run
 

 
Noah gathered his courage and picked up a piece. The eel jelly trembled and landed on the rice. He quickly shoveled two bites of rice into his mouth, but the expected rich flavor didn’t come. Instead, the slippery and cool texture made him feel like he might vomit.
 

 
It wasn’t overly fishy, but it had a slight lingering fishiness, and the taste was very subtle.
 

 
Although the audience didn’t get to eat it, from the look of Noah’s scrunched-up face…
 

 
[People on diets thank Jiang Dang.]
 

 
"If you don’t like that, you can try the black pudding," Jiang Dang said softly.
 

 
At the mention of black pudding, Noah’s eyes lit up.
 

 
He’d had pudding before, and it was sweet and delicious.
 

 
Remembering the chocolate he had seen among the ingredients earlier, Noah lowered his guard against the dark, mysterious item. It must taste like chocolate! He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth, his face scrunching up again in disgust.
 

 
[Can someone please tell me what this black pudding really is?]
 

 
[There are sausages with pig’s blood in them; you can imagine they taste like our pig’s blood.]
 

 
[Is it hard to eat?]
 

 
[It’s not exactly bad, but kids probably won’t like it.]
 

 
Noah gritted his teeth and ate bite after bite.
 

 
The taste was so strange, and the fish head with its fish eyes was terrifying. His eyelids reddened, and his eyelashes trembled...
 

 
Even though he was a rebellious child who usually didn’t care about anything, this moment—forcing himself to eat strange food out of pride despite being scared—still tugged at the hearts of many viewers. Some even urged the production team to stop him from eating. The production team explained with white text that the food Jiang Dang made was not only very safe but also rich in nutritional value, so it was absolutely fine for kids to eat.
 

 
As Noah ate, he finally couldn’t hold back and tears dropped down.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan noticed: “... Are you crying?”
 

 
“Ah,” Jiang Dang answered before Noah could: “It must be because I made it so delicious, it made you cry from the deliciousness.”
 

 
The bullet screen quickly filled with a lot of question marks.
 

 
It was as though Jiang Dang was the kind of man who could speak so quickly that the question marks couldn’t keep up with his speed.
 

 
Noah finished his meal with difficulty.
 

 
Jiang Dang, on the other hand, ate with great enjoyment, relaxing and at ease, showing no sign that he had made some terrifying dark cuisine. It seemed he was really used to eating this kind of food and didn’t find anything wrong with it.
 

 
Noah, with tears in his eyes, thought:
 

 
[Does he think I’m a bad kid and is doing this on purpose?]
 

 
Then he looked up and saw that Jiang Dang not only enjoyed his meal but also refilled his bowl.
 

 
Noah felt like he had been struck by lightning.
 

 
[This big brother is really too scary!]
 

 
The bullet screen quickly congratulated Noah for realizing the truth.
 

 
However, Noah had originally said he would "swap parents." Although they were under the same roof, his parents had now been replaced by Jiang Dang. So, he could only watch Ye Xiaofan and Xiao Zhao play normal games, while he secretly glanced at Jiang Dang…
 

 
Noah really wanted to act tough.
 

 
But in front of this man, he felt a bit weak, as if a mouse had encountered a cat.
 

 
Jiang Dang sat on the couch and waved for him to come over.
 

 
The man, full and satisfied, stretched his long legs with ease. His thin lips curved into a smile that seemed both present and absent, looking so attractive it made people lower their guard.
 

 
“Would you like to listen to a story?”
 

 
His voice carried a soft warmth, like when he occasionally showed mercy and wrote sweet, cheesy love songs that became popular as background music for many TikTok users. This warm voice captivated Noah’s fragile little heart.
 

 
[Although... listening to a story seems a little cheesy…]
 

 
[But it’s not that bad.]
 

 
Noah awkwardly sat down next to Jiang Dang. "If it's just for me to hear, then I'll listen."
 

 
Jiang Dang glanced at Xiao Zhao, who was having a great time playing with Ye Xiaofan, and smiled with a hint of regret.
 

 
"Alright, I'll only say it for you to hear.”
# Chapter124
Fifteen minutes had passed.
 

 
When Zhao Zai and Ye Xiaofan returned to the living room, sweaty from playing with the motion-sensing game console, they were greeted by a strange sight—
 

 
The usually cool and composed young master, who had managed to hold out despite being hungry all night, was tightly clutching the sofa cushion on his lap. His eyes and the tip of his nose were red, as if he were trying hard to hold back tears.
 

 
Earlier, Zhao Zai had been playing the role of a cat demon in the game, and now, she was even more lively than usual, letting go of her usual formal demeanor. She peeked into the living room, casually meowing as if to intentionally act cute, and in that single "meow," countless viewers' hearts melted. The barrage was flooded with "awsl" (a shorthand for "I’m in love").
 

 
But it was that sudden "meow" that unexpectedly broke Noah’s last shred of rationality.
 

 
He threw the pillow aside, jumped off the sofa, and while running, he wailed loudly, "Wah... I... I want to go home... Wuuu... I don’t want you guys, don’t kill me..."
 

 
Ye Xiaofan stared in disbelief at Jiang Dang, sitting on the sofa. "Did you hit him?"
 

 
"No," Jiang Dang innocently looked back at him.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan thought the same.
 

 
The only thing Jiang Dang had to do with violence was being slapped by a female celebrity...
 

 
Who was that female celebrity again? It seemed like part of his memory had been clouded or erased, Ye Xiaofan couldn't recall. After pondering for a while, he gave up on trying to remember. "Damn it, I'm no good at comforting kids."
 

 
"I’ll go," Zhao Zai sighed as she left.
 

 
...
 

 
After Zhao Zai left, Ye Xiaofan puzzled, "What did you do to him? He’s crying so badly.”
 

 
"I told him a bedtime story."
 

 
Jiang Dang's gaze was clear, and Ye Xiaofan could almost sense a hint of "what did the child do wrong" in his expression. But his intuition told him that the blame squarely fell on Jiang Dang. There was no one else to blame. He was suspicious and asked, "Really?"
 

 
"Really."
 

 
Jiang Dang tilted his head slightly.
 

 
The barrage quickly added a caption:
 
"What bad intentions can a psychopath have?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan almost believed him. He asked what kind of scary bedtime story he had told.
 

 
"It was Stephen King's novel ‘The Mist’. Well, it was more of an adaptation. It would take too long to tell the entire story, but when I was studying in the UK, I always used his books as bedtime reading, reading them over and over again. When I thought of a story to tell, this one came to mind first."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a gentle smile: "Do you want to hear it?"
 

 
Ye Xiaofan looked at his smile, almost mesmerized, and mindlessly nodded.
 

 
By the time he finished listening to Jiang Dang’s story, Ye Xiaofan felt dazed.
 

 
How to explain it?
 

 
It wasn’t exactly a very scary story, but the overwhelming sense of despair, helplessness, and mysterious terror, along with Jiang Dang’s soft voice, fit together perfectly. The two sentences he spoke slowly drew the listener into that foggy, monster-filled world: "The most absurd part is that the protagonist felt there was no escape. Dying at the hands of the monster was painful and humiliating. In his desperation, after ending his own family’s suffering, he… suddenly found that rescue really had arrived? This ending is so soul-crushing, so mind-bending. Can this kind of content even be aired?"
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel Ye Xiaofan’s unease.
 

 
Forget about bedtime stories—if he heard this kind of story during the day, he would probably be so disturbed that he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.
 

 
Jiang Dang actually used that as bedtime reading material!
 

 
There were so many things to criticize that Ye Xiaofan couldn’t even process them all at once. He only managed to come up with one comment: "Jiang Dang, sometimes... your voice kind of sounds like tentacles."
 

 
Jiang Dang gave him a smile, as if he had received a compliment.
 

 
On the other side, the rebellious young master Noah was at his limit.
 

 
He instinctively retreated into a dark, secluded corner where he felt safe, biting his arm to stifle his sobs. His tears flowed in large drops, and his mind was filled with all sorts of grotesque and terrifying creatures, lurking everywhere.
 

 
Jiang Dang felt that his skills at taking care of children had improved.
 

 
Last night, when he told Tong Zhao a bedtime story, it was very rigid and straightforward. Today, he had refined his storytelling technique, switching to a second-person narrative that was more immersive, with interactive questions like, “You hurried into a supermarket in a panic. The cashier has been facing away from you for a long time, and even after hearing your footsteps, doesn’t turn around. Do you want to ask them what’s going on around here?” This technique aimed to enhance the sense of immersion for the child.
 

 
The villa was huge, and Noah was fast enough to run at full speed. Tong Zhao had to check each room to find him.
 

 
In the end, she heard faint crying from inside the children’s room closet.
 

 
She opened the door and saw a small figure huddled inside.
 

 
Noah had his face buried in his arm, curled up among the clothes, looking like a mushroom growing in the corner, drooping and wilted.
 

 
"You’re crying," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
"I’m not crying! Go away!" Noah snapped fiercely.
 

 
His "go away" caused some strong reactions in the comments.
 

 
Some felt that Tong Zhao shouldn’t bother with him and should just let him deal with it himself.
 

 
Others thought that although his attitude was bad, he wasn’t throwing tantrums, breaking furniture, or cursing adults. He was just refusing to eat and letting himself go hungry, so he wasn’t really that much of a troublemaker after all.
 

 
[He’s so fierce.]
 

 
[I need to figure out a way to make him stop being so fierce.]
 

 
The smart AI detected Zhao Zai’s thoughts, and the next moment, they heard her clearing her throat and imitating Jiang Dang’s tone with a little sweet voice, asking, “Excuse me, little friend, may I take up some of your time? I’d like to talk to you about our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Cthulhu…”
 

 
“...Waaa!!!”
 

 
At the sound of that tone, Noah’s scalp went numb, and he shrank even more into a tiny ball.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[This is the real devil, isn’t it!!!]
 

 
[Pure evil from the start, this mischievous kid doesn’t stand a chance against them, run!]
 

 
Noah wasn’t just crying out of fear; he also felt very wronged.
 

 
No one here was focusing on him, trying to comfort him or indulge him.
 

 
He had endured his hunger to preserve his dignity, thinking that once he made it through, things would get better. But instead, he was forced to eat strange, unappetizing food, while the little girl next to him got to enjoy normal, tasty meals and seemed so happy about it. All the accumulated grievances, combined with Jiang Dang's terrifying story, finally broke his resolve.
 

 
Zhao Zai furrowed her brow, sensing that the situation wasn’t simple.
 

 
[Actually, I don’t really have experience comforting others…]
 

 
[And I don’t think I’ve ever been comforted either.]
 

 
Amidst the little boy’s cries, Zhao Zai vaguely recalled some memories—someone once praised her for being born strong, with a strong sense of mission in whatever she did, being too strict with herself, unwilling to show weakness to others, and never giving anyone a chance to pity her…
 

 
Who said that again?
 

 
I can't remember.
 

 
This sentence was a bit too complicated for Zhao Zai. After thinking for a while, she felt a headache and decided not to think about it anymore.
 

 
Zhao Zai sighed in her heart, opened her arms, and hugged him.
 

 
A thousand words couldn’t compare to a warm hug~
 

 
“Yes, it’s me, I’m here. If the sky falls, I’ll hold it up. What Jiang Dang said was all fake. I also heard him tell a scary story last night and had a nightmare, so you’re not the only one who’s scared.”
 

 
“…”
 

 
Noah shuddered a bit, lifted his face from his arm, and secretly looked at her.
 

 
“It’s not good. He… he said at the end of the story… that once you hear it, you should never think about it again, because if you think about it, then… it’s….” Noah hiccuped with fear and tears. “Thinking about it is like calling it. If you think about it too much, it’ll notice you. But I… I just can’t stop thinking about it…”
 

 
The little boy anxiously bumped his head against the wardrobe.
 

 
[...]
 

 
[Jiang Dang is truly inhuman, there wasn’t such a setting in the original ‘The Mist’, he added that part himself!]
 

 
[He’s a true genius of ghost stories, how could you not think about it!]
 

 
When Noah hit the wardrobe for the third time, his forehead bumped into something soft.
 

 
[...What did I just bump into?]
 

 
Noah blinked through his teary eyes, confused and puzzled.
 

 
Zhao Zai: “It’s a tentacle.”
 

 
Noah: “!!!”
 

 
"I was joking," Zhao Zai raised his chin with one hand. "It’s my hand."
 

 
Noah saw a delicate, soft hand.
 

 
He bit his lip, remembering how hard he had just bumped into it. "Did I hurt you? What’s wrong with you, why did you put your hand up..."
 

 
His voice, still soft and childish from crying, was gentle and tender.
 

 
"A little, but I didn’t want you to hurt your head either."
 

 
Zhao Zai’s eyes, shining like tiny fireflies in the dark, were clear and enchanting.
 

 
Under her steady gaze, Noah suddenly couldn’t bring himself to say anything harsh.
 

 
His face was burning hot, like it was on fire, just like the first time he saw her.
 

 
Children awaken to love far earlier than adults can imagine. The concept of avoiding early relationships like a plague is unique to Chinese schools, and while there may be some truth to it, human emotions can’t be confined or erased. It’s like a little green sprout quietly pushing up from the earth after the rain, the seed having fallen without notice, and the nourishment unknown. It may never bloom, but it will leave behind a small, beautiful thought for a lifetime.
 

 
Simple, untainted.
 

 
"You... you're silly..."
 

 
Noah grabbed her hand roughly and rubbed it against his palm where he had bumped it earlier.
 

 
He had been too frantic before, not recalling how hard he had hit.
 

 
Zhao Zai wanted to say that the back of his hand, which had slammed into the wardrobe, hurt more, but his rubbing actually hurt too. "It doesn't hurt, let me give you a hug. I'm here for you."
 

 
As she spoke, she patted his back.
 

 
Noah flared up. "Are you treating me like a little kid?"
 

 
Loli, confused: "Aren’t you a little kid?”
 

 
Innocent deer-like eyes fixedly looked at him.
 

 
The adults at home never acknowledged his needs. The only way Noah could get their attention was by crying or throwing a tantrum — because when he became too much of a hassle, the adults had no choice but to take him seriously. If he behaved and listened quietly, his needs, his thoughts, and his feelings would all be ignored.
 

 
Over time, Noah forgot how to communicate with others in a normal way.
 

 
Even in this moment, when warmth filled his chest, Noah couldn’t find the right words to say.
 

 
He thought and thought, countless words passing his lips, only to be swallowed back down.
 

 
Finally, he mumbled an apology in a voice as soft as a mosquito's hum:
 

 
"...Sorry."
 

 
"Sorry for what?"
 

 
"Just..."
 

 
He whispered even more quietly.
 

 
In the big wardrobe, two little children hid, mumbling to each other.
 

 
Noah didn’t like to soften, didn’t like to apologize.
 

 
"I only apologize to you. You’re not allowed to tell anyone else!"
 

 
"And also, you can't bring up this apology with me again."
 

 
He said it in a fierce tone.
 

 
Zhao Zai nodded vigorously.
 

 
"We're speaking so softly in the wardrobe, they definitely can't hear us."
 

 
At this moment, the live stream of "Baby Chaos" had already surpassed 200,000 viewers.
# Chapter125
Once Noah stopped hiccupping from crying, Zhao Zai took him to the bathroom to wash his face.
 

 
Zhao Zai had the mentality of an older sibling, wanting to keep an eye on him even while he washed his face. However, the little boy, his face red with embarrassment, gently pushed her out — this time, it was a soft push without much force, but his attitude was firm: "You go out, I can wash my face by myself."
 

 
Zhao Zai was confused: "Are you going to pee?"
 

 
"I'm not!" Noah loudly denied it. "I went in first, so this place is the men's bathroom now. You're a girl, you can't come in."
 

 
This logic convinced Zhao Zai.
 

 
She indeed couldn't enter the men's bathroom, so she had no choice but to stand outside with a face full of regret.
 

 
The audience watched as the small Zhao Zai stood with her back to the bathroom door, raising her voice: "Be careful washing your face~ Remember to scrub your hands for at least thirty seconds!"
 

 
"I know, you're so annoying!" Noah quickly retorted from inside the bathroom, scrubbing his hands with such speed that his little claws seemed to be on fire.
 

 
Once the shyness passed, Noah came out, now calmer, and quickly whispered in the little girl's ear: "When I said you were annoying, I didn't mean it. I wasn't scolding you!"
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
Zhao Zai raised her hand and touched her ear.
 

 
This child really likes to speak loudly in her ear. She might go deaf.
 

 
---
 

 
Behind the scenes, the production team could clearly see that this temporary family had the highest viewership ratings.
 

 
The combination of Jiang Dang and Tong Zhao was a real attention-grabber.
 

 
Ye Xiaofan was more or less riding their coattails.
 

 
At first, Noah's popularity among the audience was quite low. However, as he interacted more with Zhao Zai, all the data showed that the public's perception of him was improving, and the irrational insults toward him were decreasing significantly.
 

 
The staff on the afternoon shift sighed:
 

 
"Mini version of Zhao Zai is really an angel. Whoever she plays with becomes really likable."
 

 
The female screenwriter watched for a while and said, "I think she’s the type who naturally gets a lot of attention and everyone expects her to do amazing things, but it’s easy to overlook that she’s just a little girl who needs care and love from adults."
 

 
This little girl, who was more self-disciplined and responsible than many adults, naturally reached out and took Noah's hand, leading him back to the living room.
 

 
Perhaps after talking to Jiang Dang for a while, Ye Xiaofan caught the habit of mentioning things best left unsaid, and asked right away: "Where did you go to cry just now?"
 

 
Noah glared at him: "I didn't cry! Do you have any proof?"
 

 
Ah...
 

 
Ye Xiaofan couldn't help but notice his red, swollen eyes.
 

 
Before he could ask again, Zhao Zai quickly took over the conversation: "I was the one who cried, and Noah was comforting me."
 

 
She took small steps forward and tugged at the two big brothers:
 

 
"We’re a family now, right? Let’s all play the game together later~"
 

 
[I'm declaring Zhao Zai as the emotional intelligence ceiling of this family.]
 

 
[Then what about Jiang Dang? Is he the emotional intelligence floor?]
 

 
[He must be the emotional intelligence basement.]
 

 
[He’s so deep, we’ve reached the center of the earth, don’t mention it.]
 

 
As the saying goes, "the rich help the poor." The production team, aiming for balanced attention, decided to add group games and activities for all the guests to participate in. While Zhao Zai excelled at everything, she didn't have the habit of grabbing attention or trying to be the center of focus, and was more than happy to let other children take the spotlight.
 

 
Xiao Quan was timid and often stood quietly on the side, feeling a little down.
 

 
So, the two who most fiercely tried to avoid attention were Jia Jia and Noah. Neither of them was willing to give in, especially when it came to the privilege of playing with Zhao Zai. In the end, it usually resulted in Jia Jia slightly outperforming Noah.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "going to the bathroom together" was a privilege for same-gender children.
 

 
No matter how powerless and angry Noah got, his face turning red...
 

 
He simply couldn’t bring himself to invite Zhao Zai to hold hands and go to the bathroom together.
 

 
Although the younger guests were all quite attached to Zhao Zai, she hadn’t forgotten her original mission. She took time to teach Jiang Dang the simplest ballet steps. Jiang Dang didn’t treat it as just a trick to win her over but studied it seriously, even showing off a small routine at the end of the program.
 

 
Jiang Dang took it seriously, and Zhao Zai, as the little teacher, was quite pleased.
 

 
However, in the live stream, Jiang Dang’s female fans were covering their faces, unable to resist peeking through their fingers. After watching, they couldn’t get enough and even took screenshots as souvenirs.
 

 
When a man wears ballet tights, the size is clearly visible.
 

 
Even when he wasn’t in battle mode, it was still quite astonishing.
 

 
The comments flooded in:
 

 
[Is this content even allowed to air???]
 

 
[If it weren’t for your comments, no one would think that way!]
 

 
[Is Jiang Dang a 1? Is he a 1? Is he a 1?]
 

 
[My big straight man, thank you.]
 

 
Before the program ended, there was a small incident.
 

 
As Noah spent more time interacting with the other two little guests during the activities, they became friends. But whenever he thought about leaving the show and having to travel with his parents again, alone without any playmates, he would feel so sad that he secretly shed tears. He wished he could hide so the adults wouldn’t find him, and the show wouldn’t have to end.
 

 
The production team also invited the real parents of the little guests to watch the live broadcast in the studio. They filmed their reactions and interviewed them about their thoughts.
 

 
In a holographic variety show, where could they hide?
 

 
Moreover, Noah’s hiding spot wasn’t very clever. After a small hint from the production team, Zhao Zai found him again.
 

 
The three little guests promised that they would keep in touch after the show ended and that they would still be good friends.
 

 
After Jia Jia and Xiao Quan spoke, Noah was already wiping his tears.
 

 
Just as Zhao Zai was about to say something, Noah shook his head forcefully: “Don’t be friends!”
 

 
[Advice to the child: Don’t be ungrateful.]
 

 
[Is he turning his back on Zhao?]
 

 
[This kid is ungrateful.]
 

 
Because, on the show, Zhao Zai had been very caring toward him, and the audience jokingly called her "the one who brought an extra son," like a big treasure looking after a little treasure.
 

 
However, the next moment, Noah’s words stunned the audience—
 

 
“After we go out, I want you to be my bride.”
 

 
Noah’s light brown eyes were moist and clear, like a bright sky. He was trembling with nervousness, still carrying the emotional tone of the tears he had shed earlier. His mixed-race face looked as handsome as a prince straight out of a fairytale, worthy of a childhood sweetheart princess.
 

 
And speaking of princesses, is there anyone in this show more suited than Zhao Zai?
 

 
None of the guests noticed that Noah harbored such awkward and inexperienced affection for Zhao Zai. After all, the other two little kids were also very clingy to her, and Noah clearly didn’t understand the complexities of the situation. He thought his dad was cold toward others but kind to his mom, and he wanted to be kind to Zhao Zai too. He wanted her to be his bride.
 

 
“Ah?”
 

 
The little princess was puzzled.
 

 
Now that it was out in the open, Noah, with the air of someone who had nothing to lose, declared to all the adults with a royal confidence: “On the first day, you said you wanted a big plane and a big ship, and I’ll buy them for you in the future, if you become my bride!”
 

 
He said it with such bold, unrestrained confidence.
 

 
However, before his words even settled, Zhao Zai, who had been in a daze, was suddenly picked up by Jiang Dang:
 

 
“It’s time for your ballet lesson, little princess.”
 

 
Noah tilted his head back, and the first thing he saw was the man with a sharp nose and thin lips, who wore a distant, indifferent smile in his deep black eyes. When viewed from the side, his handsome profile resembled that of a cold, aloof fox. The arm he had around Zhao Zai was very conspicuous. Yet, when he turned to look at Zhao Zai, his expression softened into a pure, paternal smile, and Noah felt a surge of irritation.
 

 
[What the hell, I just discovered a love triangle on this variety show.]
 

 
[Especially now that I know Zhao Zai isn’t really a little kid… this is even more fun.]
 

 
[To those of you who’ve been hooked by this, come join me in shipping the Dang-Zhao couple. Check out the Bilibili video “How to Conquer Me” for more.]
 

 
It was all in good fun and light teasing.
 

 
It's considered unethical to pair children together for shipping. That’s a sacred space that shouldn’t be tainted by profit. The production team of ‘Baby Chaos’ didn’t intentionally try to create a couple, but it can only be said that Zhao Zai is too lovable, a little sunbeam that cures arrogance. The simple, innocent feelings Noah expressed towards her, like wanting to be with her every day, hold her hand, and be her best friend, are pure and straightforward.
 

 
What kind of feeling is this? No one could categorize it.
 

 
It was more like the innocent fondness and admiration that one little cub might have for another.
 

 
Since Noah said it was love, then perhaps it was!
 

 
Time would tell, anyway.
 

 
The show ended with a group photo of all the participants before they left the park.
 

 
---
 

 
When Zhao Zai woke up, she immediately rolled down from her main personality's position.
 

 
And she really rolled.
 

 
She was still very young, and among the many personalities, she was one of the more incomplete and fragile ones. After finishing the entire variety show, she was so tired that she almost collapsed. She was swiftly scooped up by the sharp-eyed, quick-handed Consort Chen, who instructed Han Zhi to carry her back to the room to rest.
 

 
Han Zhi: "Zhao Zai hasn't woken up yet."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Let her rest for a while. I'll take over."
 

 
Consort Chen was the most glamorous and star-like personality among them.
 

 
She was used to being adored by the public. In the past, anyone who saw her had to kneel and call her "Consort." Even the most noble, like the emperor, would privately wash her feet for her. Sometimes, when attending large events, if Tong Zhao decided to be lazy and didn’t show up, she would send her substitute.
 

 
Master Lu didn’t think much of it: "Let her take the throne for an hour, and the matchmaker will have to work overtime for a month."
 

 
"Learn some new words and use them. I, your aunt, am very noble, and ordinary men aren't worthy."
 

 
Consort Chen was a little upset by her sarcastic remarks. After sitting in the main personality’s position, she wore a face of displeasure.
 

 
Tong Zhao had a separate filming room.
 

 
The room had a clean bathroom and a makeup table, so the celebrities could freshen up before meeting people.
 

 
Consort Chen sat in front of the makeup table, touching up her makeup.
 

 
At this time, a staff member came in with hot tea: "Because the modeling is special, Sister Xiao Zhao is the last to wake up. The other guests have already rested for a day. Would you like to watch the raw footage? I can play it now."
 

 
Some guests care a lot about their performance on the show, but since the memories from the holographic shoot hadn’t fully come back yet, they could only review the raw footage to reflect on it. For guests like Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang, there were staff members who would specially check on them after they woke up.
 

 
No need to send an assistant to ask—raw footage would be delivered directly to them.
 

 
"No need, thank you."
 

 
Consort Chen focused on retouching her makeup in the mirror.
 

 
For her, it seemed that making herself more beautiful was the most important thing in the world. She didn’t care about how her "self" had performed on the show. Of course, this didn’t mean she didn’t love her "self," it was just... which personality would mess things up? That was impossible, so she didn’t worry about it at all.
 

 
She’d rather think about what color eyeshadow to use.
 

 
Consort Chen liked vibrant, bright colors. After Master Lu criticized her, it made the Consort unhappy. Now, her makeup tone leaned towards a more aggressive style, and she picked the brightest lipstick from her makeup bag. The staff member beside her secretly admired her—if it weren’t for her stunning beauty, who could pull off such a bold color in everyday life?
 

 
True, a female star's "everyday" life couldn’t even really be called "everyday."
 

 
Because she had just woken up from the holographic shoot, her face was slightly pale. Her soft lips were painted with bright red lipstick, and her cool, fair skin made her look like a beautiful woman stepping out of a dark, mystical painting. Her long hair fell beside her face, embodying the classic beauty of black hair, white skin, and red lips.
 

 
The staff member had been watching the filming of the show the entire time.
 

 
She couldn’t help but reflect in her heart—who could have imagined that such an angelic little girl like Tong Zhao would grow up to become such a powerful, elegant beauty?
 

 
When Tong Zhao had just said "thank you" to her, she honestly couldn’t feel the gratitude in those words.
 

 
It was as if it was only natural for others to serve her, to be kind to her.
 

 
What was even more puzzling was that when the staff member realized she was being treated this way... she wasn’t even upset? She wasn’t arrogant, just... everything felt natural.
 

 
The staff member stopped thinking about it.
 

 
After all, delivering footage and water to the guests was part of her job.
 

 
Next to "Tong Zhao," the staff member instinctively held her breath.
 

 
The filming room was silent.
 

 
At that moment, the sound of running footsteps in the hallway broke the silence, followed by the staff member's helpless shout: “Noah, wait, don’t run around! Although Tong Zhao has woken up, she might not have rested well…”
 

 
"I’ll be good and quiet, and I’ll stay with her while she rests!"
 

 
Noah's childish voice could be heard from far away.
 

 
You couldn’t hide a child's voice. The tone was full of eagerness, and also a bit of panic.
 

 
When Noah thought of the three friends he had made on the show, Xiao Quan and Jia Jia had already met up, but Tong Zhao had been nowhere to be found. The staff member said she had woken up the latest and they would have to wait for her. If she woke up, they would let him know…
 

 
No one knew how to explain this to the child.
 

 
Since Noah was mixed-race, apart from filming this show, he had been flying around the world with his parents, rarely engaging with Chinese films, and couldn’t even read all the Chinese characters. Tong Zhao may have been popular, but she hadn’t reached the level of fame in Hollywood.
 

 
So, Noah, who was in the dark, couldn’t wait any longer.
 

 
He believed that Tong Zhao would definitely understand him. He would stay quietly by her side and not cause any trouble. Once he saw her, he would apologize properly and tell her he couldn’t wait to see her.
 

 
The common trait between children and adults is that, when they like someone, they rush toward them.
 

 
No need to hide it, no need to learn it.
 

 
The filming room door was half-open, and Noah knew that the little princess was sleeping behind it. He barged in—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, I’m here!”
 

 
……
 

 
……
 

 
“Huh?”
 

 
A long time later, Noah still couldn’t forget that lazy, melodious voice.
 

 
It was different from the little princess he remembered.
 

 
But he could vaguely see the same person in her features.
 

 
The woman in front of him clearly looked like someone who had fully matured, her tone lazy, her eyes glancing at him with a detached, indifferent look.
 

 
"Did you call me?"
 

 
"I... I’m looking for Tong Zhao."
 

 
He said it softly, his tone weakening.
 

 
Noah was usually quite bold with adults.
 

 
But in front of this woman, he couldn’t muster his usual bravado.
 

 
The Consort was an exceptional beauty among women, but Noah hadn’t yet matured enough to understand her allure or be tempted by her. He simply felt that she exuded a terrifying, unapproachable aura, almost like the snake spirit in ‘Calabash Brothers’ or the evil queen in ‘Snow White’...
 

 
"I am Tong Zhao."
 

 
Noah was afraid of her, and the Consort didn’t particularly like children either.
 

 
Moreover, just before, Master Lu had teased her, saying she always attracted troublesome admirers. She was in a bad mood, and this time, she just wanted to dress up nicely, with no interest in anyone. She had even less patience for coaxing a little brat like Noah. "Is there something you need?"
 

 
"I... I... you... you..."
 

 
Noah lost his words.
 

 
At that moment, a staff member who had caught up squatted down to explain to little Noah about Tong Zhao's situation.
 

 
Noah wasn’t dumb. When he finally understood that his innocent first love, his little bride, was actually a big sister...
 

 
He stood frozen in place.
 

 
His mindset crumbled like the Niagara Falls—completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Who am I? Where am I?
 

 
Who is she?
 

 
The little princess in his memory had a soft, fair face and cute lips. She would gently call him Noah, care for him, be especially kind to him, and tolerate his stubborn, bad temper. After recovering his memories, Noah had resolved to change his attitude. In the past, he didn’t care if others disliked him, but now, he didn’t want to be disliked by Zhao Zai.
 

 
"Is this the kid from the show? I haven’t recovered my memory, so I don’t remember who you are,"
 

 
The big sister’s bright red lips curved into a distant, polite smile. Her face was still incredibly beautiful, but it was nothing like Noah’s familiar image of her.
 

 
"If there’s nothing special, then forget about me."
 

 
This conversation felt like a kingfisher releasing a fish back into the water.
 

 
Having experienced the cruelty and unfairness of love at an early age, Noah didn’t cry out loud. He was just very confused:
 

 
"Will Zhao Zai become like you when she grows up?"
 

 
Noticing the disdain and disappointment in the little boy's words, the Consort raised an eyebrow and scoffed, "Probably. If there’s something you want to say to her, it’s the same if you say it to me. I can simulate her answer for you."
 

 
After all, the personalities knew each other very well.
 

 
Noah stood there in a daze, continuing to doubt his life:
 

 
"I originally wanted to ask if you could be my bride when you grow up..."
 

 
Oh, so it turns out you’re a subject under my skirt.
 

 
Although he had no memory of the person in front of him, Noah was still a very handsome boy. His appearance revealed many admirable qualities, making him a potential suitor—someone who could be considered a decent prospect, which made the Empress Dowager take a second glance at Zhao Zai. In her memory, she had never been involved in "puppy love," but she had always had male classmates who liked her.
 

 
Attracting men’s affection—just as expected of her.
 

 
Consort Chen mentally gave herself a thumbs-up.
 

 
Her lips finally curled into a more sincere smile as she repeated her earlier words:
 

 
"Forget about me."
 

 
After speaking, Consort Chen gently cupped the boy’s stunned face with her delicate hands and kissed his forehead. She then turned away, casually checking her WeChat messages on her phone, her body language making it clear that she would not give this little boy any more hope.
 

 
Noah lifted his hand to cover his forehead.
 

 
There was a faint trace of a lingering red mark.
 

 
He stared at the Consort Chen in disbelief—
 

 
Bad! Woman!
 

 
Noah arrived full of excitement, only to leave with doubts about life.
 

 
Meanwhile, Consort Chen casually flipped through her WeChat messages.
 

 
As she saw it, there were only three men who might have a chance with "herself." Shi Qianqiu had some sparks with her, but it seemed he wasn’t interested in taking it further and preferred to keep the relationship as a good director-actor bond... Consort Chen could understand him—after all, for him, a girlfriend was easy to find, but a beloved lead actress was rare.
 

 
What if the relationship soured after getting involved?
 

 
Plus, it wasn’t like she couldn’t live without him.
 

 
This mature and effortless way of handling things greatly impressed Shi Qianqiu in Consort Chen's mind. The more difficult a man was to handle, the more interesting he seemed. However, Zhao Zhao might not agree with that.
 

 
As for Wei Zekai...
 

 
When she opened his chat, the corners of Consort Chen's lips twitched in a rather ungraceful manner.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You were so cute when you were little.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [That little brat is kind of annoying.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Damn, I can tell he's not sincere! Don’t get involved in early love!]
 

 
...
 

 
The kids knew more about fighting for what they wanted than he did.
 

 
After reading Wei Zekai’s usual ramblings, Consort Chen had an urge to call Noah back. If he was willing to start striving from now on, aiming to become a world leader or the President of the United States, she might be willing to consider it.
 

 
After a brief pause, Consort Chen typed: [What about you? Are you sincere with me?]
 

 
Not long after the message was sent, Zhao Zhao woke up.
 

 
Seeing her having fun, Zhao Zhao didn’t rush to reclaim her seat. She was still a little groggy from sleep, and since the memories of the other personalities hadn’t flooded back yet, she didn’t know what Consort Chen had been up to behind her back. So, she suspiciously asked: [What happened while I was gone…]
 

 
Consort Chen: [How could I tarnish someone's reputation without reason? Not only did I avoid causing any trouble, but I also helped you fend off the bad suitors!]
 

 
【Bad suitors?】
 

 
[Hmm…] Consort Chen thought for a moment. [Maybe I should say, the bad seeds.]
 

 
Zhao Zhao still believed her.
 

 
After all, while Consort Chen was popular with men, she was also very good at rejecting them.
 

 
After saying that, Consort Chen returned the main personality's position to her.
 

 
Before Zhao Zhao could recall her manipulative actions, Consort Chen swiftly ran off and closed the door.
 

 
Once the door was closed, Consort Chen no longer cared for anyone.
 

 
Zhao Zhao blinked, and in the mirror, she saw her makeup looking even more cold and glamorous than usual.
 

 
If not for the team’s request, she would have preferred a gentler, more elegant style.
 

 
Then, her phone vibrated.
 

 
Zhao Zhao looked down—
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I... don’t know.]
 

 
What does he not know?
 

 
Zhao Zhao scrolled up and found the question Consort Chen had sent, and everything became clear.
 

 
As she was thinking about how to reply, Wei Zekai sent another message: [Can you give me some time to think?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [You still need to think?]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [I was going to say something simple, like 'brotherhood is stronger than gold, with unbreakable loyalty,' but before I sent it, I suddenly didn’t feel like saying that anymore. I don’t know why, let me think it over.]
 

 
He sent a meme of a little cat in a toilet, with the caption: [I can’t figure it out.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: [You’re awake? Once you’re rested, let’s have a team-building day. We miss you!]
 

 
"Okay."
 

 
Zhao Zhao's lips curved slightly.
 

 
Xiao Kai had always been slow in matters of love, and Zhao Zhao felt she was also a person full of uncertainty. She had gone through so much, and it seemed like she was a bundle of contradictions... She simply didn’t have the time to figure others out, only wanting to understand herself first.
 

 
To her surprise, part of her memory from the variety show had already been restored.
 

 
Zhao Zhao felt that her mental strength had grown again, which is why she recovered faster than others.
 

 
In the variety show, Zhao Zhao remembered someone had praised her for having a strong sense of purpose, never giving others the chance to pity her. But she couldn’t remember who that person was.
 

 
Now, she remembered.
 

 
It was after she completed a quick-transmigration task, when the system gave her the task evaluation.
 

 
What was that task again?
 

 
As Zhao Zhao pondered deeper, a door deep within her memory palace slowly creaked open.
 

 
It was a door covered in yellow high-risk seals and iron chains.
# Chapter126
System: [Warning!] [Warning!]
 

 
[Host, please promptly unlock this personality in a space with high privacy and security!]
 

 
It had been years since Zhao Zhao last heard a system prompt, and she actually felt a bit nostalgic. Before, whenever her missions were almost completed, she would often receive warnings from the system. Zhao Zhao had a high level of trust in the system, so without questioning it, she politely declined the program's invitation to stay for a celebratory meal, using the excuse of not feeling well. She took the nanny van and quickly returned.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao locked herself in her room, the lock on the deepest door had already been knocked off.
 

 
The consciousness palace was eerily quiet.
 

 
In the grand hall, Lu Xianchang stayed with her, while everyone else returned to their rooms.
 

 
In Zhao Zhao's quick-transmigration journey, only Lu Xianchang was from a fantasy world, one with high magic and martial arts. Even though they had arrived in an era with thin spiritual energy, Lu Xianchang still managed to use effective methods to cultivate. It was unlikely that she could embark on the immortal path again, as the conditions of spiritual energy weren’t there, but she was definitely superior to ordinary people in many ways.
 

 
So, had she been to other high-magic worlds in her numerous instances?
 

 
Zhao Zhao couldn’t remember.
 

 
Perhaps within those various doors, there were also personalities with special abilities.
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [Do you not remember who is behind this door?]
 

 
Zhao Zhao: [I don't remember.] She gave a bitter smile. [Zhao Zai, because she is a part of my childhood self, I clearly remember her, which is why I was able to think of her before I opened the door. I can only feel that this personality is a bit dangerous.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang: [More dangerous than Duan Ge?]
 

 
Duan Ge, having lived through a blood-soaked apocalyptic world, often harbored a desire for violence and a tendency for bloodshed, even when she returned to a peaceful era. This could hardly be blamed on her; in those times, even a moment of mercy could mean death for herself and the young companions she led. For instance, when she participated in ‘One Life Survivor’, Duan Ge killed twenty people in a holographic world, which allowed her to release her violent and brutal rage. In the real world, those twenty people were unharmed, and the entire program, including her, gained both fame and fortune.
 

 
This was why Zhao Zhao felt she needed to keep performing, to help the various personalities find a balance between the illusory and the real.
 

 
Zhao Zhao considered for a moment: [...Probably.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang reassured her: [It’s fine. No matter how dangerous a person is, there's no reason to harm oneself.]
 

 
All the personalities loved Zhao Zhao.
 

 
Asking the other personalities to return to their rooms wasn’t out of fear of death. After all, they were all in the same boat, so why fear anything? It was just that they didn’t want to trigger the new friend. Zhao Zhao was very protective of them.
 

 
Zhao Zhao cupped her face: [So, I just found a quiet place to wait for her to come out.]
 

 
This feeling was a bit strange, like waiting for a monster egg to hatch.
 

 
Before the eggshell cracked, no one knew what kind of monster would emerge.
 

 
While the two were chatting in a casual manner, the door lock fell, and a pale white hand appeared.
 

 
It was as if this white hand had been nurtured in countless, lightless deep chambers.
 

 
The young girl was dressed in a pure white silk saree, adorned with intricate gold and silver threads, both bright and dark, shimmering as she moved. However, her saree was more revealing than the traditional version, exposing her slender waist and thighs, barely covered.
 

 
She wore a lot of accessories: large, vivid red rubies, gold ornaments, and water diamonds. Her platinum blonde hair was styled into a Greek goddess braid at the back of her head, with perfectly round, lustrous pearls strung together in a chain and woven into the braid.
 

 
With so many accessories, none of them could outshine the girl's natural beauty.
 

 
The pearls paled in comparison to her milk-like skin.
 

 
The rubies dimmed before her lips.
 

 
Even supreme authority was nothing more than a long stick she kicked around, slightly uncomfortable to the touch.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao saw that face she had seen countless times in the mirror, yet slightly different now, she remembered her name.
 

 
"Iya, you're awake."
 

 
She blurted it out.
 

 
"I'm awake..."
 

 
The girl, called Iya, gave her a sweet smile, and her voice was filled with a complex, crazy joy:
 

 
"Will there be my followers here?"
 

 
＊
 

 
Along with the name came the vast memories from that world.
 

 
Even the reason why she had forgotten this personality entirely was remembered at the same time...
 

 
System: "Because you stayed in that world for too long, your previous mental capacity wasn't enough to hold the full version of 'Iya,' so it was temporarily sealed."
 

 
To put it bluntly, the previous configuration wasn't sufficient.
 

 
Forcing the application to run would have burned out the graphics card or overloaded the memory.
 

 
That was the first time Zhao Zhao traveled to a Western fantasy world.
 

 
In that world, it was common to have both gods of light and demon gods.
 

 
The God of Light represents the order of the entire continent. Believing in it grants the power of faith, and with this power, warriors and mages can combat the dark creatures. What kind of order is this? It's like no matter what job you have, if you want to protect the value of your money, you ultimately have to get involved with the investment industry.
 

 
The power of faith is like that.
 

 
You can have any elemental attribute—metal, wood, water, fire, or earth—but if you want to use it in actual combat against enemies from the abyss, you must believe in the God of Light. At the time, Zhao Zhao thought, if Sasuke from ‘Naruto’ came and wanted to perform a Fire Style jutsu, he would first have to pray to the God of Light, to infuse his chakra with the power of light... Ah, no, the power of light.
 

 
The identity that the system assigned to Zhao Zhao in this world was that of a saintess from a rural temple.
 

 
Strictly speaking, she was a saintess in reserve.
 

 
In the rural temple, there were dozens of other saintesses in reserve, and across the entire continent, there were over a hundred temples. Ultimately, only one person could truly become the saintess after passing numerous trials.
 

 
The saintess trial was like the imperial exams of the Western fantasy world.
 

 
But it wasn’t so public, more like an unspoken secret.
 

 
Zhao Zhao had long been accustomed to starting in difficult situations, where one wrong move could cost her life. So, she accepted this setting without resistance, hiding her sharp edges, and decided to follow the rules of this world.
 

 
At that time, the system only issued one task: to complete the current trial.
 

 
Zhao Zhao completed task after task, gradually learning how sinful this land, blessed by the God of Light, truly was. The saintess trial in the rural temple was simple: it required beauty, a good figure, and virginity, along with a written exam. Cultural knowledge couldn’t be too low, and the affinity with the God of Light had to be high.
 

 
Affinity with the God of Light referred to how firm one’s belief was.
 

 
Because the difficulty of this world was unusually high, the system granted Zhao Zhao administrator-level permissions—just as the system could consider the host’s endurance limits and seal parts of her memories, she, upon gaining this permission, could rewrite her own beliefs, deeply hypnotizing herself until she even began to believe her own lies.
 

 
The first line of code Zhao Zhao rewrote was her deep, unwavering belief in the God of Light.
 

 
Even if she performed actions that violated the teachings, she could genuinely justify them as acts of piety, and this would not affect her ability to gain the power of faith.
 

 
At the time, she simply wanted to make the task more convenient.
 

 
Otherwise, as a young person raised in a family with strong political ideals, she would never have been able to obtain the power of faith.
 

 
The trials at the town-level temple required learning magic, something Zhao Zhao had no problem with—she learned it very quickly.
 

 
After learning magic, the next step was to assist the instructor in killing dark creatures, which wasn’t difficult either.
 

 
Her repeated excellent performances made Zhao Zhao a key candidate for further development, and her efficiency in completing tasks was top-notch.
 

 
After passing the basic tests, the saintess would be presented with a snow-white magical blindfold by the local temple’s priest, which had delicate lace edges. From then on, she could only perceive the outside world through the lens of her faith in the God of Light.
 

 
That was a very special experience.
 

 
Many young saintesses fell and got injured while walking, but Zhao Zhao adapted well. After all, one reason was that she "deeply trusted" the guidance of the God of Light, and the other reason was, wasn’t this basically an infrared thermal scanner?
 

 
The saintess tasks assigned to her were unexpectedly simple, resembling beginner quests in an online game. Accompanying the instructor to hunt dark creatures was thrilling, but most of the time, she just accompanied vehicles transporting goods. The containers were covered with cloth, and occasionally, eerie, rasping sounds could be heard from inside.
 

 
The instructor said they were dark creatures.
 

 
The appearance of dark creatures would be distorted when sensed, and the saintess would only feel how hideous they were.
 

 
When Zhao Zhao rode in a carriage to a larger temple, the trials she faced became even stranger.
 

 
Main Quest 3: Temple Trial – Cleanse the Bodies of Dark Creatures
 

 
Dark creatures also had magic cores, which, when refined, could be turned into magical potions, useful in many ways. However, before refinement, they needed to be purified, and having the saintess cleanse their corrupt bodies was one of the essential processes.
 

 
Main Quest 4: Temple Trial – Teach the New Saintesses
 

 
The saintess candidates all came from orphaned girls across the continent.
 

 
At the time, the identity Zhao Zhao took on, aside from her beauty and relatively high magical talent, was that of someone who could barely afford a meal. If not for the temple taking her in, the legal protections for orphans and widows were very limited, and surviving outside was a major issue.
 

 
Those young saintesses were in the same situation Zhao Zhao had been in before.
 

 
To eat well, sleep well, and be protected, they could only do their best to complete the trials.
 

 
With the blindfold on, Zhao Zhao only knew their height and weight, unable to see the contours of their faces. Among the first group of girls she was in charge of, there was a younger sister who loved to sing, and she liked to touch Zhao Zhao's blindfold, which made her eyelids itch. Guna enjoyed humming her own tunes, and perhaps because of her creativity and imagination, she was a bit difficult to manage.
 

 
Everyone firmly believed in the God of Light and the temple. To carry out her tasks, Zhao Zhao also followed suit and brainwashed herself, but part of her still thought like a modern person. She felt something was wrong, though her “doubt” was modified through code and beautified into—
 

 
She suspected that the temple was not truly faithful to the God of Light, nor was it fully practicing the teachings of the God of Light.
 

 
Zhao Zhao began to collect evidence.
 

 
One of the pieces of evidence that confirmed her suspicion was when the system issued a side mission the moment she began to have doubts.
 

 
Side Quest 1: Strange Sounds in the Priest's Room
 

 
Quest Description: The priest of the Jiadoluo Temple trusts you greatly and often assigns you trivial paperwork. You have the privilege and honor of moving freely around the temple. Today, due to your curiosity, you secretly pocketed some documents to carry with you so that, even if you were discovered while searching the temple at midnight, you would have a good excuse to explain—simply that you were trying to return the documents to the priest! With this in mind, you overheard strange sounds outside the priest's room, similar to the eerie noises heard from the cargo containers carrying dark creatures.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Quest Description: In the class you teach, there are five little girls. Four of them passed the trial, while one was eliminated for misbehaving. No one cares about what happened to the failed girl. You try asking Sister Cheng in the temple, and she tells you that the unqualified girls will return to their original places and will no longer be under the guidance of the God of Light. The other successful saintesses are afraid of returning to a life of hunger and cold, so they have become more eager to study.
 

 
Because of your favored status, your room is stocked with plenty of dry food and snacks. Even though the temple can't keep the singing girl, you want to give her some supplies before she is kicked out, to help her survive until she can find a job in the town.
 

 
You couldn’t find her.
 

 
No one talks about the eliminated saintess Guna anymore, and the system didn’t punish you for failing to complete the side quest. The quest is still marked as "In Progress." You guess that this means she’s still alive after being kicked out of the temple; otherwise, the quest would have been marked as "Failed" due to the girl’s death.
 

 
Perhaps this is the best news, you think optimistically.
 

 
---
 

 
The annual Festival of Light is approaching.
 

 
This year is especially different.
 

 
The previous saintess died as a martyr in battle against the dark creatures, so this year, during the Festival of Light, the Pope will select a true saintess, who will be worshipped by all the people. The chosen saintess will reside in the Holy Temple of Light in the imperial capital and will have the privilege of meeting the emperor without kneeling.
 

 
Since only the followers of the God of Light can fight the dark creatures, the empire's royal power is completely subordinated to the church’s authority.
 

 
If the king is not devout enough, or if something displeases the Pope, the defense of the empire will be in jeopardy.
 

 
During the Festival of Light, the Pope will symbolically kill a dark creature.
 

 
This dark creature, used for show, will have already been "prepared" before the event, weakened to the point of near death to ensure there are no casualties.
 

 
Zhao Zhao is the highly anticipated seed candidate.
 

 
And she also felt that once she took the saintess throne and got close to the core of the church’s power, all her doubts would be resolved.
 

 
Main Quest 5: The Eve of the Festival of Light
 

 
You are assigned to cleanse the sacrificial offering.
 

 
The dark creatures have their own unique language, which sounds like meaningless raspy growls to humans. Their physical composition is also very strange. By touch, you sense a body similar to that of a medium-sized dog, bird-like wings, and four legs covered in cold, wet scales.
 

 
There is also a flat face, with pits and depressions.
 

 
When cleaning the captured dark creatures in the past, they were always very noisy, but this one is unusually quiet. It had been roaring angrily, but when you entered the prison cell, it fell silent. You are somewhat surprised, but also relieved that today’s task will be simpler.
 

 
Until, while you are cleaning its body, you hear its hoarse, subdued cries form a familiar melody.
 

 
Its voice is broken, like a shattered wind instrument, and at first, it sounds like the desperate crying of a child.
 

 
Can dark creatures sing?
 

 
You are astonished.
 

 
Then, you stop scrubbing the dark creature’s body.
 

 
Because you suddenly remember something.
 

 
Side Quest 2: The Saintess Who Failed the Trial
 

 
Completed
 

 
"You found Guna."
 

 
*
 

 
[Hiss...]
 

 
[The moment I see you, my head hurts.]
 

 
Tong Zhao pressed her head, as a flood of memories poured into her brain, causing a splitting headache.
 

 
When Iya sat down, a human-shaped chair suddenly appeared in the consciousness palace. It was made by four heretics who had harmed innocent girls for their own selfish desires. Even as she sat, she could still see faces filled with pain and regret beneath her: "Take your time to recall, I'm not in a hurry."
 

 
The Dark God, the dark creatures, and the Saintess trials were all a scam created by the church to consolidate its divine power.
 

 
The Dark God had long since left this continent, having been defeated by the Light God.
 

 
However, the reason the church could stand on equal footing with the king and even hold the upper hand was because they fought the Dark God every year... Without the Dark God, the temple would just be a place where people went to pray on Sundays. At that time, the Pope was unwilling to accept this outcome, so he used powerful magic to create the illusion that the Dark God had not left.
 

 
The temple did not need so many Saintesses.
 

 
But the temple needed many, many dark creatures.
 

 
The dark creatures were created using girls with magical talent through the church’s unique synthesis array, no different from when the Dark God was still around, except that they were now artificially made.
 

 
A carefully selected Saintess stands above countless bones. Even though some of the previous Saintesses, who enjoyed the benefits of power, learned the truth, they either collapsed because they had unknowingly aided the evil during their trials or rationalized their actions.
 

 
More than that, they believed in the church wholeheartedly.
 

 
There have been many generations of Saintess trials.
 

 
When Tong Zhao crossed over, it had clearly become something like ‘The Hunger Games’. Not only did it serve as a provider of raw materials for dark creatures, but it also became a grand gamble for some nobles and high-ranking clergy. They would place their bets on a particular Saintess, and if she passed all the trials and ultimately became the true Saintess, the person who placed the bet would gain her virginity.
 

 
Was all of this just for the virginity?
 

 
It was all about the pleasure of desecrating the Saintess.
 

 
The identity of Iya that Tong Zhao crossed into was one of those bets placed by powerful figures.
 

 
Because of Tong Zhao’s extraordinary faith, the church always considered her a deeply brainwashed fool. They trusted her completely and even gave her many opportunities to investigate the truth. As she unraveled the layers of deceit, she witnessed even darker, more brutal and inhumane truths…
 

 
As a female reporter, it takes a great deal of courage to face the darkness of human nature.
 

 
In her previous world, the reporter Shuyi had fallen into depression.
 

 
But in this Western fantasy world, Iya not only observed all of this, but she also discovered that those seemingly simple and ordinary tasks were actually unintentionally helping to perpetuate such atrocities. She was a cog in the entire system of sin. Every Saintess who passed the trials was a sinner.
 

 
The peace and warmth after crossing over were all an illusion.
 

 
The kinder the person, the less they could bear the darkness.
 

 
Iya was so angry that she almost lost control. Her nails dug deeply into her palm. When Guna, who noticed something was wrong, affectionately rubbed her eye mask against her as she usually did in class, the berserk magic shattered part of Iya’s eye structure. Blood poured from her eye sockets, like tears of blood.
 

 
It was her fault.
 

 
She was guilty.
 

 
Iya felt it was her responsibility to eradicate all this evil, even if this idea seemed as insignificant to the authorities as a mayfly shaking a great tree.
 

 
At the same time, the system unlocked the final mission for her in this world.
 

 
"Become the Last Saintess"
 

 
The system’s original intention was for Iya to gather evidence, expose the truth, and overthrow the church.
 

 
Iya felt that wasn’t enough.
 

 
Wasn’t the church in desperate need of dark creatures?
 

 
A fake wouldn’t do. It had to be real.
 

 
Inside her consciousness palace, Tong Zhao reminded her:
 
"We have children here, so let’s not bring out such a restricted chair."
 

 
"So troublesome."
 

 
Iya sighed softly.
 

 
The next moment, the human-shaped chair was covered in a layer of black leather, but the outlines of limbs occasionally pushing out from beneath the leather still caused one's sanity to drop.
 

 
"Not only has the Dark God left, but the Light God also gave up on its followers long ago."
 

 
"It’s all a deception the church wove together to maintain its power."
 

 
"Later, I found the legacy of the Dark God before it left."
 

 
Iya spoke as though it were a mere detail.
 

 
In reality, she had to race against time before the coming Light Festival, finding a way to break the deadlock. Half of her belief came from the fact that the system never provided a dead end, and the other half came from overwhelming anger and malice. She didn’t even consider herself to be delivering justice; she just wanted to kill all these sinful heretics, to return the atrocities they committed against the little Saintesses back to them tenfold.
 

 
"I really didn’t do much."
 

 
I just stirred up internal strife within the church, triggered two purges of the old church with the Truth Wars, and ultimately, by gathering the faith power from across the continent, became a new deity.
 

 
During the most crucial period, Iya used her delicate demeanor to deceive the church, and this habit became ingrained in her bones. After becoming the only and last Saintess, the continent was unified and brought peace.
 

 
To punish herself, Saintess Iya’s temple was not luxurious. It was said that there were no holy servants attending her; apart from the Saintess living there, the temple was just a dilapidated and crumbling building. Travelers who accidentally entered the temple said that the absence of holy servants was a lie. They met a weak and timid blind girl, who, despite her fragility, provided them with food to stave off hunger and a place to rest.
 

 
He wanted to meet the Saintess.
 

 
But just mentioning her name made the servant girl tremble with fear.
 

 
It seems the Saintess was indeed as brutal and powerful as the rumors suggested!
 

 
Iya had stayed in the western fantasy world for so long that she almost forgot she was only there for a mission. She didn’t like the system, and she didn’t really like herself either. To this day, she couldn’t forgive herself for noticing so late...
 

 
She knew that even if she had realized earlier, she might not have been able to make a change quickly.
 

 
With the legacy of the Dark God, her divine power grew stronger, but so did the impulse to commit evil. After maintaining a century of peace on the continent, she chose to end her life and left that plane.
 

 
Iya also inherited Tong Zhao's memories from that time.
 

 
She furrowed her brows in distress: "I’m afraid I can’t be of any help."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "I suggest you be honest with yourself."
 

 
"Alright," she replied.
 

 
Iya propped up her long, slender, and beautiful legs, and with one foot, she stomped down on one of the restless chair components, silencing its movements. Her tone was lazy:
 

 
"Why should I help you? The world is better off destroyed. Just lock me up again."
 

 
"Once you're released, there's no locking you back in. Your destructive desires will affect me, including the mental imprint left on my soul from the Dark God's legacy. You must commit evil at certain times each year; you must harm living beings."
 

 
Iya said nothing.
 

 
At that time, her solution was to harm the worst of the evil-doers. When the old heretics had been mostly purged, there was no one left to kill in order to complete her mission.
 

 
So, what was she supposed to do?
 

 
Where should all that overwhelming malice go?
 

 
The powerful and violent Saintess chose to point the sword at herself, to torture herself in order to atone.
 

 
This was the only self-destructive aspect of Tong Zhao’s personality.
 

 
"I can take on some villain roles for you, so you don't have to hurt yourself anymore," Tong Zhao said. "It's not the same world anymore."
 

 
"I know."
 

 
The lace blindfold covered Iya’s eyes, so Tong Zhao couldn’t see her expression.
 

 
But their feelings were impossible to hide from each other.
 

 
They were silent for a long time.
 

 
Iya slightly curled her pale lips, bringing up everything that both personalities knew, but had never spoken aloud:
 

 
"Are you trying to convince me to forgive myself? Haven’t you always blamed yourself for not realizing that Xu Zhu and her mother were a pair of scum, always thinking it was your fault your mother died? That’s why, in every world you’ve traveled through, you’ve tried so hard not to make mistakes. The person who’s most cruel to you is yourself, the one who draws the line with others is you."
 

 
For those without boundaries, forgiving oneself is a simple matter.
 

 
Even if they commit murder, arson, or force others into prostitution, they have their own logic to absolve themselves.
 

 
But for pure, gentle people…
 

 
Overcoming oneself is, in fact, the hardest challenge.
 

 
The moment for self-reflection always comes without warning, and suddenly "yourself" exposes all your secrets. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.
 

 
Despite the embarrassment, there was also a sense of relief.
 

 
"You're right,"
 

 
Tong Zhao looked directly at her, recalling every version of herself in each world, the faces that were similar yet slightly different, the varying thoughts and personalities: "So, I'm slowly remembering every version of myself from each world, trying to forgive myself."
 

 
Iya turned her face away.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked over and wrapped her arms around her, and Iya didn’t push her away.
 

 
"I have to admit, one of the reasons I’m letting you out now is because I was previously afraid to face the mistakes I’ve made."
 

 
The Saintess didn’t hold back: "Little useless thing."
 

 
"Saintess, hug the little useless thing."
 

 
Iya snorted coldly and pressed her into her embrace:
 

 
"I need to occasionally commit evil in the holographic footage. Don’t try to cling to me for no reason."
# Chapter127
After the edited version of "Baby Chaos" aired, it sparked a wave on Weibo.
 

 
What kind of wave?
 

 
Fans imagined what their favorite idols would be like as a child on a variety show, and celebrities flooded the platform posting their childhood photos, blatantly riding on the coattails of the hype. However, the attention they brought ended up reflecting back on the "Baby Chaos" show itself, expanding the reach of the show. In the end, more people ended up benefiting from the increased attention.
 

 
Among those benefiting the most were Tong Zhao and Jiang Dang.
 

 
Although Jiang Dang telling ghost stories to kids sparked some controversy, many people were surprised by his attention to detail in caring for the tired little Zhao Zai. It turned out that he had some surprisingly humanistic qualities—there were even some netizens who took the opposite view, saying, "You guys are exaggerating and demonizing this male singer! He’s just a bit quirky, how is he a psychopath?"
 

 
Whether Jiang Dang was a normal person or mentally unstable was the subject of much debate.
 

 
The entertainment industry is a dream-making business, and questioning the authenticity of dreams is as futile as boiling a crane or burning a zither.
 

 
After the variety show filming ended, Jiang Dang threw himself into preparations for his national tour concert.
 

 
The first stop of the presale sold out in an unprecedented frenzy.
 

 
Tong Zhao wished him well through WeChat, but due to her work commitments, it was unlikely that she would attend his concert.
 

 
Jiang Dang: "You’re rejecting me, I know."
 

 
Jiang Dang: "Can I sing one more song for you?"
 

 
Many people, including Jiang Dang’s assistants, thought he was acting a bit abnormal.
 

 
But in Tong Zhao’s eyes, Jiang Dang just retained the sharpness of a child towards the world—impulsive, spontaneous, with an artistic and epic kind of carefree attitude. Even his sadness was poetic. After a brief pause, he added: "Actually, I meant to ask: Can I sing one more song for you? I might sing for quite a while, so you can do other things while keeping the speaker on."
 

 
Jiang Dang's concert sold out like crazy, and tickets became hard to get.
 

 
It wasn't just his female fans; many people were drawn in because some of his songs were incredibly popular, so much so that no one could resist humming along to them. Many people who went to the concert filmed it and posted it on Douyin, and inviting someone along to watch was also a good choice.
 

 
A lot of people wanted to hear him sing, and often on his Weibo posts, there would be requests for him to cover certain songs.
 

 
Jiang Dang, depending on his mood, would sometimes fulfill his fans' wishes.
 

 
And at this moment, he hoped that someone would be willing to listen to him sing.
 

 
Tong Zhao directly called him.
 

 
As expected, Jiang Dang sang for a long time. She sat on the newly installed swing chair at home, gently rocking as she listened to him play and sing love songs, as if it were a private concert just for her. By the time she began to feel a little drowsy, he stopped: "It's getting late, you should go to bed."
 

 
"Mm."
 

 
"Goodnight."
 

 
Tong Zhao, a bit sleepy, took off her over-ear headphones and shifted from the swing chair to lie on the bed, her mind wandering off with all sorts of disconnected thoughts. She was wondering: What exactly is Jiang Dang's emotional intelligence like? At certain moments, he always seemed to intuitively understand what the other person truly needed, knowing which things didn't need to be asked or said, and when it was time to end things.
 

 
Jiang Dang never asked why she rejected him.
 

 
He didn’t even want to improve himself after knowing the reason, just like falling in love with a drifting cloud—trying to touch it was one thing, but missing it was regrettable, yet not something worth obsessing over.
 

 
Even if she said nothing, he knew exactly when she started to feel sleepy.
 

 
After getting under the covers, Tong Zhao reached up and touched her ear.
 

 
Every time Tong Zhao listened to Jiang Dang sing or speak, her ears always felt like they had just had a massage, becoming unusually sensitive.
 

 
Consort Chen: "You must have some feelings for him, right?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "To be honest, it's hard not to feel something."
 

 
There's a reason why he became a big star. Jiang Dang has a particularly strong personal charm, like a whirlpool. Being around him makes her forget all the worldly troubles, and he always manages to surprise her in strange ways.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "If I weren't a celebrity, or if I were a bit more carefree, having a relationship with him might have been an unforgettable, beautiful experience."
 

 
After all, they’re both in the same industry. Their schedules are packed, and neither of them can make time for the other. Falling into a sticky romance would only be a mutual torment.
 

 
Of course, the fact that she could come up with so many reasons to reject him simply meant she didn't like him enough.
 

 
All the personalities respect Tong Zhao's choices; what she likes is what they all love.
 

 
Iya: "This has nothing to do with me."
 

 
Senior Lu: "Hmm."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Then add one more upstairs."
 

 
Tong Zhao wiped her face and quickly pushed this little life incident out of her mind.
 

 
For many people, love is a very important matter. Tong Zhao had no intention of criticizing "love-brains" because, after all, everyone has something they love. As long as it's not evil or harmful, how could there be any distinction in the value of what people love?
 

 
Jiang Dang was like a brilliant, enchanting aurora that passed through her life.
 

 
And she had no intention of holding on to that light.
 

 
In Jiang Dang's heart, she was the same kind of existence.
 

 
---
 

 
(Note: The term "love-brain" refers to someone whose thoughts and actions are overly focused on love, often to the detriment of other aspects of life.)
 

 
After all, she herself had many things she couldn't figure out, and she had to take it slow.
 

 
Aside from her entanglement with love, Zeshan's team, led by Tong Zhao over the past six months, had already developed into a mature company. While its size still couldn't compare to the family businesses of their parents' generation, it had become a force not to be underestimated. The legend of the "golden touch" continued to grow.
 

 
Even with a venture capital company, making money isn’t just about picking the right projects and waiting for the returns.
 

 
Choosing projects, negotiating details, periodically overseeing them, reviewing reports, adjusting strategies...
 

 
These details were all things Tong Zhao couldn’t control individually, nor did she have the time to.
 

 
She could only teach her team, and then let them lead the company. Zeshan’s path to success, and its growing success, was closely tied to Wei Zekai’s involvement. His investment sense might still need work, but he had a talent for managing and handling details. As long as Tong Zhao gave him some direction, he could make several times the return.
 

 
Isn’t this life fulfilling?
 

 
Tong Zhao was very satisfied.
 

 
After resting for more than half a month, she finally announced her collaboration with Shi Qianqiu, to the eager anticipation of many directors and producers.
 

 
As for the industry's reaction, there were people who were annoyed by Shi Qianqiu and others who were annoyed by Tong Zhao. While cursing and grumbling, they also kept an ear out for their movements and updates, afraid of crossing paths. If the two were working on the same subject matter, forget it—either they’d have to release earlier or later.
 

 
Delaying was a good option.
 

 
While releasing a similar project at the same time wasn’t ideal, if there was a blockbuster of the same genre released earlier, the one that followed could still ride the wave of excitement when it ended.
 

 
The netizens’ opinions were more direct and simple—
 

 
[I'm crying. As a fan of the "Dang Zhao" CP, after the airing of ‘Baby Chaos’, there's no more sugar for me, but now Shi Zhao has an after-show??]
 

 
[They’re true love, I’m sold.]
 

 
[Wasn't Tong Zhao nearly invisible in the media recently? Did they secretly go on a date?]
 

 
The discussion became very heated.
 

 
During her break, the only people Tong Zhao hung out with were the second-generation heirs. Their outings were all private, membership-only, and paparazzi couldn’t catch her. Even if they managed to snap a picture of her chauffeur-driven car, that was as good as seeing her in person. However, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as a completely secret wall. Some netizens managed to release two photos of Tong Zhao shopping with another young woman. Someone commented, “What kind of family do you have to be from to be able to be a sister with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
It was later uncovered that the girl was the daughter of a coal magnate, and she was also a member of Zeshan.
 

 
These two photos proved that Tong Zhao was in China during her break.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu?
 

 
He was easy to find. He didn’t treat himself like a celebrity, and even if he didn’t post on Weibo, anyone who was interested could still dig up information about his whereabouts. He had just surfed in Hawaii, then went to see glaciers, skied in Hokkaido, tried bungee jumping, cave diving, and wingsuit flying—he was living dangerously and carefree.
 

 
The two had completely different vacation styles. Netizens who were fans of the "Shi Zhao" CP were told to wake up.
 

 
The CP fans weren’t listening to reason.
 

 
As long as they were both on break at the same time, don’t ask, just assume they’ve gotten their marriage certificate.
 

 
This was a tabloid snippet, but what netizens were mainly discussing was what kind of movie Tong Zhao’s next project would be, and whether she would be collaborating with Shi Qianqiu. If the budget wasn’t a problem, would there be a male lead? Or would it be Han Zhi again?
 

 
Regarding the new movie, Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from his vacation, quickly clarified some rumors.
 

 
@Shi Qianqiu v:
 

 
The male lead for the new movie is not Han Zhi. It will most likely be a new actor.
 

 
It will be a brand-new version of Tong Zhao that you haven’t seen before.
 

 
No romance, just because a man and a woman are together doesn’t mean it’s love, right? That’s too cliché. When we’re collaborating on investments worth billions, gender doesn’t matter anymore in my heart. I just hope our next film turns out well.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s Weibo post was impressive, each line packed with a new revelation.
 

 
A brand-new version of Tong Zhao—netizens were puzzled, what kind of new version could she possibly have? Is she just going to change her image for every film? The third line clarifying there’s no romance wasn’t the key point anymore. After all, if they really were in a relationship, there’d be no need to hide it. If they kept insisting there’s nothing going on, it’s probably true. But Shi Qianqiu explicitly stated that the new movie was a commercial collaboration between him and Tong Zhao, involving investments of billions.
 

 
[Oh wow, this is heading for a big production!]
 

 
[Spending billions on a big movie and casting a newcomer as the male lead—that’s some serious boldness.]
 

 
[You’re dumb, does the male lead really matter when the movie has Tong Zhao? He’s not important, just a decoration. Wait and see, my Zhao will crush everything.]
 

 
Even those who weren’t Tong Zhao’s fans mostly held the stereotype that "Tong Zhao should always be at the center." With her shining like the brightest moon, other stars just seem to fade into the background.
 

 
So...
 

 
What kind of movie are Shi Qianqiu and Tong Zhao, this box-office-winning pair, preparing to make?
 

 
The industry couldn’t sit still.
 

 
If they couldn’t get to Tong Zhao, they’d try her agent. If they couldn’t find her agent, they’d start asking people who knew her—until even Jiang Dang relayed to Tong Zhao: [A lot of people are asking me if I can recommend them to you.]
 

 
This time, Tong Zhao was truly shocked.
 

 
After all, asking Jiang Dang for help was always risky.
 

 
Sometimes, he doesn’t listen to anyone or do what he’s supposed to.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed and asked him how those people had phrased it.
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment.
 

 
They had said a lot to him, speaking very humbly, putting on a very low profile. It seemed they were willing to take even a small, inconsequential role, though of course, a role with some screen time would be preferable.
 

 
[They said they... ]
 

 
Jiang Dang thought for a moment again: [They want a small, supporting role.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [......]
 

 
So they put in a lot of effort just to ask for a small role?
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t believe it, but it didn’t matter to her anymore. [Did you take any benefits from them? If you did, I can arrange a screen test for them.]
 

 
Jiang Dang sent a little cat shaking its head emoji.
 

 
Jiang Dang: [I told them... If such an opportunity comes up, I’ll just take it myself.]
 

 
He wasn't stupid.
# Chapter128
At Zeshan, it was Tong Zhao who led her team in business.
 

 
But when it came to investing in films, it was Shi Qianqiu who guided Tong Zhao. He meticulously taught her every intricate detail of the process involved in producing holographic films. This investment was different from the low-cost, high-return "Neverland Girl." It had a higher standard, requiring more attention to detail.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu discovered that even though Tong Zhao had already established herself as a box-office queen in the film industry, she was still very humble and eager to learn in unfamiliar areas. Her learning ability was exceptionally strong, making her a very pleasant student to teach.
 

 
However, having a strong learning ability was one thing.
 

 
What truly surprised Shi Qianqiu, though, was something else.
 

 
...
 

 
"I didn’t expect your imagination to be so rich."
 

 
Using the latest cutting-edge consciousness scanning technology, the professional team was able to transform the images from Tong Zhao's mind into holographic recordings. This effectively gave birth to the prototype of a new world: "I’ve seen plenty of fantasy films, but the world you imagine is quite... disturbing."
 

 
Tong Zhao silently stared at him.
 

 
It was as if she had just given a sarcastic teammate a question mark in a game.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu met her gaze calmly: "Isn’t it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn't refute.
 

 
A month ago, it was... Iya, Sister Iya.
 

 
Iya: "It's Iya.”
 

 
Iya: "Don’t call me randomly, and no 'sister' either."
 

 
When Iya woke up, she had been searching for the right kind of antagonist. In the end, none of the scripts on the market suited her taste—she wanted a charming villain, one who could still captivate the audience even while committing evil deeds. After all, aren't movies and novels meant to provide enjoyment? In romance novels, the domineering CEO's forced love makes some readers swoon, and the obsessive, sickly types are all the rage. But if you meet such people in real life, the only thing you can say is "Run!"
 

 
The scripts that Tong Zhao flipped through generally had two types of villains:
 

 
1. The tool character.
 
2. The villain with a tragic backstory, inherently good at heart.
 

 
Iya wasn’t interested in the second type, claiming it went against the doctrine.
 

 
Iya: "Every person I kill when I’m in a frenzy, I hate them. This is the price I pay for accepting the Dark God's inheritance. The system has tried to remove it, but it only reduced the frequency of the episodes."
 

 
At first, she killed former cult members who had done many evil deeds, and Iya naturally hated them.
 

 
Later, however, she harmed herself.
 

 
She truly hated not noticing the truth of the Church sooner, and every moment when she failed to intervene in time.
 

 
So, the villain she would portray had to be someone who genuinely wanted to do evil—no tragic backstory, no redemption. Iya didn’t care whether the audience would hate the character. After all, it was just a performance; it wouldn't affect the actress personally. Tong Zhao had already played many likable, positive roles, but playing a major villain so early in her career needed more careful consideration.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a long time before finally going to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
She expressed all her requirements for the villain and then, slyly added, "I hope the audience will like her.”
 

 
This was a requirement that Iya hadn't mentioned.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao hoped the audience would like her.
 

 
The two of them hit it off right away. To discuss this matter, Shi Qianqiu had several video conferences with her. Each time, the background was different. Sometimes it was a sunny beach with his skin reddened by the sun, other times it was a freezing snow-covered landscape, and once, during a discussion about the character's details, the aurora lit up the sky behind him.
 

 
It was a sight that made people envious.
 

 
After several video meetings, Director Shi finally decided to focus and return home. He invited Tong Zhao to stay in one of his studios for about a week—along with his team. Their daily schedule consisted of brainstorming and refining the existing ideas.
 

 
What they ultimately settled on was a high-budget, special effects blockbuster.
 

 
A fantasy-themed film.
 

 
The worldview was provided by Tong Zhao, and Shi Qianqiu refined it.
 

 
They discussed whether to make it more complex or simpler.
 

 
Most big-budget films on the market are aimed at creating IP, so they naturally tend to be more complex. This way, it sets up potential sequels and the sale of merchandise. Additionally, the more complex the world-building, the more different it is from reality, making it easier for the audience to immerse themselves and believe that this is another world.
 

 
After seeing the world that Tong Zhao had "imagined," Shi Qianqiu chose the latter.
 

 
...
 

 
"The world you imagined has a fully developed system of evil."
 

 
"Under the banner of the God of Light, all the buildings appear luxurious and beautiful at first glance, even the poorest commoners value ritual. But as the story progresses, it unveils the dark and gloomy side of the world.”
 

 
"The world you've imagined has a unique and unified aesthetic, there’s no need to come up with a bunch of odd names to create a sense of mystery... I’ve always believed that those hard-to-remember names only serve to make it more difficult for the audience to write reviews, while creating a sense of superiority among the fanbase, making it a niche code of communication for this small circle."
 

 
"There’s really no need for that."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu set the tone for the new movie: "I want it to be a film where the audience can easily immerse themselves. When they think it's just a special effects action movie, the plot takes an unexpected turn and makes them question their life choices."
 

 
After hearing Shi Qianqiu’s grand theories, Tong Zhao gave him a blank stare.
 

 
Compared to Shi Qianqiu, even Jiang Dang could be described as cute.
 

 
There were so many people vying for a chance to audition that the team was overwhelmed. After much anticipation from the entire industry, the main cast was finally confirmed. When it came to casting, Tong Zhao didn’t give much input—after all, Shi Qianqiu was the one who had years of experience in selecting the right subconscious talents from auditions. One particularly strong statement from him was—
 

 
"I saw your potential before you even auditioned. Tell me, is it because my judgment is impeccable, or because you're just that impressive?"
 

 
Faced with the confident words of the great director Shi, Tong Zhao’s mood was a bit complicated. She felt a little like punching him.
 

 
What should she do if her own director was so punchable?
 

 
Waiting online, getting a bit urgent.
 

 
The production team’s WeChat group was one that Shi Qianqiu had added her to.
 

 
She usually kept quiet with strangers, so even though she was added, she wouldn’t have spoken unless necessary. However, once her name appeared, the group immediately exploded with messages welcoming her, especially from the male lead, Sun Sa.
 

 
Sun Sa: [Welcome, Sister Xiao Zhao!]
 

 
Sun Sa: [Sister Xiao Zhao, I'm your fan! Let's team up sometime! Please let me hug your thigh and rank up! I really love the role of the Imperial Concubine you played, and your little Zhao Zai, they're so cute. I’ve always dreamed of working with you. I can't believe my dream is finally coming true!]
 

 
Yu Zeqi: [Sister Xiao Zhao, don’t listen to him, he’s a dad fan, just wants to take advantage of you /dog head.]
 

 
Sun Sa, who wouldn’t turn 20 for another three months and was still attending film school, was over the moon after getting this huge opportunity. He was so excited, it almost felt like he was about to burst with happiness. His youthful enthusiasm was evident in his words, which made Shi Qianqiu a little annoyed and even more interested in tormenting him in the movie.
 

 
In the era of instinctual cinema, as long as the subconscious fit, it could even outweigh the drawbacks of inexperience.
 

 
After seeing Sun Sa, Tong Zhao understood why Shi Qianqiu had chosen him.
 

 
Other established actors just wouldn’t work.
 

 
They weren't as naive as him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Actually, if you’re looking for someone who’s both naive and handsome, I just thought of someone."
 

 
In the studio, Shi Qianqiu was fiddling with equipment. When he heard this, he glanced up at her: "Your little brat?"
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Yes, but I’m not recommending him, I just suddenly thought of him."
 

 
"I know, I’ve thought about him. He’s quite handsome, and his personality makes me want to bully him," only those particularly close to Shi Qianqiu knew that when he evaluated an actor’s potential, sometimes his criteria included whether he wanted to bully them in the film: "You two are too close, I’m worried it’ll affect his subconscious performance."
 

 
"Oh.”
 

 
Sun Sa had no idea that the director he admired so much, Shi Qianqiu, was secretly plotting ways to make him suffer in the holographic film. He was so excited that he couldn’t sleep well for three days. Everyone on his friend list knew by now that he had joined Shi Qianqiu’s new project and was even working with Tong Zhao. It was the opportunity of a lifetime!
 

 
This excitement lasted until he officially joined the crew and prepared to start filming.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu didn’t give the actors any scripts, claiming, "You’ll understand once you’re in."
 

 
Sun Sa didn’t suspect anything.
 

 
What bad intentions could Director Shi possibly have? After all, he was Sun Sa’s most respected idol!
 

 
And so, he happily climbed into the holographic filming pod.
 

 
---
 

 
Meanwhile, in her own holographic filming pod, Tong Zhao nervously ceded control to the alter personality, Iya. After weeks of preparation, Iya had been struggling to suppress her destructive urges. Her overwhelming desire for chaos had started to bleed into Tong Zhao's primary personality, to the point where even Tong Zhao herself found it hard to sleep.
 

 
Inside her mental palace, Tong Zhao's sleek, graceful figure could often be seen sprawled over a couch, lightly gasping for breath like a fish out of water.
 

 
Iya: [I’m fine.]
 

 
Her tone carried the full weight of "I'm so done—let the world burn."
 

 
When the machinery began to operate, all the actors’ consciousnesses gradually blurred, as though being pulled into the depths of an endless ocean.
 

 
---
 

 
Cast List:
 

 
- Sun Sa as Dion
 

 
- Tong Zhao as Iya
 

 
- Yu Zeqi as Norlens
 

 
...followed by a long list of other actors.
 

 
---
 

 
The story is set in a fictional world on the continent of Garan.
 

 
Fantasy films often evoke images of Western elements like wizards and knights, so having Eastern actors portray such characters might feel somewhat out of place. But would Shi Qianqiu be the type of person to care about such things? He believed that fiction is fiction—it isn't Eastern nor Western. It's a story that unfolds in another dimension.
 

 
The protagonist, Dion, is an unremarkable young noble.
 

 
Though he is called a noble, it really just means he’s a bit wealthier than most people, with a relatively "noble" family name. Because of his distant relation to the main branch, he hasn't enjoyed much of the extravagant, decadent life of nobility. He’s never had to worry about basic needs, though. He only stands out because he has an exceptionally handsome face, which often makes him the target of jealousy from the main house's aristocrats.
 

 
Despite this, it has not affected his cheerful disposition and strong sense of justice.
 

 
Dion worships the God of Light.
 

 
His affinity with the God of Light is extremely high, and his faith is far stronger than his peers’.
 

 
Through Dion’s perspective, the world and background are lightly introduced.
 

 
Neither is particularly complex.
 

 
The more complicated a world is, the easier it is to find its flaws and contradictions. So, Shi Qianqiu chose the opposite approach: rather than complicating things, he used the visual spectacles created from Tong Zhao’s imagination to pull the audience into another world...
 

 
This December, the once-in-a-decade Red Moon will descend.
 

 
When the Red Moon appears, it marks the peak of the Dark God’s power. The sky will be covered with the blood-red moon, and dark creatures will wreak havoc across the entire continent of Garan. The followers of the God of Light will fight relentlessly to protect the capital.
 

 
This is a tradition in the capital, and Dion believes in it firmly.
 

 
He also hopes to join the ranks of the Holy Knights.
 

 
Moreover, the Pope has prophesied that this year’s Red Moon will be far more severe than previous ones...
 

 
Due to his excellent performance, Dion passes some smaller trials and earns the qualification to become a Holy Knight—
 

 
This part of the story progresses very quickly. The trials are challenging but not overly difficult. If the crew hadn’t already known what happens later in the script, they might’ve questioned whether these plot points were even written by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
After all, Shi Qianqiu... would he really come up with problems that could be solved so easily?
 

 
He’s too much of a people pleaser!
 

 
This kind of plot is just not his style!
 

 
It feels off.
 

 
The beginning of the film's shoot felt like a fairy tale, with stunning architecture and an atmosphere as sacred as the sound of Brahman. Even though the name "God of Light" seemed a bit casually chosen, under the modelers' atmospheric design, the viewers could still feel the devotion of each character. The people of this continent deeply trusted the church and the God of Light...
 

 
This was, of course, intentional.
 

 
Because Shi Qianqiu had implanted faith commands into the subconscious minds of the extras. There was no need for any acting—the extras, in every moment of the holographic shoot, were devout followers, as if brainwashed. They never questioned the reality of the God of Light, and praying was as natural as eating, drinking, or using the restroom—it was an everyday task, something they did without thinking.
 

 
Through this method, the "brainwashed" effect that Tong Zhao wanted was achieved.
 

 
When the lighting and music were bright and cheerful, the atmosphere felt like a fairy tale.
 

 
The main plot of the film revolves around the upcoming arrival of the Red Moon. The entire nation is preparing for the onslaught of dark creatures. The Pope suggests that if they can travel deep into the Darkflower Forest and destroy one of the Dark God’s remaining temples, the strength of the dark creatures that are born will be reduced...
 

 
The Darkflower Forest is home to many dark creatures, making it extremely dangerous.
 

 
Due to the Dark God's barrier, anyone with weak faith who enters will be mentally deceived. Only those who pass certain trials can enter, and the number of people allowed is limited. If too many people go, the self-protecting mechanism of the Darkflower Forest will be triggered, and the army will be forcefully expelled—
 

 
So the question arises: If the barrier is so powerful, why not just stay in the capital?
 

 
Why go to the Darkflower Forest as a suicide soldier? Even if they were willing, their families wouldn’t permit it.
 

 
"During the auditions, many of the actors didn’t have the courage in their subconscious."
 

 
A modeler, watching the filming from backstage, complained, “Actually, all Director Shi needs to do is reduce the fear factor of the Darkflower Forest in their minds. It's all adjustable."
 

 
The assistant director shook his head in disagreement. "Someone like Sun Sa, who knows there's a tiger on the mountain but is so easily swayed by justice that he walks straight into the tiger's den, is exactly the type Director Shi likes!"
 

 
"You call Sun Sa a fool?"
 

 
"I mean he's a hero, a brave soul."
 

 
"I clearly heard you just say..."
 

 
"No, you didn't."
 

 
Though Sun Sa wasn’t a big celebrity with a powerful background, the assistant director felt a bit awkward for blurting that out and realized it was impolite.
 

 
However, as the director in charge of the entire production, Shi Qianqiu still sat in his director’s chair, biting into a red apple. He stared at the shooting screen, lost in thought, seemingly unaware of their casual conversation.
 

 
Meanwhile, the filming progressed to the part where Sun Sa’s character, Dion, took on the nearly suicidal mission.
 

 
“Hahahahaha!”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu took a bite of half an apple and slapped his thigh, “Fool!”
 

 
Within that burst of laughter, there was a hint of affection.
 

 
“...”
 

 
The other staff members fell silent.
 

 
Now, back to the movie.
 

 
Another actor, Yu Zeqi, playing Norence, also passed the test. Though she wasn’t as brave as Sun Sa, under the background setup, she had her own reasons for going—if she succeeded in the mission, even if she didn’t survive, her family would receive a large amount of compensation. Moreover, her brother had died in the Darkflower Forest, and she was determined to find out what kind of place it really was.
 

 
With the knights and mages in place, the church finally assigned them a red-robed saintess.
 

 
The saintess specialized in healing and purification magic.
 

 
It was said that this saintess came from a faraway village, and after going through numerous trials, she had finally made it to the capital’s temple. However, due to some misdeed, she had been marginalized. Though she wasn’t outright eliminated, she was still assigned to a mission like this, to the Darkflower Forest...
 

 
It was almost as if they were sending her to her death.
 

 
...
 

 
“Hey, what do you think the saintess will be like?”
 

 
Norence was getting a bit irritated thinking about how her "death day" was approaching. She was skilled with water magic, and if it weren’t for the urgent need for money at home to treat an illness, she wouldn’t have come on this trip. She was hoping to see a powerful saintess who could increase their team’s chances of survival.
 

 
“I don’t know.”
 

 
Dion shook his head.
 

 
Saintesses rarely appeared outside the temple, and they would never casually converse with strange men. He had only seen the saintess from a distance during the Light Festival.
 

 
The one he saw back then was a true saintess.
 

 
The one assigned to them, at best, could only be considered a contender for the position of saintess.
 

 
“Don’t you fear death?” Norence asked irritably.
 

 
“Of course I fear it, but…”
 

 
Dion, the "fool," placed his hand on the knight’s sword at his waist and solemnly declared, “To defend the glory of the Light God, it is our duty!”
 

 
Norence was speechless.
 

 
Off-camera, Shi Qianqiu was laughing so hard that he couldn’t even eat his apple anymore.
 

 
Others were puzzled.
 

 
Sun Sa was handsome, the kind of handsome with sharp brows and bright eyes, the youthful, composed type. So when he said these words, it came from a deep sense of duty. Where’s the joke in that? After laughing, Shi Qianqiu instructed the stage crew, "Make a note of this. He needs a fitting background music; without it, this line sounds too cringey."
 

 
Norence was at a loss for words for a moment when the church’s clergy appeared with the saintess.
 

 
When it was time for Tong Zhao to make her entrance, Shi Qianqiu put down his apple and didn’t miss a single frame. He was clearly excited, like an artisan who had just gotten the perfect materials…
 

 
Iya was a very special character.
 

 
Even Shi Qianqiu had reservations about whether Tong Zhao’s subconscious could deliver the performance he wanted.
 

 
The assistant director even directly said he didn’t think Tong Zhao was suitable.
 

 
With such a high investment, they should have chosen a safer option. However, taking a step back, even if Tong Zhao didn’t portray Iya the way they originally intended, it would be entirely possible to adjust the script for her.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao’s box office draw was undeniable—changing the script would be nothing.
 

 
When the clergy brought the saintess onto the set, Norence’s eyes filled with disappointment.
 

 
The young girl seemed very young, frail as if a gust of wind could knock her over. Her eyes were covered. Even without seeing her expression, one could sense her timid, fearful nature from her body language. She kept her head down, as if she feared the presence of the two others.
 

 
“…My name is Iya.”
 

 
…
 

 
This was also the reason the assistant director didn’t think Tong Zhao could pull off Iya.
 

 
He was actually a fan of hers, a big fan.
 

 
He had recorded ‘One Life Survivor’ and watched it over and over again. A fierce woman who could single-handedly kill twenty enemies—could her subconscious be weak?
 

 
If she wasn’t weak enough, the audience wouldn’t be able to let their guard down.
 

 
And the girl who appeared on screen now was clearly a textbook example of weakness—beautiful but otherwise useless.
# Chapter129
When the filming ended, Sun Sa woke up with a start.
 

 

 

 
He pressed his hand to his chest, and the motion caused a tangle of wires and equipment attached to his body.
 

 

 

 
“Ah... damn…”
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa raised his hand and rubbed his forehead.
 

 

 

 
The stagehand handed him a warm towel to wipe his face.
 

 

 

 
After wiping his face, he did indeed feel better, but a huge sense of emptiness still filled his chest. He had some experience with instinctive films during his school days. Although the length and intensity couldn’t compare to a full-fledged shoot, he at least knew what the feeling was like after filming an instinctive movie.
 

 

 

 
Although his memory hadn’t fully recovered, the experiences from the "dream" remained, about one-tenth of it, with those more susceptible to dream influence feeling it more deeply. From Sun Sa’s past experience, he wasn’t particularly sensitive. Even after going through the trauma of losing his family during filming, he would only feel slightly down afterward. A quick face wash and he could head out to play a murder mystery game with friends, go clubbing, or enjoy a hotpot.
 

 

 

 
But now…
 

 

 

 
The stagehand watched the young, handsome guy, who was now dejected and gloomy, and couldn’t help but ask, “Do you need to apply for psychological counseling?”
 

 

 

 
For large productions like ‘The Iya Myth’, a team doctor was essential.
 

 

 

 
To prevent any psychological issues from arising in the instinctive actors.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, then shook his head. “No, it’s not necessary…”
 

 

 

 
In fact, needing psychological counseling was a very normal demand. But this was Sun Sa’s first time acting in an instinctive film, and he didn’t want others to think he was being too difficult. So after wiping his face, he went back to the dorm room arranged for him by the production team and silently lay down on the bed for a while.
 

 

 

 
He couldn’t sleep.
 

 

 

 
His chest felt tight and heavy.
 

 

 

 
After tossing and turning in bed for a while, Sun Sa went to the automatic vending machine in the hallway to buy cigarettes and a lighter. He had quit smoking for a long time, but today, he felt so frustrated that he couldn’t get through it without a cigarette. He returned to his room, lit up, and smoked one cigarette after another until the entire pack was gone. His throat felt tight and sore.
 

 

 

 
At his worst, Sun Sa’s smoking addiction wasn’t even this bad.
 

 

 

 
Finishing a whole pack in one go made him feel like he was going to throw up. He grabbed some candy provided by the dormitory, chewed it, but it had no taste.
 

 

 

 
He thought for a moment and finally decided to reach out to his manager for help.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [Brother Chen, I’ve finished filming.]
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa: [I feel worse than eating shit right now.]
 

 

 

 
The manager was shocked but also a little amused. How could anyone describe themselves like that? Still, he patiently comforted him for a while, reassuring him that it would get better once the film was released. Sun Sa had a vague sense that once his memories returned, he would feel even worse than he did now.
 

 

 

 
Brother Chen: [Look on the bright side, once the movie comes out and you become famous, none of this will matter.]
 

 

 

 
Indeed, who doesn’t love fame and fortune?
 

 

 

 
Thinking about the fame and more acting opportunities coming his way, Sun Sa felt a little uplifted.
 

 

 

 
Like many people who ignore their emotional problems, he thought the public would be happy for his wealth and recognition, so he had no reason to be unhappy. He chose to suppress his “sensitive” thoughts and tried to stay on track...
 

 

 

 
---
 

 

 

 
‘The Iya Myth’ has wrapped up filming and editing begins!
 

 

 

 
A large-scale fantasy production, extravagant special effects, an independent worldview, and a powerful collaboration between Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu...
 

 

 

 
This time, Shi Qianqiu boldly lowered the rental rate of the material code to below 30%, meaning 70% of the code for ‘The Iya Myth’ was custom-built by the production team. This required not only manpower and resources, but also Shi Qianqiu’s confidence in his team’s abilities. If this film becomes a hit, even if he never directs again, just taking on outsourcing projects could earn him sky-high fees!
 

 

 

 
He was taking a huge gamble.
 

 

 

 
Making an instinctive film was always a gamble, and Shi Qianqiu, in particular, was a gambler who loved to bet everything on a single throw.
 

 

 

 
Someone dug up Shi Qianqiu's personal signature:
 

 

 

 
"Gambling is about restraint, low cost is the real indulgence."
 

 

 

 
What does that mean? The logic and phrasing are complete nonsense.
 

 

 

 
A netizen pointed out that he must still be thinking about ‘The Neverland Girl’, which was his lowest-cost film, and this time, with ‘The Iya Myth’, he’s finally getting the chance to shine.
 

 

 

 
[Wow, he truly deserves the title of the man who burns the most money in the film industry.]
 

 

 

 
[Zhao Zhao is probably the woman who makes the most money in the film industry, right?]
 

 

 

 
[If ‘The Iya Myth’ becomes a hit, she’ll probably be the box office queen this year.]
 

 

 

 
[The person above clearly hasn’t been keeping up with the numbers. If ‘The Iya Myth’ doesn’t blow up, she’ll still be the box office queen. If it does blow up, she’s already reserved the spot for the annual champion, ignoring gender. No man can beat her.]
 

 

 

 
Movies with a male lead are more common than those with a female lead — that’s the ceiling for actresses.
 

 

 

 
How many big female-lead films are there in a year? It’s impossible for all of them to be taken by Tong Zhao. But since she’s so good at making money and has connections, she started producing her own films, making them for herself without needing to cater to anyone’s preferences.
 

 

 

 
‘The Neverland Girl’ was Tong Zhao’s first film as a producer. Entertainment forums had hot posts calculating its cost and profits, and the return on investment was so high that netizens were amazed, lamenting how easy it is to make money in the entertainment industry.
 

 

 

 
Immediately, industry insiders rolled their eyes and replied.
 

 

 

 
They didn’t say much, just posted about this year’s instinctive films that bombed, showing how much they lost.
 

 

 

 
For every flop, it usually takes one and a half successful films to make up for the loss.
 

 

 

 
There will always be winners, but no one wins forever.
 

 

 

 
[But isn’t it true that Tong Zhao has never lost?]
 

 

 

 
[……]
 

 

 

 
[Aren’t we supposed to be discussing Shi Qianqiu here?]
 

 

 

 
[Has he never lost?]
 

 

 

 
The conversation couldn't continue after this, and the post discussing the data ended up turning into a lemon orchard, where people had to admit that some individuals are just born to conquer audiences.
 

 

 

 
There’s no doubt that the core of the discussion about ‘The Iya Myth’ is Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
However, a recent piece of negative news has caused even more heated discussions —
 

 

 

 
“‘The Iya Myth’ male lead Sun Sa suffers from a mental disorder!”
 

 

 

 
The news was exposed by a malicious media outlet known for using various borderline legal tactics to obtain sensational stories. This time, they revealed a wiretapping scandal and traced it back to Sun Sa's secondary Weibo account.
 

 

 

 
When a scandal breaks out, a typical male celebrity's secondary Weibo account might contain sweet messages with a mistress.
 

 

 

 
But what about Sun Sa?
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe (LittleWindNotHappy):
 

 

 

 
I can't let go, I think about her every night. I can’t move on, I can’t get out.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
Why do I have to suffer like this? She really is my ideal type.
 

 

 

 
@XiaoFengBuKuaiLe:
 

 

 

 
I want to write your name on a cigarette and inhale it into my lungs.
 

 

 

 
Before filming ‘The Iya Myth’, Sun Sa was a typical film school student with no messy girlfriend fanbase. So, this secondary account leak didn’t cause a mass unfollow — after all, he had no fans to begin with. But this heavy-hearted post on Weibo intrigued netizens, sparking curiosity.
 

 

 

 
[Who is this “she”?]
 

 

 

 
[I'm so curious about who made this guy care so much.]
 

 

 

 
[Why call yourself Xiao Feng? Is it because you can't stand up anymore?] 
 

 

 

 
[The person above is just like the car that goes to kindergarten/(dog emoji)] 
 

 

 

 
[Though, that line about inhaling it into the lungs really felt so corny, patting the little brother’s head.] 
 

 

 

 
The ambiguous posts on his secondary Weibo account were unclear, but the leaked wiretap audio cleared up the confusion— 
 

 

 

 
— “I’ve been thinking about Sister Xiao Zhao all day.” 
 

 
— “I really want to go on variety shows to promote, I can’t wait to be in the same frame as her, but I’m also afraid to meet her in person.” 
 

 
— “Because maybe what I like is the character she plays... I wish it wouldn’t end... but if it doesn’t end, it doesn’t really make a difference.” 
 

 
— “I have to take melatonin to fall asleep.” 
 

 

 

 
The audio was very clear. Fortunately, even though he was dealing with emotional issues, Sun Sa still remembered his confidentiality agreement and didn’t reveal the source of his distress. So even though the conversation was wiretapped and leaked, it didn’t spoil the plot of the new film, but it did provide an additional topic for discussion.
 

 

 

 
After the news broke, the ‘The Iya Myth’ team immediately arranged psychological counseling for Sun Sa. 
 

 

 

 
It was then discovered that, despite his agent saying that it would pass, Sun Sa had not only tasted the bitterness of fame, but was still troubled. Because of the deep suppression and his constant denial of his emotional problems, the emotional strain had accumulated to the point of almost festering. Afterward, Sun Sa felt very guilty and apologized profusely to Tong Zhao, who told him to focus on recovering: “This shows how desperately the media wanted news about ‘The Iya Myth’… they’d go to such lengths... It’s not your fault; who could’ve predicted this? But next time you’re filming a holographic movie, make sure to consult with a doctor if needed—emotions are never trivial.”
 

 

 

 
Of course, it wasn’t his fault. 
 

 

 

 
The blame lay with the intrusive paparazzi. 
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao even felt a little sorry. This wasn’t something a newcomer should have to face... he had only just turned twenty, and all of this was because this was her movie. People were willing to go to any lengths to get news related to her. However, considering the rewards he could gain from ‘The Iya Myth’, this small suffering was nothing in comparison. 
 

 

 

 
So, during the meeting, Tong Zhao’s words, which were about to be spoken, reverted to a cold tone:
 

 

 

 
"With ‘The Iya Myth’, both my and Sun Sa's Baidu indexes have been rising rapidly. On the bright side, we’re not without benefits; even if rumors about us circulate, it won’t affect me." From an objective perspective, this was even a win-win type of publicity; the only thing that was harmed was Sun Sa’s mental health—the feeling of his personal privacy being violated made him more uneasy, as he was already struggling with emotional issues: "Now, there are two options: either not clarify the rumors and continue the gossip about me and him..."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao had a mature PR and marketing team, who earned a generous fee each year to handle such public relations crises.
 

 

 

 
As her status rose, her team also began to take her feelings more into consideration.
 

 

 

 
Everyone quietly listened to her decision.
 

 

 

 
"My answer is no. The film's quality is excellent, and there's no need to use this type of news to promote it. That would just play into the paparazzi’s hands. Let’s redirect the focus back to the film itself. We can clarify that Sun Sa is obsessed with the character I play in the movie—he even mentioned it in the audio recording. Outside of the movie, it's not the same thing."
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t try to exaggerate her tone.
 

 

 

 
She remained calm and composed, delivering her words decisively, and no one in the room challenged her stance.
 

 

 

 
At the right moment, Shi Qianqiu interjected to ease the atmosphere: "We can create a smoke screen, let the netizens believe that ‘The Iya Myth’ is a particularly sweet romance between the male and female leads."
 

 

 

 
Those who had seen the original film gave him a look of approval. 
 

 

 

 
Such a sharp move, Director Shi!
 

 

 

 
The head of the PR team nodded: "We can arrange that. The data shows that the netizens' attitude is still relatively calm, and the mainstream voice is condemning the media for using wiretapping to get news about a new actor who's only twenty years old. Some fans also don’t want you to choose..."
 

 

 

 
He paused for a moment: "A boyfriend weaker than Xiao Zhao."
 

 

 

 
In Eastern cultures, people tend to subconsciously disapprove of relationships where the woman is stronger than the man.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao gestured to indicate that she no longer wanted to discuss the matter.
 

 

 

 
The team quickly picked up on the hint and steered the conversation back to how to manage the public relations.
 

 

 

 
*
 

 

 

 
The clarification of the rumors about Tong Zhao and Sun Sa happened quickly.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao herself did not speak out, which in itself was a statement— 
 

 

 

 
The matter was trivial, laughably false. Did they really think they could get her to respond by using cheap tactics? Go back and think about whether they even deserved her attention. The PR team then issued a statement through the film’s channels that afternoon. First, they condemned the wiretapping as an invasion of privacy, then mentioned that Sun Sa was actively seeking psychological treatment after the filming, asking everyone to focus on the new movie instead.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa did not appear, but a reporter released a video of him being interviewed outside his building. In the video, the young man looked dejected and visibly worn out, which immediately sparked netizens' sympathy.
 

 

 

 
Soon after, a version of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was released.
 

 

 

 
How touching must the movie be for a handsome young man like him to be so affected by it?
 

 

 

 
The quality of the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer was top-notch, merely revealing a glimpse of the scenery in the film, but it quickly shifted the focus of the viewers.
 

 

 

 
In the trailer, Sun Sa’s character, Dion, is dressed in a platinum-colored knight's armor, holding Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
The official stills for ‘The Iya Myth’ hadn't been released yet.
 

 

 

 
This was the first time netizens had seen Tong Zhao's look in the new film.
 

 

 

 
In this shot, she slightly lowers her long, elegant neck, her delicate, fair shoulder trembling slightly in the wind, exuding a sense of fragility. When she lifts her head, she reveals her eyes hidden behind a lace eye mask, covering her usual electrifying gaze and making her appear even more vulnerable.
 

 

 

 
["Their mission is to destroy the temple of the Dark God, but Dion secretly vows in his heart as a knight—"]
 

 

 

 
["He must protect the Holy Lady."]
 

 

 

 
Next, the female antagonist Norence's loud shout:
 

 

 

 
["She's just a useless burden who only holds us back! Don’t you understand? We should leave her here—"]
 

 

 

 
Just as the words end, Iya softly pulls on the male lead's sleeve: "Don’t leave me..."
 

 

 

 
This should have seemed very cliché.
 

 

 

 
However, Tong Zhao was simply too beautiful. Watching this scene, netizens, both male and female, couldn’t help but sympathize with the male lead, feeling protective of the delicate beauty. After all, it’s a movie, and the protagonist will always overcome adversity, right? What’s wrong with taking care of the little beauty? Of course, to make it seem like Tong Zhao wasn’t just a burden, the trailer also cleverly included scenes where her character points the way for the team, suggesting that she is actually quite useful.
 

 

 

 
The trailer was packed with information. Netizens only knew that the main team was undertaking a dangerous mission, with Tong Zhao playing the Holy Lady, who possesses healing magic. She is frail, kind, and gentle, earning the approval of the initially hostile female antagonist by protecting her teammates.
 

 

 

 
The trailer ends with Tong Zhao getting injured while protecting the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Blood slowly trickles down from her head, staining her platinum hair and fair face. The male lead, filled with pity and heartache, gently caresses her cheek and kisses her forehead.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
[Isn't this just as intense as ‘Boruto: Naruto Next Generations’?]
 

 

 

 
[What just happened? I feel like I’ve been sweetened. The plot seems a bit simple, but with her looks alone, it’s worth it.]
 

 

 

 
[I thought I was already immune to Tong Zhao’s beauty, but I didn’t expect her to reach new heights in her new movie. Is that platinum-colored hair real? I can totally understand why Sun Sa couldn’t move on after filming, and also, Xiao Sa’s looks are amazing, he really could be in an idol drama.]
 

 

 

 
[You guys only noticed the looks of the leads? Did you forget about the 70% exclusive set codes promoted for ‘The Iya Myth’? These are scenes you can only see in this movie! Several wide shots are so beautiful and luxurious, no wonder they match Shi Qianqiu’s taste; it's absolutely perfect.]
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
The comments are all praises.
 

 

 

 
For a big-budget commercial film like ‘The Iya Myth’, most of the audience comes to enjoy the spectacle. The holographic immersive experience and a bit of fresh innovation in the storyline, as long as they don’t feed us nonsense, it’s already good enough. The trailer only gave the main storyline, revealing very little of the plot, but the visuals were clearly meticulously crafted, the budget is ample, and it made viewers want to buy the holographic movie rights and continue following its release...
 

 

 

 
This is the mainstream opinion.
 

 

 

 
And Tong Zhao’s fans, especially the beauty-focused ones, are absolutely satisfied!
 

 

 

 
It’s as if overnight, the entire Weibo and some entertainment forums were filled with discussions about the ‘The Iya Myth’ trailer. Sun Sa, as expected, reaped the benefits of being tied to Tong Zhao. Plus, he’s really handsome, and under Shi Qianqiu’s direction, he particularly gives off that "knight in shining armor" vibe. His smile is full of sunshine, and he’s straightforward and clear-headed.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa has undeniably become the best on-screen partner for Tong Zhao since her debut.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang played the villain, and in the film, Tong Zhao had another boyfriend.
 

 

 

 
As for Han Zhi, well, that’s actually Tong Zhao herself.
 

 

 

 
When you count them all up, Sun Sa takes the top spot.
 

 

 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans are not too happy about it—
 

 

 

 
After all, when CPs are hyped, the lesser-known side is usually thrilled, while the popular side doesn't really want to be dragged along. But since the new film is coming out, and Sun Sa’s private social media posts were found to be quite fan-oriented, some of Tong Zhao’s fans could relate to him. So, the atmosphere among fans is somewhat harmonious, and there hasn't been much fighting.
 

 

 

 
However, the trailer and the official stills from ‘The Iya Myth’, with the two of them in the same frame, are just too perfect!
 

 

 

 
The pure and noble saintess, and the knight who only wants to protect the gods with an untainted heart—if this isn’t the perfect pairing, then what is? The official couple has the sky as their limit, with so much sweetness that you can't get enough of it!
 

 

 

 
[Isn’t a saintess paired with a little puppy dog charming?]
 

 

 

 
[If I want a little puppy dog, I’d rather go for the rich young master…]
 

 

 

 
[I just hope the newcomer doesn’t drag Tong Zhao down.]
 

 

 

 
At some point, whenever Tong Zhao makes a move, it feels like a national celebration. The internet is buzzing with discussions about her, and in real life, mentioning her name often sparks a conversation.
 

 

 

 
Just this level of popularity is priceless.
 

 

 

 
There’s no helping it—every time she has a new project, not only does she never disappoint, but she also constantly delivers surprises.
 

 

 

 
She’s the most watchable actor among the performers in the "Instinct" film series.
 

 

 

 
With overwhelming promotion, many audience members who pre-booked tickets are eager to witness the sweet romance and the magnificent otherworldly scenery. Even before the movie has been released, many already love Tong Zhao’s saintess look, which gives off a high-and-mighty vibe.
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
On the first day of the ‘The Iya Myth’ premiere, what was the audience's reaction after the first screening?
 

 

 

 
Their response was the same as Sun Sa’s that day.
 

 

 

 
Thousands of words turned into a single exclamation: "Wow!"
 

 

 

 
This "wow" made those who hadn’t managed to catch the first screening panic.
 

 

 

 
[Stop just saying "wow", give us some real content! I’m not afraid of spoilers!]
 

 

 

 
——[Don’t say you’re not afraid of spoilers, this movie really isn’t something you should watch after being spoiled. I suggest you go watch the first public screening ASAP, or you’ll be hit by spoilers everywhere. Seriously, it’s so damn… I’ll never believe in love again!]
 

 

 

 
Hearing this, some viewers thought the person was throwing a metaphorical knife.
 

 

 

 
What exactly was the situation?
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, who was resting at home, saw the first batch of movie reviews online and couldn't help but feel a sense of sympathy.
 

 

 

 
It was no use—every time he closed his eyes, he kept thinking about his saintess sister…
# Chapter130
Spoilers are inevitable.
 

 

 

 
Spoilers with a warning are a harmonious form of sharing, while spoilers without any warning may be due to a lack of awareness, or in some cases, from those who deliberately seek to upset others. And then there are those who, even as the movie is about to leave theaters, still criticize spoiler warnings. In short, human nature is such that it cannot be completely avoided.
 

 

 

 
However, with the rise of immersive films today, copyright awareness and viewing etiquette have both improved. The vast majority of people are now mindful of not spoiling movies or, at the very least, they give proper warnings when they do. The remaining few are those who deliberately seek to upset others, rushing to spoil the movie for fans who have been eagerly anticipating it but couldn't attend the premiere due to their work schedules.
 

 

 

 
So what is the true purpose of these malicious individuals?
 

 

 

 
Is it about spoiling the movie?
 

 

 

 
No, it's the thrill they get from successfully annoying others with the spoilers!
 

 

 

 
After watching 'The Iya Myth', these mischief-makers didn't escape the fate of being ironically punished by the ultimate behind-the-scenes boss, Shi Qianqiu, who left them utterly confused and humiliated. The more logical and justified his methods were, the harder it was for them to accept.
 

 

 

 
What were they thinking when they decided to spoil the movie?
 

 

 

 
If they spoiled it...
 

 

 

 
The viewers who later watched it would already be mentally prepared, carrying a protective shield with them, so they wouldn’t be as upset.
 

 

 

 
Is this good?
 

 

 

 
No, it’s not!!!
 

 

 

 
These little troublemakers, who thought they could annoy others through spoilers, all unknowingly closed their mouths.
 

 

 

 
If “throwing shade” were an art form, then Shi Qianqiu would be the master. His traditional skill was to coat the blade with the sweetest sugar, and Tong Zhao was the sharpest blade in his hands. Some fans were amused to find that 'The Iya Myth' didn’t have spoilers flying all over the place on its opening day. They were able to catch it after work, curious to see what it was all about.
 

 

 

 
Smiling when they entered the theater, and leaving with tears in their eyes.
 

 

 

 
A lively scene appeared in the review section—
 

 

 

 
"Can Shi Qianqiu just die?????"
 

 

 

 
"I’m so stupid, really, how could I believe in that old crook Shi's movie!"
 

 

 

 
"Summary of Shi Qianqiu's movie: A dazzling, jewel-encrusted knife."
 

 

 

 
"Isn’t this even more tear-jerking than ‘The Day of Becoming a God’???"
 

 

 

 
Even viewers who aren’t interested in fantasy genres were intrigued by the flood of angry comments, and started replying with questions: 
 

 
"Is the movie really bad? Did Tong Zhao’s reputation explode? Is the movie boring?"
 

 

 

 
Once the question about the movie's quality was raised, the viewers who had been furiously criticizing Shi Qianqiu suddenly fell silent, their attitudes shifting:
 

 

 

 
"The movie? It’s not bad, it’s really good..."
 

 

 

 
"But until you reach the end, you’ll never believe what kind of movie this is."
 

 

 

 
"You dare call this a love story?/dog head"
 

 

 

 
"There is love, and there’s definitely a lot of fantasy too. If you go just for the special effects, it’s worth it. Sister Zhao’s reputation didn’t explode, but her beauty and aura certainly did. Sigh, once you watch it, you’ll get it. I’m going for a second viewing, all for the saintess sister."
 

 

 

 
You can’t bully Shi Qianqiu for not having fans; he does have fans. On forums and Weibo, people started analyzing the movie: 
 

 

 

 
"Shi’s films, the first time you watch them, you watch the people, the second time, you watch the scenery, and the third time, you can actually understand the plot."
 

 

 

 
Not entirely clear, but it feels impressive.
 

 

 

 
Of course, it's not just word of mouth; the film’s marketing team didn’t spare any effort either. As soon as Sun Sa’s emotional state slightly stabilized, he and Tong Zhao appeared together on two variety shows. With an expensive promotional push, many fans who were already looking forward to Tong Zhao’s new work, along with curious netizens, bought the holographic movie tickets...
 

 

 

 
So what kind of movie 'The Iya Myth' actually is?
 

 

 

 
...
 

 

 

 
Due to its high investment, 'The Iya Myth' introduced the latest immersive viewing method.
 

 

 

 
This technology allows you to immerse yourself in a specific character, although you cannot speak or influence the plot. It’s like a solitary soul attaching itself to the character, experiencing the film from their first-person perspective, while also feeling their psychological changes. Due to the complexity of the technology, it can currently only be "possessed" by the main characters, as there isn’t enough data collected for supporting this technology with secondary characters.
 

 

 

 
Of course, this comes at an additional cost.
 

 

 

 
It’s a special service that traditional films cannot offer.
 

 

 

 
Because it’s very expensive, with high costs, only a few big-budget movies each year can afford to implement this.
 

 

 

 
So when 'The Iya Myth' only offered the option to experience the perspective of the male lead, Dion, there were some complaints, but most moviegoers agreed with the decision. After all, with the first-person perspective, you can't see "yourself," so whether they’re watching Tong Zhao or Sun Sa, most would still choose the former.
 

 

 

 
After all, the ticket price was a bit high, and those willing to pay for it were mostly doing so out of trust in Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu, or they were truly passionate about the immersive viewing experience.
 

 

 

 
So this group of core movie fans immersed themselves in the character of Dion.
 

 

 

 
Among them was also Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
This technology was so advanced that you couldn’t experience it at home with just a helmet; you had to go to the cinema. He thought it would be a bit sad to go alone, so he bought an extra ticket to invite his manager to come along. But his manager said it was inconvenient.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [What’s inconvenient about it?]
 

 

 

 
Manager: [I need to go with my wife, you can go to the cinema by yourself. It’s better if you don’t bring any girls.]
 

 

 

 
Subtext: You’ve got no one to go with, but I’ve got someone.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo immediately felt a little defeated.
 

 

 

 
Actually, going alone would be fine, but since he had already bought the ticket, he gave up and posted a moment on his social media, thinking, "What if fate steps in?" He had a lot of pretty girls on WeChat who chatted with him from time to time, but he wasn't interested. He always felt it was pointless.
 

 

 

 
Like many well-off single guys.
 

 

 

 
A psychological "sea king" but an action "lonely king."
 

 

 

 
Then, someone Song Wanzhuo never expected left a comment.
 

 

 

 
Not only that, but they also sent him a private message, with a voice note.
 

 

 

 
——[I’m free that day, we can watch it together.]
 

 

 

 
Such a gentle, sexy voice.
 

 

 

 
Too bad it was a guy.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Wait, Jiang Dang, are you sure you want to watch it with me????]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [What's wrong with that?]
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang: [A little kitten peeking out of the trash can.jpg]
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo: [Fine, fine, let’s go watch it. But don’t act cute, I’m not into that.]
 

 

 

 
It was just a meme saved casually, and Jiang Dang didn’t think he was acting cute. He was already planning to see Tong Zhao’s movie, and since he saw it on social media, he decided to invite Song Wanzhuo.
 

 

 

 
As for Song Wanzhuo, he was being more practical.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang was getting really popular lately, even more than him, so there was no harm in getting more familiar with him.
 

 

 

 
The two of them, fully armed, arrived at the cinema on the third day of 'The Iya Myth'’s release.
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's eyes, they began their adventure in the land of Garan.
 

 

 

 
The first fifteen minutes didn’t feature Tong Zhao.
 

 

 

 
"I can’t wait to see Tong Zhao, but the movie itself isn’t boring. While Dion is passing the test to earn his knight status, it also introduces the world-building. Such mature narrative shots, no wonder it’s directed by Shi Qianqiu," Song Wanzhuo rambled, commenting. The first fifteen minutes were very traditional for an action movie, with some flashy, expensive scenery: “Damn it, the male lead isn’t just a decoration in the movie, this newcomer is making a killing. I’m so jealous. How come this luck didn’t fall on me? I feel like my subconscious is quite similar to his.”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s subconscious image was quite mature.
 

 

 

 
He was a calm, composed, authoritative leader-type personality, with a touch of "bro culture."
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang nodded seriously: “Yeah, how come this kind of luck didn’t fall on me? My subconscious is also quite suitable for it.”
 

 

 

 
“...”
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo turned to look at him: “Are you serious?”
 

 

 

 
“Seriously.”
 

 

 

 
You might have a misunderstanding about what "subconscious" means…
 

 

 

 
After looking at that handsome face, which seemed oblivious to how problematic it was, Song Wanzhuo decided it was better to put on his helmet and focus on the movie.
 

 

 

 
The movie progressed to the point where the female lead, Iya, made her appearance.
 

 

 

 
In the immersive experience, the audience could fully feel the shock in the heart of the male lead, Dion, when he first saw the Saintess Iya.
 

 

 

 
Even without the immersive experience, just from the holographic viewing, they could still empathize with him.
 

 

 

 
How could it be more beautiful than the scenes in the trailer that had been enhanced?
 

 

 

 
The young girl stepped forward and bowed. The light from the temple illuminated her face, and for a moment, all the audience held their breath, unable to take their eyes off her. She was so fragile and delicate, every strand of her hair glowing as if bathed in light. The pity for the weak was not just a man's privilege; even the female audience members who came to the cinema with their boyfriends at this moment couldn’t help but feel the desire to engage in a yuri romance with her.
 

 

 

 
Being a beauty addict knows no gender.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo was the typical example of a straight man audience member who was struck by an aesthetic blow.
 

 

 

 
“My god… just watching her face alone makes it worth it. Wuwu, she should take more beautiful, beautiful movies like this, and fewer fighting action films. A woman’s gentleness and fragility are so alluring. I am just Dion, I want to protect the Saintess for the rest of my life!”
 

 

 

 
He whispered as he watched the movie.
 

 

 

 
Anyway, it was a private box, so it wouldn't disturb anyone else.
 

 

 

 
“She is indeed beautiful.”
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang paused: “But I think she’s also very charming when she’s fighting.”
 

 

 

 
Especially when she’s fighting against him.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s obsession with her looks was interrupted again.
 

 

 

 
Thankfully, the immersive experience, where he could enjoy Tong Zhao’s gentle words from the male lead’s perspective, was an absolute treat for a fanboy like him, making his desire to protect her grow to unprecedented levels.
 

 

 

 
The main plot of 'The Iya Myth' revolves around the crisis brought by the red moon and the Light Festival.
 

 

 

 
The Pope promises that if Iya completes her mission and returns alive, he will choose her to be the true Saintess of the Royal Church in the capital.
 

 

 

 
The main storyline and pacing of a commercial blockbuster are typically very clear, and this was a shared understanding among the audience. So when this "carrot" was dangled in front of them, they instinctively remembered it and confidently thought—yeah, this is probably the reward the protagonist will get in the grand finale, not bad at all.
 

 

 

 
The plotline follows the protagonist's team as they venture into the Dark Flower Forest to destroy the Dark Temple, with dangers in the forest serving as a secondary element of the story.
 

 

 

 
Mediocre movies often stretch the runtime, but excellent movies don’t have dull moments. 'The Iya Myth' has a fast-paced storyline. The main group quickly enters the Dark Flower Forest, introducing a new visual spectacle— 
 

 

 

 
Through Dion's perspective, a dense fog surrounds them, and Norence cautiously sets up a barrier. This young magician is soon horrified to find that his barrier is useless; they are pulled into an illusion.
 

 

 

 
In this illusion, it seems like they are flying, overlooking the entire Garan continent from above.
 

 

 

 
The continent starts with only animals and birds, but soon, human civilization emerges.
 

 

 

 
This is the perspective of the gods.
 

 

 

 
The viewing experience is so thrilling that Song Wanzhuo forgets he came to see his "wife." He is so excited that he can’t stop praising Shi Qianqiu, calling him the god of money-burning aesthetics.
 

 

 

 
So entering the Dark Flower Forest is like playing a simulation game from a god's perspective?
 

 

 

 
The main group witnesses the divine battle between two gods, and Song Wanzhuo, who bought the Dion perspective, feels emotionally charged. He wants to fight with the dark faction for 300 rounds. Dion feels the same way. He is a devout believer and has already made a vow in his heart that as long as he is alive, he will protect the Temple of Light with his life and never let the Dark God invade the capital again.
 

 

 

 
Iya says nothing but looks at him gently, her eyes filled with pity and affection.
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang’s heart stirs.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, however, is too caught up in the moment, floating on pink bubbles as he’s gazed at by the goddess: "I can’t handle this, I’m so smitten by the goddess, Jiang Dang, react to this!"
 

 

 

 
"What kind of reaction...?"
 

 

 

 
Jiang Dang looks a little dazed. After hesitating, he says, "It feels a bit like ‘Alice in Wonderland’."
 

 

 

 
Facing the conflict in the history of divine wars, the male protagonist unhesitatingly stands on the side of the God of Light.
 

 

 

 
In the "illusion," they arrive at the center of the Sea of Time and witness the scene of two gods negotiating. Though it is just a lingering illusion, the immense presence of these gods still carries an overwhelming pressure. The sun slowly rises from the east, and a golden line stretches along the horizon. Iya, seemingly unaffected by the divine pressure, walks lightly on the water’s surface as though she were an ant.
 

 

 

 
From the public perspective, the scene appears expansive, with Iya positioned between the two gods.
 

 

 

 
From Dion’s perspective…
 

 

 

 
He only saw the girl’s ethereal, elf-like beauty, and his heart felt as sweet as honey. Amidst the stunning visual spectacle, he could see only her, and his gaze was entirely captivated by her.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya turned around and flashed him a brilliant smile.
 

 

 

 
"Dion,"
 

 

 

 
"Is this what a god looks like?"
 

 

 

 
If falling in love had a sound, it must be the saint’s call of his name.
 

 

 

 
Up to this point, the movie was all sweetness.
 

 

 

 
Song Wanzhuo, a fan of the boyfriend character, was completely swept up in the sweetness. He imagined that his relationship with Tong Zhao should be like this—she is certainly capable, but he could also be her great hero in her world, saving the Galan continent. Though it seemed a bit cliché, what young person hasn’t dreamed of that? Becoming a great hero and embracing a beautiful woman.
 

 

 

 
The illusion’s mystery was solved, and they found the way to the Dark God’s temple.
 

 

 

 
They had to offer the heart of a believer of light to enter.
 

 

 

 
At this point, the audience finally let out a relieved breath.
 

 

 

 
In a Shi Qianqiu movie, if things aren’t stirring up some trouble, it’s just not right.
 

 

 

 
Wasn’t ‘Heartless Tribulation’ like that? It set up a trap for the protagonist.
 

 

 

 
"Hehe, the knife from Shi the Old Thief is finally here," Song Wanzhuo said with confidence, having seen ‘Heartless Tribulation’ before. "With little Sister Xiao Zhao here, what trap can’t she break? Can her subconscious be stopped?"
 

 

 

 
After attempting and failing to force his way through the door, before Iya could speak, Dion boldly volunteered to dig out his own heart. This greatly increased his appeal to many audience members who loved the innocent, big-hearted boy type.
 

 

 

 
— "No, I won’t let you sacrifice yourself."
 

 

 

 
Iya shook her head, still looking as fragile and beautiful as ever.
 

 

 

 
Her voice was clear and melodious, and anyone watching at this point would think she was about to sacrifice herself. The supporting character, Norence, who had initially held some prejudice against her, now felt deeply moved and ashamed, realizing how high the saint's level of self-awareness was.
 

 

 

 
Accompanied by solemn and heavy music, the audience remained calm, confident that Tong Zhao’s subconscious would find a way.
 

 

 

 
No director can ever outdo her!
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu surely values her ability to break through obstacles, right?
 

 

 

 
Haha, they think they can hurt us? No way.
 

 

 

 
We’re just waiting for Tong Zhao’s comeback. Ah, but the atmosphere is so touching; Dion and Iya make such a sweet couple…
 

 

 

 
The next moment, the music abruptly stopped.
 

 

 

 
— "Isn't there a ready one here?"
 

 

 

 
Iya asked in confusion, her voice as pure and innocent as always.
 

 

 

 
After being assigned to the role of the saint-in-training, these orphaned girls were well-protected and rarely seen by outsiders. As a result, Iya always appeared naive and innocent, unaware of the ways of the world. Norence had always found this trait annoying, thinking that Iya didn't understand the hardships of the world, which made her seem pretentious and annoying, almost like an out-of-touch princess.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, Iya reached out with an empty hand—
 

 

 

 
‘Puff’.
 

 

 

 
A small, still-beating red heart appeared in her snow-white, delicate hand.
 

 

 

 
Before Norence could ask why, she stared at Iya in shock.
 

 

 

 
Just like the countless audience members, she was bewildered and unable to comprehend what was happening, her breath halting in fear and despair as she collapsed in the mud.
 

 

 

 
The audience wondered, ‘Is Tong Zhao breaking character?’ From her subconscious performance in ‘One Life Survivor', it’s possible she could make a move like this—sacrificing her teammates with the knife. With her somewhat indifferent sense of good and evil, she didn’t seem to be a good fit for the character of Iya…
 

 

 

 
As these thoughts raced through their minds, Iya placed the still-dripping heart in the center of the door.
 

 

 

 
"Do you know why only those who maintain a devout faith in the God of Light can enter the Flowering Fog Forest? Because the key to open the temple is the heart of the faithful," Iya continued softly, without any background music. Her enchanting voice was more captivating than any melody: "I didn’t want you to be the sacrifice..."
 

 

 

 
Dion finally understood.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, he still didn’t believe Iya was a bad person. He thought she had killed to protect him. He lifted his teammate’s body and moved it aside, so it wouldn’t be swallowed by the mud. Then he hurriedly chased after Iya to question her.
 

 

 

 
The interior of the Dark God’s temple was complex, but the Saintess seemed as though she had returned home.
 

 

 

 
"Protect you? No," 
 

 

 

 
Iya glanced at him in surprise, almost finding it amusing. "For someone like you, it must hurt more for your teammates to sacrifice themselves for you than for you to sacrifice yourself, right? For Norence, she values her life above all. Even if she considers you a friend, she would rather be the one who survives when it comes to choosing between the two of you."
 

 

 

 
Under Dion’s frantic gaze, he saw the bloodstained hem of her white dress.
 

 

 

 
She was still beautiful, breathtakingly so.
 

 

 

 
But now, he couldn’t understand her anymore.
 

 

 

 
Iya’s tone was light and ethereal, and even her voice seemed to echo in the vast temple. "Seeing her desire to live like this, I just want her to die.”
 

 

 

 
At this moment, even the audience who had the most faith in Tong Zhao knew something was off.
 

 

 

 
However, the pacing of this scene was very fast, not giving the audience any time to pause and think. Iya entered the temple, activated the magic circle, and accepted the Dark God’s inheritance. At this point, both the male lead and the audience were reminded of what seemed like a dull world-building exposition at the beginning of the film…
 

 

 

 
So, the trap was buried here?
 

 

 

 
Turns out, this handsome guy betrayed the revolution?
 

 

 

 
Iya showed him the perspective of the Dark God’s war.
 

 

 

 
At this moment, the audience thought:
 

 

 

 
Hmm, there’s a twist. The Dark God is actually a good guy, with his own reasons.
 

 

 

 
Did Shi Qianqiu really think he could fool the audience?
 

 

 

 
The Dark God is indeed the embodiment of evil, with no redeeming qualities.
 

 

 

 
However, a hundred years ago, the Dark God no longer existed on the continent of Galan.
 

 

 

 
The God of Light had long since abandoned its followers.
 

 

 

 
The Red Moon's arrival was a scheme orchestrated by the Church to summon dark creatures, causing widespread devastation, all to intimidate the king and make him obedient to the Pope and the Church.
 

 

 

 
— "Since both the guards and the ones worshiping are false gods who love to cause disasters, why not just worship me?"
 

 

 

 
— "I am the new god of the Galan continent."
 

 

 

 
— "And I will be your only faith."
 

 

 

 
The Saintess, now with the Dark God's inheritance, wore a white gown that instantly turned black, like ink wrapping around her delicate, snow-white figure. Her logic was easy to understand: the Church had always been creating "natural disasters" to secure their position, right? Well, she would give them exactly what they wanted. The real Dark God arrived with the Red Moon, and now it’s time to kneel and worship her!
 

 

 

 
Dion was confused.
 

 

 

 
Of course, at this point, the movie was only halfway through.
 

 

 

 
The audience could tell from the runtime that there was still time left for a comeback and reversal.
 

 

 

 
Iya let him go, allowing him to safely return to the capital with Norence’s body.
 

 

 

 
Along with him came the news of the Dark God’s arrival on the Galan continent. Inside the Church, everything seemed calm. They thought their "false appearance" had succeeded, until dark creatures attacked on a scale far beyond their expectations, and they realized they had overplayed their hand.
 

 

 

 
Shi Qianqiu truly had a great eye for talent.
 

 

 

 
Sun Sa, the little friend, is a righteous companion with an unprecedented sense of duty. He believes that since he has learned the truth, he has an obligation to correct the wrongs. With such a strong sense of justice, it's a waste of talent if he doesn't do some quick transmigration. After a series of struggles, the truth of the Church's deceitful actions was revealed by the male lead, but even though the former Dark God was fake, the current Dark Saintess is real!
 

 

 

 
The birth of the Dark God means endless war and suffering.
 

 

 

 
The responsibility to slay the gods once again falls on the male lead.
 

 

 

 
Iya, who has just received the inheritance, is not yet at the strength of a god. She only has the ability to summon dark creatures. All they need to do is find her and figure out a way to kill her. The male lead shoulders the hope of the entire capital, but all the audience who bought the immersive experience knows that he is still in love with her.
 

 

 

 
He doesn't even want to win; he'd rather die at her hands.
 

 

 

 
But his sense of justice drives him to give everything he has, without holding back.
 

 

 

 
The movie is a commercial film, and Shi Qianqiu is always good at delivering on the "satisfaction" aspect.
 

 

 

 
After overcoming many hardships, the male lead arrived at the site of the ultimate battle—according to the literature he had found and deciphered, it was best to rest at the place where the old gods' aura was the strongest after receiving the divine inheritance. Thus, he found the center of the Sea of Time, the place where the two gods had departed…
 

 

 

 
This is the first time he had truly reached the core of the Sea of Time.
 

 

 

 
The last time was only in an illusion.
 

 

 

 
Countless audience members, along with Dion, saw his beloved.
 

 

 

 
Iya took the red crescent moon from the sky and used it as a seat, resting her long legs on the tail of the red moon. It glowed with a cold light, casting her pale white skin like snow. Her platinum blonde curls fell across her small, rounded shoulders, and when she heard the sound, she turned around and smiled:
 

 

 

 
“You really came.”
 

 

 

 
This scene was not designed by Shi Qianqiu.
 

 

 

 
He has good taste, but he never expected her to be so bold as to take the moon and use it as a mount.
 

 

 

 
This was a habit Iya had developed over the long years.
 

 

 

 
The heavens, earth, sun, and moon were all at her disposal.
 

 

 

 
This is bad.
 

 

 

 
Both the male lead and Jiang Dang thought to themselves.
 

 

 

 
It seems like he's fallen in love with her again.
# Chapter131
The final battle was the most intense scene for the entire crew to film.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had arranged the counterattack mechanism for the male lead.
 

 
The problem was, his opponent was Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was ‘Tong Zhao’, after all!
 

 
In a system that was well-developed and logically complete, her subconscious, even in the face of adversity, often found a way to survive. How could she be turned over in a situation where her side had such a strong advantage? Even someone as harsh as Shi Qianqiu had to arrange some powerful artifacts for the male lead, such as the divine sword ‘Twilight of the Gods’, and added one more setting...
 

 
The reason why the dark creatures increased in number and became so powerful when the red moon rose was because the Dark God had bestowed part of his divine power on his followers, creating a situation where they appeared strong on the outside but were weak on the inside.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu did everything he could to weaken Iya and strengthen the male lead.
 

 
Despite all the hidden operations, Shi Qianqiu still couldn't rest easy.
 

 
It would be easy to let Tong Zhao win.
 

 
But making her lose? That would be almost impossible.
 

 
The male lead's weapon was a sword that could fulfill every boy's fantasy, glowing with a faint light. The holy knight walked forward, his armor still shining white. And Iya? She jumped down from the red moon, her toes barely touching the water's surface. Was she going to summon a divine artifact out of thin air?
 

 
While the audience was pondering, Iya bent down, and her slender waist caught everyone's attention.
 

 
Including the male lead's.
 

 
With graceful movements, she reached into the water, grasping the reflection of the "Red Moon" on the surface. She pulled out the shadow of the moon from the sea, and a scarlet sickle, dripping with cold seawater, appeared in her hand. It looked like a death god harvesting the lives of everything.
 

 
"Shit! So that wasn't just a reflection?"
 

 
"No way! I need to buy the video and watch this closely. It was clearly a shadow!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was mesmerized.
 

 
He was a typical member of the movie audience—someone whose primary expectation was that the plot made sense. He came to watch the special effects, and he was easily captivated by imaginative and breathtaking visuals. It's easy to please him. As he excitedly watched the screen burning through the budget with impressive scenes, he wondered how the male lead would manage to turn the tables, given the huge gap in strength between the two sides.
 

 
Earlier in the story, it had been established that the male lead wasn't fighting alone. He had teammates from the capital, and they were splitting up to find a way to break the deadlock at the Dark God Temple in the Flowering Forest, while he sought out the core of the conflict on his own.
 

 
This was a very traditional commercial movie trope.
 

 
Unlike the antagonist, the protagonist is distinguished by their strong sense of teamwork. But when it comes to the critical moment, it’s the protagonist who must defeat the opponent personally, with teammates playing a supporting role. Shi Qianqiu was well-versed in this, and he never made a mistake with the pacing.
 

 
Before the "betrayal," Iya was quiet and always appeared serene and beautiful.
 

 
But after her "dark turn"...
 

 
"Since you have to have faith, why not believe in me?"
 

 
"True arrogance lies in making others repent. Why is the path you choose the right one, and mine wrong? The Dark God is the ultimate faith of the entire continent. The church created the dark creatures and sparked wars to seize power. Doesn’t that align perfectly with our teachings?"
 

 
The lavish special effects produced by Shi Qianqiu dazzled on the screen. The female lead, Iya, with her graceful yet imposing presence, managed to hold her own even in a scene dominated by explosive battle effects. In fact, it left the audience feeling overwhelmed, and those who purchased the immersive experience felt they definitely got their money's worth. They could strongly empathize with the male lead's intense admiration and internal struggle for her—this was an experience unique to holographic films! It was like the 3D experience of ‘Avatar’ back in the day. No bootleg could shake its box office dominance. Why? Because it was a movie you couldn’t experience at home; you had to go to the best Lam IMAX theater to fully appreciate the visual effects...
 

 
This gave the audience a compelling reason to go to the cinema.
 

 
With this kind of special experience, who would have trouble convincing the audience to open their wallets?
 

 
If you wanted to see such an explosive scene and the goddess portrayed by Tong Zhao, you had to go to the cinema!
 

 
Every critic who went to see this movie had to admit that Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu were the true power duo.
 

 
Imagine if another actress had been cast instead; she would have been overshadowed by Shi Qianqiu’s aesthetic dominance and relegated to a secondary role. Such dazzling special effects would steal the audience’s attention. Just like the actor who played the male lead, Sun Sa, despite his impressive performance and effort, he couldn’t help but fall into the background during this climactic moment, becoming a mere tool for the plot.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was different.
 

 
It is hard to explain in words, but in the holographic world, Tong Zhao was so naturally perfect for her role, it felt as if she was always meant to be a deity. She perfectly integrated into the character's setting, with the skills and effects of the heavens, earth, sun, and moon only serving as accessories to enhance her. The audience continued to focus on her, placing their attention on her no matter what.
 

 
As the audience and Dion were immersed in the grand scene, Iya spread her arms and cheerfully said:
 

 
"Try your best to please me."
 

 
...
 

 
The male lead didn't start out with the intention to kill. He tried to persuade Iya, telling her that the church's atrocities had been exposed and the king would not let them go. In fact, the capital was in chaos, the pope would not end up well, and as long as she stopped commanding the dark creatures to torment the people...
 

 
"From the moment I accepted the Dark God's inheritance, I was destined to commit evil. Asking me to stop is like asking a fish to leave the water, asking for no breath, or asking the sun to no longer rise in the east."
 

 
Iya smiled, her delicate face glowing with a divine golden halo as she stood against the light:
 

 
"The capital is in chaos, but what about those suffering saintesses? They were once stakes in a gamble, cannon fodder, playthings—did anyone care about them? The church has no innocent members, not even me. I couldn't save anyone from the hell the church built, but now I am the ruler of this hell, and it's my turn to set the rules."
 

 
The two of them fought for a long time.
 

 
But from the audience's perspective, everything happened very quickly.
 

 
The entire Garan continent followed Diya's wishes. When the Red Moon descended, the dark creatures fiercely invaded the capital, causing countless casualties. The once-protective temples became primary targets for attacks. Everyone knew that the church had been intentionally summoning dark creatures all along, even transforming discarded saintesses into dark creatures using secret rituals. Now, however, things had backfired—this creation had turned on them.
 

 
The God of Light did not respond to the prayers of its followers.
 

 
From the perspective of ordinary people, it seemed that the Dark God wasn’t as “greedy” as they thought. After all, wasn't it the church that liked to keep summoning? The artificial Red Moon descending? If you enjoy playing so much, fine, I’m here now—let’s see if you can handle it.
 

 
No one could handle it.
 

 
The people's complaints boiled over as the once-sacred capital temple was shattered into pieces, and there was hope that someone would come forward to clean up the mess.
 

 
At this point, Shi Qianqiu used the camera to its fullest effect. Even the audience who chose the immersive viewing experience could still feel the world that the heroine, Iya, summoned, and from the perspective of a god, things appeared distant and detached. Human life seemed so small, almost negligible.
 

 
There is a difference between humans and gods. Dion could not be so high and mighty. He still felt pity and guilt for the loss of life.
 

 
The sound effects of the holographic filming were explosive, with the dialogue at the climax of the final battle resonating in every viewer’s ears.
 

 
—Iya said, "This is your weakness."
 

 
—Dion replied, "But it also makes me strong."
 

 
Without suspense, the protagonist emerged victorious.
 

 
The victor did not feel triumphant. He was momentarily confused, then showed a look of puzzlement. Everything had happened so quickly. His god-slaying deeds were somehow synchronized and displayed in the sky above the continent of Galan, and everyone witnessed his greatness. They believed he had resolved the incident. Although he did not attain godhood, he was elevated to the same level.
 

 
The two gods had departed, and the people still needed faith.
 

 
Thus, Dion, who had defeated the great villain, was revered as the new Pope.
 

 
The Red Moon ended early.
 

 
Everyone celebrated the Dark God’s defeat by the new Pope, and the old sins were cleansed. The king was deeply grateful to Dion.
 

 
No one noticed that the once bright, shining sword of the new Pope had become entwined with a streak of red, and the cheerful, smiling Dion had not shown a smile ever since.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s cinematic portrayal was always rich in detail, providing the audience with the pleasure of solving puzzles, yet never so obscure that only after the movie ended would they need to read reviews to understand it fully. If that happened, it would mean the director failed—while it’s good for the audience to find deeper meaning in reviews, if they can’t understand the movie without them, it means the director needs to improve in storytelling and cinematography.
 

 
The audience’s perspective revealed something.
 

 
Iya had intentionally let him off the hook, even creating a situation that pushed him to a high position.
 

 
The sins of the old church had to be erased, and she also had a grudge against the continent of Galan. She exposed all the truths that needed to be revealed, and dying by his hands was the best ending.
 

 
Dion had passed her test.
 

 
As Iya had observed, he embodied the most traditional knightly spirit—he was a person of noble character, both wise and brave.
 

 
...
 

 
"After watching the movie, all I want to say is, did you see the Time Sea in the final battle? That’s where Iya let the protagonist off the hook."
 

 
"No, those are just the tears that flowed from my eyes."
 

 
"Old thief Shi, die!!"
 

 
"The goddess I loved was fake, but let’s discuss rationally—did Iya really love Dion?"
 

 
...
 

 
Many who hadn’t bought the immersive experience due to its high price struggled for a while after removing their helmets, only to end up purchasing the expensive tickets.
 

 
And many core fans, who weren’t short on money and were still left wanting more, decided to watch it again.
 

 
When buying tickets for a second viewing, they suddenly realized...
 

 
They could actually choose to view the film from Iya’s perspective in the immersive experience?
 

 
Wait, they could even unlock hidden perspectives in the second round??
 

 
As the audience thought about it, they immediately understood everything.
 

 
If the first viewing was from Iya's perspective, there would be no "surprise" twist. Watching from Dion's perspective would provide the best experience, just like the first viewing.
 

 
Originally, the audience was already satisfied after watching it once, but now, with the new perspective from the female protagonist...
 

 
Four big words appeared in their minds:
 

 
"Tears for the second viewing."
 

 
Tong Zhao also went to watch it.
 

 
She went with her friends from Zeshan, and the rich young man from the group, Wei, booked the whole theater. The friends chatted freely without worrying about disturbing others.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao didn't join in the conversation.
 

 
She was busy interacting with her sister, the Saintess.
 

 
When the movie reached the part where the female protagonist was about to let Dion off the hook...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Ah, so this is the Iya sister who is pure evil and wants the world to end?]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Consort Chen: [No way, no way, no one would do good deeds under the flag of a villain, right? I could do better—I'd immediately gather three thousand male concubines to serve this goddess, and the continent of Galan would instantly become a female-dominant world.]
 

 
Iya: [......]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [How should I put this?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [The female bodhisattva is actually me?]
 

 
The Saintess sister was so angry that she crushed the eyeball embedded in the scepter's head with one hand.
 

 
Instinctive cinema reflects the truest subconscious.
 

 
Iya said she was absolutely evil.
 

 
Zhao Zai peeked out: [Is this being tsundere?]
 

 
...
 

 
The damage wasn’t great, but the insult was extremely strong.
# Chapter132
Inside the Palace of Consciousness:
 

 
Iya: "How much is the box office?"
 

 
Each persona has their own individual room, and Iya, who would normally shut herself in and ignore everyone, has been spending more time in the living room after ‘The Iya Myth’ was released, rarely returning to her room. Consort Chen, who loves to watch the drama, asked her: "Didn’t the Saintess say she doesn't care?"
 

 
Iya: "......"
 

 
Duan Ge: "She wants to know how many people saw her journey."
 

 
For the audience who purchased the immersive viewing experience and chose Iya's perspective, they can feel Iya’s every action, and the motivations behind them… Some anime fans can write thousands of words about a character's actions, just to analyze the character’s motivation. However, unless officially recognized, these analyses usually remain unconfirmed.
 

 
Person A thinks the protagonist eats because they’re hungry. Person B thinks the protagonist eats to start a conversation with another character.
 

 
Don't ask, just know they've shipped it.
 

 
Anyway, the official side usually doesn't comment.
 

 
In the case of ‘The Iya Myth’, the question is whether the villain intentionally let Dion win or if she truly couldn’t be beaten.
 

 
With immersive viewing, there’s no ambiguity. Every audience member can clearly feel that Iya knew the truth behind the Saintess selection and the two gods. From the very beginning of the film, she was determined to martyr herself—only by gaining the power to challenge the vast force of the Light Church could she walk a dangerous path, fully aware that the deeper her connection with the Dark God, the more her mind would be influenced.
 

 
By the latter half of the film, Iya was struggling against her own survival instincts, only thinking about how to die with meaning. Death was not something to fear.
 

 
Immersive viewing was incredibly engaging, but even with regular holographic viewing, the audience could still feel Iya's allure, moved to tears.
 

 
It was truly hard to come to terms with.
 

 
After watching the movie, fans couldn't help but wonder if there was a possibility of a happy ending—since Iya is so good and Dion loves her so much, why couldn't there be a "prince and princess live happily ever after" conclusion?
 

 
Good people deserve a good ending, which is what most of the audience feels.
 

 
Iya is a good person, with no flaws.
 

 
Dion is also a good kid.
 

 
So where's the problem?
 

 
After much thought, the audience finally reached a unified conclusion—
 

 
"The source of all evil, Shi Qianqiu—who supports and who opposes?"
 

 
[I declare that Shi Qianqiu is the real villain!]
 

 
[I declare your declaration is valid.]
 

 
[The Saintess Sister is not only kind-hearted, but also super kind, but Shi Qianqiu really has no heart!!!]
 

 
Recently, Tong Zhao has developed an unexpected love for browsing the internet and reading movie reviews.
 

 
Her agent was quite surprised, saying that she didn't realize she enjoyed reading praise about herself.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled: "Of course!"
 

 
Iya held her head: "Stop reading it..."
 

 
Consort Chen, with an opera-like tone, sweetly read out the reviews: "How could the Saintess Sister be absolutely evil? She's clearly too kind! Just thinking about how she was heading for martyrdom from the start makes me feel sorry for her. Iya is a little angel!"
 

 
The cute ending of the word ‘ba’ (a cute tone) was drawn out in an adorable loli voice.
 

 
Duan Ge had a hard time holding back his laughter.
 

 
Consort Chen really knows how to make people uncomfortable.
 

 
Elder Lu patted Iya on the shoulder, and everything was silently understood.
 

 
After Tong Zhao made slight adaptations to Iya's experiences and turned them into a script, almost all the critics felt that she wasn't a bad person. She was inherently kind, and her actions had never been wrong. The only bad thing was Shi Qianqiu, the director. When Consort Chen read the third review aloud, Iya couldn't take it anymore and retreated to her room.
 

 
Elder Lu: "Stop always bullying her."
 

 
Consort Chen: "When the disease is severe, you have to use strong medicine. The child spends all day fantasizing that she's the irredeemable villain—she's probably just craving compliments."
 

 
Tong Zhao could only laugh and say "hahaha."
 

 
The movie was titled ‘Iya Myth’, but for ordinary people and those in the entertainment industry who didn't understand the full story, this was just another box office success created by Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu. Wherever they went, they were living, breathing box office machines.
 

 
Thanks to ‘Iya Myth’'s excellent box office performance, its screenings in real-world theaters also increased significantly. In the era of immersive cinema, audiences with helmets or capsules could enjoy watching movies at home, but what they came to the theaters for was the interactive experience, especially those who purchased the "immersive viewing" experience.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ breaks another box office record on opening day, with a single-day peak reaching..."
 

 
"Box office slump reversed? Reviews exploded? Tong Zhao continues her undefeated legend."
 

 
"What's the secret to ‘Iya Myth’'s success? Could immersive viewing be the new wealth code?"
 

 
From the script's perspective, ‘Iya Myth’ wasn't a particularly complicated story.
 

 
If you're asking how deep it is, not really.
 

 
At least Shi Qianqiu never thought about winning the Best Script Award; he only submitted for Best Special Effects and Best Actress.
 

 
When he gave an interview, he straightforwardly said: "The script was written by Tong Zhao. She was interested in the story, so okay, I accompanied her to film it and helped her come up with ways to make the movie interesting and profitable. We didn’t aim to explore profound human nature; we just wanted to give the audience a unique fantasy journey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu's logic was always this simple and blunt.
 

 
He made movies boldly, but his ideas were very practical. His goal was to serve the audience, to create blockbuster films that everyone would love to watch and that could make money. This director, who was the least short on funds in the industry, was often the one who earned the most. One could only sigh and think, "The rich get richer."
 

 
As the audience's positive impression of him increased due to this approach, Shi Qianqiu added a piece of behind-the-scenes information: "The red smoke on the holy sword of Dion is actually the shattered soul of Iya. Why is it shattered? Haha, because the male lead killed her with his own hands."
 

 
The host paused for a moment.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu continued: "Hey, fans, don’t cry. Let me give you some candy. They loved each other, they liked each other."
 

 
He looked into the camera, his tone sincere.
 

 
Immediately, the screen was filled with a barrage of question marks.
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Just when I started to like him a little…]
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu, are you even human?! I feel like he's stuffing a knife into my mouth while asking, "Isn't this candy sweet? How sweet is it?" But all I taste is rust...]
 

 
All the hatred was redirected to the director.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao, the audience's affection for Iya's character was transferred to her.
 

 
To the audience, Tong Zhao was the Saintess herself.
 

 
If she didn’t have such a gentle and kind subconscious, could she have portrayed such a great character? No, she couldn’t have. Netizens believed this too, thinking she was especially good.
 

 
This made Tong Zhao feel a little embarrassed.
 

 
Thanks to its strong box office performance, the movie stayed in theaters for a long time before it finally ended its run.
 

 
Fans counted on their fingers, knowing that the awards season was coming. Even if they didn’t win an award, getting a nomination would be great.
# Chapter133
Upon arriving at the neighboring city, it was 2 p.m.
 

 
Tong Zhao always tried to keep her travels as low-key as possible. She didn’t need to show off her popularity by having fans brave the cold wind to pick her up. In fact, she would be bothered by it. Out of consideration for not making things harder for security, she would try her best not to acknowledge the fans on-site, walking quickly and expressionlessly under the escort of security.
 

 
After all, if the fans got too excited and were pushed around, it would be the security personnel who would be in discomfort.
 

 
But thinking about how the fans had come all the way there only to be ignored also made Tong Zhao feel bad.
 

 
The best outcome would be if no one came to pick her up.
 

 
With Tong Zhao’s insistence, the team was strict about security, and occasionally, paparazzi would snap pictures of her not being picked up by any fans at the airport. Fans felt deeply sorry for her, thinking she was being neglected in her own city. But in reality, she was quite happy about it. However, even when explained, some younger fans refused to believe it.
 

 
They insisted it was the company’s fault, that she couldn’t speak out about the truth.
 

 
When their sister said not to let them, would they really just comply?
 

 
Do they still love their sister?
 

 
Faced with such devotion, Tong Zhao could only try her best to do her job well.
 

 
“I wonder if any fans are here to pick me up…”
 

 
“You don’t need to think about it. Of course there are,” her round-faced assistant shattered her little illusion. “Xiao Zhao, the news about your nomination for the Huaying Awards is everywhere. This is such a clear schedule, it’s so easy for fans to catch you. Don’t underestimate them!”
 

 
Tong Zhao would never underestimate her fans.
 

 
Since her popularity had skyrocketed, in addition to the fans who simply admired her, there were also paparazzi and related people who came looking for profit.
 

 
Her schedule, her privacy, her photos—all of it could be sold for a high price…
 

 
As the team chatted easily, they disembarked, and sure enough, Tong Zhao could already see a sea of people waiting from afar.
 

 
She was suddenly moved: "Iya, your turn."
 

 
Iya: "Why? I'm not interested..."
 

 
Before she could finish, she was pushed into action.
 

 
After all, the main personality still had more authority.
 

 
Although when asked, Iya would usually respond with a question: "Why should I help?" However, when the responsibility was put on her, she would still stiffen her face and get it done.
 

 
Some keen-eyed people, upon seeing the target through the VIP channel, quickly turned their faces toward her. Every one of their eyes sparkled with excitement and expectation, looking at Iya with longing and admiration. Due to the airport's order, the fans didn’t dare to make too much noise; they could only express their love by holding up banners and signs—
 

 
“Zhao Zai, Mommy loves you!”
 

 
“Tong Zhao’s Showstopper!”
 

 
“Protect the world’s best little angel Iya!”
 

 
...
 

 
When Iya saw the third banner, her face darkened, and she averted her gaze.
 

 
The countless flashes from cameras formed a shimmering fog of light around her, making her already beautiful face look almost distorted in the halo of attention.
 

 
Her assistant had once joked that she had a divine aura.
 

 
Wasn't that true? She already had the aura of a goddess on her way out.
 

 
Finally, they spotted Tong Zhao! The fans were trying to contain their excitement, their faces flushed with joy. They whispered to their companions, sharing their impressions of seeing the star in person—“She looks a bit thinner than in the photos. Her long hair is like a cloud. She walks through the airport’s VIP channel like she’s stepping onto a red carpet, distant and natural.”
 

 
If she were an ordinary small celebrity, some fans might feel disappointed and think she was being too pretentious.
 

 
But this is Tong Zhao!
 

 
Just think about the news reports and the well-known box office achievements, Tong Zhao has the capital to be proud.
 

 
In fact, many fans actually love this superstar vibe she gives off.
 

 
Some enthusiastic, wealthy, and idle fans who have seen her in person many times lamented, “Zhao Zhao looks a little different today. She’s usually quite friendly with fans, and smiles at us. But today, she’s not smiling. However, she looks like...”
 

 
“Looks like what?”
 

 
“Is she a bit shy?”
 

 
Iya, with her keen hearing, couldn't help but cast a warning glance when she overheard this.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes, with a light hue, were misty with a subtle, entrancing look.
 

 
It was enough to steal one's soul at a glance.
 

 
The fan, who had been speaking casually, let out a short, sharp scream, electrified and speechless, overwhelmed with affection for "Sister," bending like a mosquito coil. Iya's moment of hesitation quickly disappeared, and she returned her gaze, adopting the attitude of ignoring these foolish mortals with cool detachment.
 

 
Iya heard very clearly.
 

 
Many people were saying they liked her.
 

 
...
 

 
"Hey, look, doesn't Tong Zhao's ears look a bit red?"
 

 
"Even though she didn’t say anything, I know she's still happy to see us!"
 

 
"The shy sister is just too cute!!!”
 

 
Once the fans noticed this, they got even more excited. Many airport photos were leaked, and even though the retouched ones hadn't been released yet, raw photos were already circulating with each person having their own copy. Her face was too stunning—there were no flaws. No matter how bad their photography skills were, they couldn’t go wrong—every random shot turned out beautiful. What's more, since Tong Zhao debuted, there has never been a truly unflattering photo of her. Even when people who dislike her try to spread hate, they can only post photos of her with a cold, aloof expression, accusing her of being pretentious and arrogant.
 

 
Despite the fans’ enthusiasm, "Tong Zhao" quickly jumped into the chauffeur-driven car and disappeared from view…
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao fasten her seatbelt, the assistant closed their eyes, assuming she hadn’t rested well on the plane and didn’t want to disturb her. Iya took her place, retreating to her room to be alone.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, regaining control of her body.
 

 
Ever since she exposed Iya’s "tsundere" persona, Iya had grown more self-destructive about maintaining that image.
 

 
...
 

 
The Huaying Awards were live-streamed across the internet.
 

 
Tong Zhao came with the crew of ‘Iya Myth’. Sun Sa had already emerged from his gloomy period—he was lucky, having joined the fast track with Shi and Tong early on, and throughout filming, he received shock therapy from the seasoned director, Shi Laoze. He had shed his college boy innocence and had grown into a mature man who could stand beside Tong Zhao, not necessarily a perfect match, but at least a man worthy of being her partner for a day.
 

 
The moment they stepped out of the car, they were engulfed by a sea of flashing cameras.
 

 
Sun Sa, who had been warned in advance, maintained his composure, though his stiff expression looked slightly forced.
 

 
Beside him, Tong Zhao exuded the aura of the Empress, outshining the entire scene. Despite the blinding lights, she maintained a composed smile. Her beauty was flawless, standing up to any angle. To meet the expectations of the fans, she wore a platinum-colored gown today, echoing the look of her nominated character, Iya.
 

 
Under the influence of her aura, Tong Zhao walked in real life with the effect of a movie scene. All the viewers watching the live broadcast and the fans on-site couldn’t help but hold their breath. Some fans couldn’t control themselves and shouted her name, hoping to catch her attention.
 

 
[Wow, she’s so beautiful, it’s like she’s glowing.]
 

 
[Maybe it's her accumulated box office that's glowing /manual dog head.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, I really want to see the scene live! Does she have a good chance of winning?]
 

 
The comments were buzzing with excitement.
 

 
The plot of ‘Iya Myth’ wasn’t particularly profound or complex, and it didn’t delve into social issues. The film had a high chance of winning a visual effects award, and Shi Qianqiu was almost certain to win. However, Best Actress was less certain.
 

 
Since the era of immersive cinema has nothing to do with acting skills, the standard for evaluating actors had become the degree of their standout moments.
 

 
Among this year’s nominees, there wasn’t a clear standout champion; the contenders were evenly matched, and many felt that the Huaying Awards judges should take box office performance into account. ‘Iya Myth’ had phenomenal box office results, and its support for immersive cinema was also a big plus.
 

 
Of course, this was a discussion for those particularly interested in the awards.
 

 
The remaining netizens were discussing more intuitive topics—
 

 
On various discussion forums, countless threads featuring "Tong Zhao" surged. [She and Sun Sa are really a perfect match], [Actually, I think Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu walking the red carpet together would be even better. Sun Sa is a bit weak], [What do you know? A wolfdog with a queen will always be a legend], and [Her dress is so beautiful! It suits her so well, she’s basically a modern-day Iya. I want to buy one just like it…]
 

 
Then the price of the dress posted online made everyone fall silent.
 

 
This gown was a high-end custom piece from a blue-blood brand. Sister Chu didn’t have the connections to get it, but Zeshan and the others knew that Tong Zhao had a great chance of winning and possibly earning her first Best Actress title. They all chipped in to help, with Wei Zekai coordinating everything. Actually, he could afford it alone; compared to the cost of a yacht, it was nothing, but the true value lay in the heartfelt gesture from her good friends.
 

 
The platinum-colored gown was adorned with diamonds, truly luxurious and sparkling, like a goddess draped in stars.
 

 
After a brief interview, the Huaying Awards ceremony officially began. The cameras were fairly distributed, and even Tong Zhao, who was the most popular on-site, couldn’t stay in the spotlight the entire time. However, sharp-eyed viewers quickly noticed that she was sitting between Shi Qianqiu and Sun Sa, which pleased fans supporting both pairings.
 

 
Sitting together, it was almost like they were already "officially registered."
 

 
The ceremony was lengthy, and being a guest at the event was no easy task. Wearing haute couture, one couldn’t afford to relax; you never knew when the camera might be on you. You had to remain focused on watching, and playing on your phone was out of the question...
 

 
However, Tong Zhao had her own way to pass the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "You're really playing your cards well."
 

 
Consoy Chen: "I see two kings, I call it the landlord. That’s called dominance."
 

 
Han Zhi: "Is that why you asked the system to block the synchronization of memory between different personalities?"
 

 
Duan Ge: "A little gambling is just for fun."
 

 
Zhao Zai had been bouncing around at the card table for a while.
 

 
She originally wanted to play too, but then she was scooped up by Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t bored, but the people around her were.
 

 
This was Sun Sa’s first time attending such a grand event, and he was nervous, his mind full of thoughts about how he didn’t deserve to be there. How did he go from his dilapidated dormitory at school to the Huaying Awards ceremony? His film had a good chance of winning, though not Best Picture, but it was still stirring.
 

 
As for Shi Qianqiu, he was already tired of this kind of event.
 

 
If it weren’t for the nomination, he wouldn’t have wanted to sit through hours of it.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu glanced at Tong Zhao, who was smiling and lost in thought, and spoke to her, “Are you nervous? You’re about to win your first Best Actress award.”
 

 
“I can only be considered a strong contender,” Tong Zhao replied, both candid and restrained.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stared at the stage and softly said, “Best Picture is impossible because the script is too limited, so the team is mainly focusing on Best Actress. In a few hours, you’ll be the Best Actress. Are you surprised? Excited?”
 

 
---
 

 
Tong Zhao also asked softly, “Are you the type who, when someone gets a mystery novel, immediately leans over and says, ‘The murderer is so-and-so’?”
 

 
“Otherwise, you think my brother stopped reading mystery novels for what reason?”
 

 
Life of being spoiled by spoilers.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of sympathy for this brother she had never met.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: “So, are you excited or not?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Not excited.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu shot her a glance, and indeed, her small face remained calm.
 

 
Tong Zhao reflected for a moment. The first time she quick-travelled, when she became a noble concubine, ascended to immortality, when Han Zhi kept winning awards, and when she inherited the legacy of the Dark God... it seemed like she had gotten used to being excited, and over time, it became more and more mundane. What truly made her smile joyfully were the little details in daily life.
 

 
A camera captured Tong Zhao and Shi Qianqiu speaking softly to each other, and the audience thought they were probably discussing the award ceremony. Although Shi Qianqiu's words could be harsh, his analysis of films was often sharp and insightful. He also had a prophetic understanding of the film market. Many viewers who found the award ceremony boring were eager to hear what he and Tong Zhao were talking about, believing it was probably more interesting than the ceremony itself.
 

 
In reality...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "As if nothing happened."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "It’s all about effort."
 

 
"Haha," Shi Qianqiu paused. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao tried hard to resist the urge to roll her eyes at him. "Do whatever you want."
 

 
---
 

 
Three minutes later, the two were still caught in a never-ending loop of wordplay over the idiom "do whatever you want.”
# Chapter134: The End of the Main Text
"First Defeat for Tong Zhao!"
 

 
A huge snow-white banner appeared out of nowhere in the consciousness palace, hanging in the middle of the living room.
 

 
What was the "first defeat"?
 

 
It was in the idiom game with Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Rewind the time by one minute—
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly sighed, "Isn’t that enough? I can’t take it anymore!"
 

 
Upon hearing this, Shi Qianqiu turned his head, a faint smile appearing on his clean, scholar-like face. "Can’t take it anymore?"
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow.
 

 
If this were a game, her question mark would already be on the screen.
 

 
The smile in Shi Qianqiu’s eyes deepened. "Do as you wish, can’t take it anymore."
 

 
...
 

 
Another cycle. How many more times?
 

 
Tong Zhao sneered, holding back the urge to curse at him—what if the camera caught her lip movements, and she couldn’t explain it? She decided to stay silent and let him embarrass himself. However, for Shi Qianqiu, embarrassment? Not possible. His skin was as thick as layers of cement. When the camera swept to their side, he still calmly smiled at it, causing a stir in the bullet screen.
 

 
[Shi Qianqiu is considered one of the better-looking directors.]
 

 
[Actually, he’s pretty good-looking even among male stars…]
 

 
[Don’t talk about it, just thinking about dating him makes me lose interest immediately.]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu had been in relationships before; his ex-girlfriend was a well-known international model.
 

 
However, his sharp remarks left such a strong impression on netizens that it’s hard to imagine him being involved in a sweet romance—his ex-girlfriend also had a world-weary, high-class look that seemed to scorn everything. When they stood together, they didn’t even need to speak to give off an air of mockery. Despite his handsome appearance, he surprisingly had very few female fans.
 

 
Soon, it was time for the highlight of tonight’s Instinct Film Awards—
 

 
The Best Actress award.
 

 
"In the film, they are the absolute main characters, and tonight, they are also the shining stars of the Huaying Awards. These five ladies are..." The presenter paused, smiling as they announced the first nominee: "Yan Yanghan, ‘The Pisces Incident’."
 

 
As the presenter called out the names, the big screen showed the nominees’ live appearances and stills from their films.
 

 
Tong Zhao was placed last on the list.
 

 
When Tong Zhao appeared on the screen, the audience only saw her nodding slightly at the camera, her cold and elegant expression betraying no hint of nervousness or expectation—true to her usual demeanor at major events. Even her most devoted fans would struggle to recall a time when she seemed nervous, even when she was just starting out. Every time she appeared, her outfit was impeccable, and her attitude graceful and composed.
 

 
"And the Best Actress award goes to—"
 

 
Amidst the heated discussions in the bullet screen, the presenter beamed an excited, sincere smile and called out towards Tong Zhao: "Tong Zhao, ‘Iya Myth!"
 

 
The scene erupted in cheers and applause, giving her a grand reception.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s popularity in the industry wasn’t particularly good or bad. Although she didn’t focus much on networking, her outstanding professional skills had earned her much goodwill. In a high-pressure work environment, a colleague who does their job well and doesn’t cause trouble is naturally treated with kindness. As for her competitors? While other actresses of the same generation may have harbored some resentment towards her, they had to admit that there was no real competition between them anymore.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao's box office success, even though they had to lower their status and invest their own money, the investors would naturally favor this money-making machine.
 

 
What does it feel like for Tong Zhao to be surrounded by applause as she steps onto the stage?
 

 
Consort Chen: "Keep the spotlight on me!"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Got it, got it."
 

 
Winning her first Best Actress award felt like a coronation.
 

 
Consort Chen was highly sensitive to such occasions, and she could not afford to make any mistakes. She had to shine brighter than anyone else.
 

 
With the spotlight on her, Tong Zhao walked briskly to the award stage. The lights fell on her, and she was, as expected, the center of attention—though, even without this "golden finger" of a spotlight, she was already stunning under the glow. But with the added radiance, her mortal beauty transformed into something otherworldly, dazzling and captivating, evoking admiration from all.
 

 
[Wow, she's just so beautiful!]
 

 
[She’s been in the industry for so long, and I've probably seen her face a thousand times, but how does she still manage to look even more beautiful each time?]
 

 
[Her dress is glowing—oh my god, it’s diamond-studded—so beautiful, truly well-deserved!]
 

 
[Not going up to accept the award would be an insult to her look.]
 

 
After briefly shaking hands with the presenter, they exchanged a few words of congratulations and pleasantries before handing her the stage to deliver her acceptance speech. Tong Zhao took the Huaying Award trophy from the presenter. It was heavier than she had imagined. Turning to face the concerned faces in the crowd—
 

 
The stage below was full of stars.
 

 
But at this moment, she was the true star of the show.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath.
 

 
In reality, she wasn’t particularly interested in winning the award; she was more focused on the PR capital it brought. She even thought about letting another personality take over and handle it. But even Consort Chen, who loved being in the spotlight, insisted that Tong Zhao take the stage herself. Consort Chen had said at the time: "You might not care now, or you might never care, but this is an important moment in your life, and it can only be claimed by the most complete version of you."
 

 
So, it would be her who took it.
 

 
“I remember not too long ago, I was just a girl who was kicked out of her home and cut off from financial support. ‘Ming Emperor’ was my first—and possibly my last—chance.”
 

 
The PR team had already written her acceptance speech, but when the words reached her lips, she spoke another version.
 

 
The fans on the barrage stopped complimenting her looks, turned off their comments, and chose to silently enjoy this special moment with their idol.
 

 
Tong Zhao had once missed this opportunity.
 

 
To be exact, she had cheated. She had come back from many worlds, honing her skills by conquering them.
 

 
A wave of emotion surged within her, unrelated to the honor of being named Best Actress.
 

 
Maybe it wasn’t about conquering.
 

 
She had come back to save herself.
 

 
“Critics often say I’m difficult to figure out, that they don’t know how to define me. And I often wonder, why should I be defined? I have a diverse subconscious; I don’t want to be fixed in one place. Even if Consort Chen brings me the first Best Actress award, I won’t always use her image in the future.”
 

 
Others didn’t know that she had many personalities; they thought it was just a narrative style.
 

 
Some loved the fierce and cool Duan Ge.
 

 
Some loved the aloof and solitary Lu Xianchang.
 

 
Some love the enchanting Consort Chen...
 

 
At this important moment, Tong Zhao only wanted to confess to herself.
 

 
"’Iya Myth’ was a bold challenge for both me and Shi Qianqiu. I asked him: Iya isn’t a traditionally positive character. She has twisted and obsessive traits, both toward others and herself. The box office might not be so optimistic."
 

 
"Director Shi told me: 'It’s okay, you focus on making the audience like her, and I’ll make the audience like the movie.'"
 

 
"I want to thank Director Shi, thank Sun Sa, thank all the staff behind and in front of ‘Iya Myth’, my agent, and every friend from Zeshan. They gave ‘Iya’ a lot of financial support..."
 

 
The consciousness palace was very quiet.
 

 
There were many difficulties walking this path in the human world. Tong Zhao was always strict with herself, always wanting to do better, always striving for perfection. The admiration from her fans and the recognition of the box office made her very satisfied and happy, but at this moment, all she wanted was her own recognition.
 

 
She didn’t need to ask; she already knew her answer.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised the trophy, showing the reporters an impeccable winning smile, and softly said in her heart:
 

 
*Thank you all.*
 

 
The applause was thunderous.

TN: The main text is over, there are still 8 extra chapters.
# Chapter135: Extras on Love (1) – Shi Qianqiu I Married Tong Zhao...
The night had fallen.
 

 
At the after-party for the Huaying Awards, Tong Zhao was still surrounded by a crowd. Though she maintained a polite social distance, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the circle of people around her was made up of several layers, given the typically reserved and dignified nature of these celebrities. Photographers moved through the crowd, and the flashes of cameras occasionally landed on her expensive dress, making it sparkle and shine.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu stood beside her, gallantly blocking drinks for her.
 

 
Given Tong Zhao’s status, she was never the type of person to be toyed with by the powerful and wealthy. Therefore, the toasts were mostly short and polite, not meant to make her uncomfortable or embarrass her. However, after a while, she remained curious: "I didn’t expect you to have such a good tolerance for alcohol."
 

 
"Drinking is part of the fun," Shi Qianqiu turned his face toward her, flashing a smile. "Anything that’s fun, I’m good at."
 

 
Beneath his refined and cultured appearance was a deep, unfathomable darkness, which made Tong Zhao feel a little uneasy. She turned to Sun Sa and said, "You asked me how I’ve managed to stay true to myself in the entertainment industry before? Just don’t follow his example."
 

 
"Don’t falsely accuse me. I’ve been like this since elementary school—this is what staying true to oneself really looks like."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s words were soft, but it seemed like he sensed something. The smile on his lips deepened, and he gestured to a photographer in the distance. "Come take a photo, maybe give the ‘Shi-Zhao CP’ fans some perks?"
 

 
Tong Zhao found this a little strange.
 

 
Although Shi Qianqiu didn’t care much about how others tried to pair him with people for the sake of fanfiction, apart from the last promotional event, he generally didn’t use this kind of thing to hype up his popularity—he found it beneath him.
 

 
What kind of wind was this?
 

 
However, when the photographer smiled and walked over, Tong Zhao still allowed the gesture, as she felt she should give her friend face. Shi Qianqiu casually wrapped his arm around her waist—not actually holding her, just making a show of their close relationship.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled as she flashed a smile at the photographer.
 

 
With a flash of light, the photographer complimented her:
 

 
"Xiao Zhao, you look really beautiful tonight!"
 

 
"The stylist put a lot of effort into it," Tong Zhao said modestly, her expression calm.
 

 
"Your hair is messy."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised his hand and tucked the stray hairs at her temples behind her ear.
 

 
To the onlookers, the two of them seemed incredibly close, their interaction so subtle that it was almost imperceptible.
 

 
As for the feelings of the parties involved… it was rather unsettling.
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao was pondering why Shi Qianqiu was being so considerate for no apparent reason, the "truth" walked over with a cold face:
 

 
"Tong Zhao, congratulations."
 

 
Wei Zekai had arrived midway through.
 

 
As the main person in charge of Zeshan, his job was just as demanding as Tong Zhao's. He often had to fly around for business trips, and with his father expecting him to inherit the family business, he was always under pressure. He had been delayed by a major business deal and had hurried to the Huaying party…
 

 
But he didn’t really have to rush.
 

 
He could meet Tong Zhao anytime.
 

 
Even if they couldn’t meet in person, he could always get her to answer a video call.
 

 
But after hearing that Tong Zhao had a good chance of winning, Wei Zekai decided to come in person. He was still in the car when the award ceremony was taking place, anxious to get there, and when he finally arrived, he saw the intimate scene between the two from a distance.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mood completely broke down at that moment.
 

 
For the past few days, Wei Zekai had been thinking about his feelings for Tong Zhao.
 

 
He hadn’t figured it out.
 

 
Or maybe he didn’t want to figure it out, fearing that if he did, they might not even be friends anymore.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her head toward Wei Zekai when she heard him speak, and Shi Qianqiu also lifted his gaze to look at him, flashing a provocative smile. Just as Tong Zhao happened to glance back at Shi Qianqiu, Director Shi immediately concealed his challenging expression and put on a refined, gentlemanly demeanor once again.
 

 
All of this was seen clearly by Wei Zekai—he understood it completely—
 

 
This guy really is no good!
 

 
"You’re here," Tong Zhao said, now understanding what Shi Qianqiu’s earlier actions had been about. She couldn’t help but laugh a little. She knew how busy Xiao Kai was, and he had actually managed to make it to the venue. She immediately gave him the second most sincere smile of the night: "You rushed here right after getting off the plane?"
 

 
"I changed clothes."
 

 
It was too rushed. Wei Zekai hadn’t had time to style himself carefully, but his looks were still good enough to carry him through. He wasn’t any less handsome than Sun Sa. Plus, his experience in the business world had given him a more mature aura. He had the vigor of youth, but also the depth of a mature man. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, slightly furrowing his brow. The photographer, who had been about to leave, was delighted to see Wei Zekai and immediately turned back to take another picture.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "I’ll be in it too."
 

 
The photographer, of course, didn’t mind.
 

 
With a flash of the camera, the three of them had a group photo.
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious but kept his temper in check. Shi Qianqiu noticed that he was jealous and said to the photographer, "Make sure to send me a copy of the photo. It’s so meaningful."
 

 
After the photographer agreed and walked away, Wei Zekai couldn’t help but feel annoyed.
 

 
Meaningful? What a load of nonsense!
 

 
It should have been just him and Tong Zhao in the photo, not him being dragged into it.
 

 
The three of them walked to a quieter corner to talk. Tong Zhao asked him, "Meaningful?”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu gestured and said, "That group photo—doesn’t it look like the Chinese character 'niao’ (meaning annoyed or angry)? The meaning fits perfectly!"
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was from Guangdong, and Tong Zhao knew a little Cantonese. In Cantonese, "niao" means "angry," so he was making a pun at Wei Zekai's expense. Wei Zekai didn’t understand, but from the way Shi Qianqiu was talking, it was clear he wasn’t saying anything nice.
 

 
But then, to Tong Zhao’s surprise…
 

 
She seemed to enjoy it!
 

 
Wei Zekai had used Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) before and didn’t understand why some people complained that their partners didn’t notice the "green tea". He couldn’t understand what was so infuriating about it. Now, he completely got it. Shi Qianqiu knew how to use every chance to make Tong Zhao laugh or give him provocative looks whenever she wasn’t looking directly at him. And whenever she noticed, he would immediately switch to looking perfectly composed and self-assured, making Wei Zekai angry but unable to expose it.
 

 
So manipulative!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, the master of "green tea"!
 

 
Just then, someone came up to Tong Zhao to invite her for a group photo. She said, "I’ll be back in a moment."
 

 
That left the two men staring at each other.
 

 
This should have been an awkward scene, but Shi Qianqiu wasn’t bothered. He casually took a sip of champagne, completely at ease.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "The movie we worked on together won her her first Best Actress award."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re childhood sweethearts."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "We’re business partners in Zeshan."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: "Best Actress..." He dragged out the "s" at the end.
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t get it. He glanced at Shi Qianqiu, who explained, "Best Actress ‘s’, the plural form. Don’t you know English? I can bring her many Best Actress awards in the future."
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai was furious!
 

 
Shi Qianqiu thought to himself, no wonder Tong Zhao was so tolerant of him—teasing him was just too fun. He was a lot like his younger brother, though his brother was a bit more obedient and serious. Watching Wei Zekai getting so worked up, unable to come up with a response, was quite amusing. He was curious to see what kind of big move Wei Zekai would come up with.
 

 
After a while, he heard Wei Zekai say:
 

 
"If you're not good to her, I won't let you off the hook."
 

 
...
 

 
Shi Qianqiu raised an eyebrow, genuinely surprised.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew the two had a close relationship. Given their intimate interaction just now and the subtle aura of a "main wife" Shi Qianqiu was giving off, he had completely misunderstood. Although he didn't think Shi Qianqiu was a good person, as long as Tong Zhao liked him, he trusted her judgment and choices. Even though it felt like his heart was being squeezed, he didn’t try to deny their relationship.
 

 
The light fell on his proud brows and eyes, looking both dejected and defiant—his youthful energy practically radiating from him.
 

 
What is youthful energy, if not loving someone you can't have?
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found himself momentarily lost in thought, watching him.
 

 
Wei Zekai thought Shi Qianqiu was silent because he didn’t believe him, so he continued, “Tong Zhao might seem strong, but she hasn’t gone through much hardship. She's actually very delicate. You can’t just assume that because she’s independent, you don’t need to pamper her.” He went on to talk about her picky eating habits, her gaming preferences, and what gifts she liked to receive…
 

 
Forced to listen to his partner’s unsolicited advice, Shi Qianqiu snapped back to reality and said, “Alright, when Tong Zhao and I get married, remember to come be my best man.”
 

 
A huge question mark appeared over Wei Zekai’s head.
 

 
“You’re going too far!”
 

 
“Aren’t you good friends? Is it too much to ask you to be my best man?” Shi Qianqiu asked knowingly.
 

 
This left Wei Zekai speechless.
 

 
Yes, what’s the big deal?
 

 
Wei Zekai lowered his gaze slightly, his thoughts slowly becoming clearer.
 

 
But it was too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu found his expression so amusing. He had heard that Wei Zekai and his younger brother were good friends, so why didn’t his younger brother invite him over earlier? Ah, it was a case of "better late than never."
 

 
He swirled his wine glass and, with a tone full of feigned sentimentality, said, "Don’t worry, I’ll treat her well."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu’s acting skills were truly impressive.
 

 
Wei Zekai believed him, feeling both relieved and heartbroken.
 

 
What reassured him was that Shi Qianqiu didn’t seem to be playing with Tong Zhao, that he wasn’t toying with her emotions. What saddened him was that he always felt he could treat Tong Zhao better, but he had arrived too late…
 

 
No, it wasn’t that he was late.
 

 
It was that he realized it a bit too late.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu asked, “Aren’t you unwilling to accept this?”
 

 
“A bit,” Wei Zekai muttered. “It’s not your fault. I always thought I had more time with her. I didn’t want to change the status quo. I was afraid that if I changed anything, I might lose her.”
 

 
Familiarity, in love, isn’t always a good thing.
 

 
Although he didn’t fully understand their story, someone as perceptive as Shi Qianqiu had probably figured out most of it from his few words…
 

 
A warm smile curved on the corner of his lips.
 

 
“It’s okay, I’ll treat her well on your behalf.”
 

 
...
 

 
When Tong Zhao returned, she saw Wei Zekai looking all gloomy and Shi Qianqiu looking particularly pleased.
 

 
She wasn’t sure what had happened, but it was probably something to do with being bullied.
 

 
Tong Zhao sighed, “Don’t bully him.”
 

 
This sweet interaction…
 

 
Wei Zekai felt even more heartbroken hearing that.
 

 
“I didn’t bully him,” Shi Qianqiu replied. “I just think he has a rare youthful energy. I want to invite him to act in my next movie.”
 

 
Shi Qianqiu was speaking the truth. In the entertainment industry, it was rare to find someone as handsome, with such a noble and youthful aura: “I’m going to take another walk. You two talk. Oh, and by the way, remember to come to my wedding.”
 

 
Wei Zekai almost wanted to curse.
 

 
He glanced at Tong Zhao and held back.
 

 
Tong Zhao was puzzled. “He’s getting married?”
 

 
She hadn’t heard that he had a girlfriend.
 

 
Since they’d met, Shi Qianqiu had always been single, and she wasn’t that familiar with Wei Zekai either. So, she couldn’t help but be curious. “Are you going to his wedding? Who is he marrying?”
 

 
As soon as she asked, she saw the look of disbelief on Wei Zekai’s face as he stared at her.
 

 
That look in his eyes was like a little dog that had just been kicked by its owner, utterly stunned.
# Chapter136: Emotional Extra (2) You Need to Wake Up Before I Can Have My Say...
Wei Zekai didn’t want to talk to her and started sulking.
 

 
They were so familiar with each other, like in a game—one signal, and Tong Zhao would know exactly what he meant. It was the same this time. As the party was nearing its end, they had long passed the stage where minor conflicts needed to be addressed on the spot. Tong Zhao decided to wait until they were heading home before discussing it.
 

 
After the party ended, Wei Zekai took a detour and had his driver take a cab back. He shamelessly parked next to Tong Zhao’s chauffeur-driven car, standing there silently.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing. "Let’s send them back. I’ll ride with Xiao Kai."
 

 
Her team members, tight-lipped and not ones to ask many questions, had their curiosity piqued, their eyes lighting up with gossip. Tong Zhao didn’t explain much and climbed into Wei Zekai’s car. Most likely, knowing she’d need a ride home, he didn’t have the driver bring out his flashy sports car today. Instead, he chose a low-key, comfortable business car—sports cars, with their focus on speed and appearance, often sacrificed passenger comfort.
 

 
The car was very quiet.
 

 
The car’s air freshener gave off a faint lemon scent, fresh but not overpowering.
 

 
Tong Zhao changed out of her off-shoulder dress, removed her heavy makeup, and applied just a light touch of powder. She looked even younger than when she dazzled on stage. Wei Zekai glanced at her. At first glance, she seemed no different from when they were in school.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was a pampered little princess who had never experienced the harsh realities of the world, but she was well-mannered…
 

 
She was the best girl Wei Zekai had ever known.
 

 
The car stopped at a red light. It began to rain lightly outside, and the raindrops blurred the streetlights that fell on her face, casting a shadow of freckles across her nose.
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke softly, "Zekai..."
 

 
Wei Zekai spoke first, "Are you really going to marry Shi Qianqiu?"
 

 
...
 

 
The bride is me!?
 

 
Tong Zhao had thought of many ridiculous answers, but she never imagined it would land on her. Her face showed a look of confusion.
 

 
Seeing that she didn't respond, Wei Zekai felt a bitterness in his heart—he had just thought Shí Qiānqiū was a master of tea arts, but the true "green tea" was actually him. Shi Qianqiu was Tong Zhao’s real boyfriend. The words hit his heart like a hammer, bitter like lotus seed paste. If this were happening to Shi Qianqiu or Jiang Dang, they would have acted the moment they realized their feelings, not caring whether the other party was about to get married or not...
 

 
But Wei Zekai cared.
 

 
Even if there was a one in a thousand chance that Tong Zhao would choose him, he didn’t want her to become someone who betrayed her partner.
 

 
He was willing to be the shameless person who pined for a married woman.
 

 
But he didn’t want her character to be tarnished in the slightest.
 

 
The comfortable business car had become a cage. At that moment, Wei Zekai wished he could be in his sports car, ignoring everything, pressing the accelerator to the floor, going at a speed of eight hundred miles per hour, with his mood as bright as the sun... But unfortunately, he couldn’t. This car could also go fast, but with Tong Zhao sitting in the passenger seat, he didn’t want to scare her.
 

 
Just as the poor puppy was about to burst into tears, Tong Zhao cleared her throat and said, "I’m not marrying him. We’re not even dating. We’re just friends. He was just teasing you, and you fell for it."
 

 
She then took out her phone to strengthen her argument and sent a message to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [When are we having the wedding?]
 

 
Shí Qianqiu: [Hahahahaha!]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Shall we go get the marriage license tomorrow?]
 

 
Shi Qianqiu: [I’m afraid Wei Zekai will kill me. I’ve already booked the fastest flight to Hawaii tonight.]
 

 
Wow, he’s off to play again. Truly carefree.
 

 
"… Huh?"
 

 
Hearing that voice full of confusion, Tong Zhao finally remembered that there was a silly boy beside her who had been completely fooled: "How long have I been gone? And you already believe that I’m getting married? I don’t know if I should say he’s too good at lying or you’re just too easy to fool."
 

 
"… Oh.”
 

 
Amidst great sorrow and joy, Wei Zekai was stunned into a fool who could only respond with single words.
 

 
After arriving at Yu Long Xuan, Wei Zekai parked the car in his own small garage—because the homeowners here usually own more than one car, many of them buy the garage together with the property.
 

 
Wei Zekai also owned property here and would occasionally be neighbors with Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was only "occasionally" because they didn’t get much time off at the same time, so they didn’t often have the chance to rest at home together.
 

 
"So..."
 

 
The garage was brightly lit, the lights spilling into the car, warming half of his face. His eyes were bright and gleaming, like a stray dog that had just realized it wasn’t abandoned: "You’re still single?"
 

 
"Always have been."
 

 
Seeing that he still had something to say, Tong Zhao didn’t rush to get out of the car.
 

 
Even though it was comfortable, the car was still an enclosed space. In such a quiet environment, the sensitivity to emotions was magnified, and Tong Zhao could feel the tension in the air, making her throat feel dry.
 

 
To Tong Zhao, Wei Zekai had always been the image of a harmless, soft big dog.
 

 
Of course, if she said that aloud, no one would believe it. Wei Zekai without aggression? He was the most proud and unruly second-generation heir in this circle, the hardest to deal with. Ever since he started a serious business and began making money, he frequently snatched projects from older industry veterans. It wasn’t until he became more enlightened that he realized the Wèi family hadn’t invested in him for nothing; he truly had the skills.
 

 
But in front of Tong Zhao, he was just a big goofy dog wagging his tail.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai was staring straight ahead at nothing, his lips tightly pressed together, his eyes shining.
 

 
Suddenly, he turned his head to her: "So you don’t like him?"
 

 
After their eyes met, she smiled first:
 

 
"I do like him in a friendship way, but I never thought about dating him. As for the future, I wouldn’t deny that it’s possible. After all, he’s a very charming man."
 

 
Tong Zhao recalled that her highest admiration for Shi Qianqiu came when they worked together on a film project. A versatile, multi-talented partner, someone who had both aesthetic sense and talent—who wouldn’t like that? It even created the illusion of mutual respect, wanting to spend a lifetime together. But after the work was finished, that feeling gradually faded.
 

 
"I don't want that possibility," Wei Zekai quickly interrupted her.
 

 
"Mm?"
 

 
Wei Zekai stared at her intently.
 

 
He could feel his heartbeat racing, so fast it seemed to merge into one, his chest muscles nearly burning with the intensity, making his emotions surge. He wasn’t the kind of person who got muddled or unclear; he just hadn’t realized before, hadn’t experienced it, and didn’t know that every time he saw Tong Zhao, it was because he liked her.
 

 
That feeling was something more than brotherly affection.
 

 
When had it changed?
 

 
Tong Zhao’s light-colored eyes reflected his tense, almost stiff face. It didn’t seem particularly graceful, but he oddly liked the feeling of filling her field of vision and wanted to keep it that way, as if he had finally figured out the right approach to a problem. The difficult puzzle that once made no sense to him suddenly became clear. His feelings for Tong Zhao hadn’t changed; perhaps, perhaps it had been that way from the very beginning…
 

 
"We first met at school. I was playing basketball, and the ball accidentally got hit out of bounds."
 

 
"You were wearing a school skirt, looking so gentle and graceful, I was really afraid the ball would hit you, but then you..."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed to be recounting the story of how they met in a disjointed manner.
 

 
For him, it was something that had happened a few years ago.
 

 
For Tong Zhao, however, it felt like a memory from a past life, something she could only slowly recall from his narration.
 

 
Tong Zhao had always been athletic, and when she heard his loud warning, she easily caught the basketball, giving him an amused glance. "Xu Zhu was surprised you apologized and thanked me. She said you looked down on everyone and didn’t hang out with girls. She thought your attitude toward me would be really bad.”
 

 
"Right, you two were still good friends back then."
 

 
Wei Zekai said, "I remembered you from that moment."
 

 
Their families weren’t in the same class financially—Wei family’s wealth was far above everyone else's—while the school they attended was a well-known private institution with sky-high tuition fees. Despite the difference in their backgrounds, the two of them surprisingly became familiar with each other. In terms of family background, Wei Zekai was naturally stronger, but in the eyes of their classmates, Tong Zhao was the unattainable, high mountain flower. She had inherited the beauty of her actress mother and had a natural leadership charisma that cared for others in her conversations.
 

 
At that time, these were just potentials.
 

 
She was impressive in school, but once she entered the real world, it wasn’t enough. And back then, Tong Zhao hadn’t had the chance to slowly nurture that potential. She was knocked down by a series of misfortunes... until a fortunate encounter gave her the opportunity to cultivate those small seeds into towering trees across many worlds, which led to the Tong Zhao we know now.
 

 
Tong Zhao was lost in the memories he described.
 

 
Ever since she returned from the quick-travel worlds, she hadn’t allowed Xu Zhu to appear in her line of sight, but before her travels, Xu Zhu was indeed a good friend who had grown up with her.
 

 
If she were to hide "Xu Zhu" in her memories, the person who would take up the most space would be Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had tried countless times to pull himself out of the mire, but back then, they were both so stubborn and loved to argue. The words they spoke to each other were hurtful...
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "It seems like I was really lucky the day I met you."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was just about to muster the courage to confess, was hit with a blow.
 

 
The feeling was like being fed sugar by a master.
 

 
"Is... is that so? You're really polite, good buddy."
 

 
He got too shy and couldn’t express himself clearly.
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Wei Zekai realized he couldn’t keep calling her "buddy." He gripped the steering wheel, swallowed hard, and his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
"I’ve figured it out."
 

 
"I've liked you from the very beginning.”
 

 
"It's not the kind of liking that friends have, and I don't want to be just a brother."
 

 
"I want to be your boyfriend."
 

 
It was too shy.
 

 
Wei Zekai knew that when he thought too much, things tended to go wrong. So, he simply shut off the connection between his brain and his heart, and everything he had been hiding inside, he laid bare for Tong Zhao to see.
 

 
Each word was unthought-out but carried the feelings that had settled in his heart for a long, long time.
 

 
Long enough that in the previous life, he never had the chance to say it.
 

 
After he said everything he needed to say, the sensor light turned off, as there had been no movement for a while. The only light left in the car was the interior car light, casting shadows that deepened the handsome contours of Wei Zekai's face, making them hard to discern.
 

 
"...Hmm, I guessed it."
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
If she had really been surprised, her emotional intelligence would be on the same level as Wei Zekai’s.
 

 
Her thoughts drifted far away, remembering how in her past life, she too had been an innocent fool without any experience in relationships. She and Wei Zekai had a huge argument, though she couldn’t remember the reason. She told him to get lost, that she didn’t need him to care. Could a friend care for a lifetime? He got angry and said, "So what if I want to care for a lifetime? I’m Wei Zekai. I can care for you all my life." The words sounded very childish, but looking back, it was probably mixed with love, even if she didn’t understand it at the time.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, her lips curling. "Being stupid is really a sin."
 

 
"...?"
 

 
Wei Zekai, the confused little puppy, didn’t understand if he was being scolded.
 

 
Being stupid means not understanding. Not understanding means missing out.
 

 
And once something is missed, it’s gone forever.
 

 
This wasn’t funny.
 

 
Wei Zekai grew anxious. "No, don't think I’m stupid. Actually, I’m quite smart." He brought up some of the recent projects he had successfully completed, afraid that Tong Zhao would misunderstand and reject his confession because she thought he was foolish.
 

 
"I didn’t say you’re stupid, I just remembered one thing I didn’t finish," Tong Zhao said, raising her hand. Her cool fingertips touched his cheek, then she grabbed his wrist and leaned in to kiss him.
 

 
"You made me a little unhappy because you took so long to figure it out, little puppy.”
# Chapter137: Emotional Extra (3) Pampering Zhao Zhao
A long, lingering kiss.
 

 
Wei Zekai remembered the time when they were filming ‘Sea King Killer’. They had shared a kiss like this before, one that he spent many nights thinking about before he could finally push it from his mind. Back then, he had felt that his brotherly feelings for Tong Zhao were beginning to change, which he thought was wrong. It was something from a long time ago, something he had thought he had completely forgotten. But when their lips met, that familiar sensation rushed back vividly.
 

 
This time, it wasn't for a movie, it was real life.
 

 
One of his wrists was held by her, and he could only use his other hand to gently pull her by the back of the head, deepening the kiss.
 

 
So this is what kissing feels like?
 

 
It wasn't the sweetness described in novels. Wei Zekai tasted the flavor of lipstick on her lips. More than the warmth of her skin, it was the temperature of their mucous membranes, the tension in their lips and tongues entwining. He forgot to close his eyes and even saw her long, curled eyelashes, delicate like a doll. He felt a thrill as if he were doing something bad—he had always wanted to do this with his good friend, to kiss her, to know the taste of her tongue.
 

 
When they pulled apart, Tong Zhao's pupils were slightly darker. She asked him, "What are you thinking?"
 

 
"I..." Wei Zekai, his mind blank, curved his lips, now smeared with lipstick. "What should we name our kids?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Tong Zhao reminded him, "Let me educate you—kissing doesn't make you pregnant."
 

 
"...I know! I was just nervous!"
 

 
Wei Zekai shot her a reproachful look, then furrowed his brows, feeling that the situation was more complicated than he thought. "Do you just want to play with me, or don't you want to marry me?"
 

 
How should she put it?
 

 
Tong Zhao also couldn't understand why, in this day and age, someone would think about marriage just after a single kiss. The car had the heater on, the air was a bit stuffy, and after their passionate kiss, Wei Zekai's face was flushed, making his usual bold, unruly expression soften with an inexplicable shyness.
 

 
The more she looked at him, the cuter he seemed, and her lips involuntarily curved into a smile.
 

 
This smile, however, drove Wei Zekai crazy.
 

 
"What's so funny?! I'm really good at this!"
 

 
Confident in his skills, Wei Zekai kissed her again with lightning speed. She had previously grabbed his wrist, so he now grabbed her waist and the back of her neck, kissing her fiercely. The description of it is not appropriate...
 

 
But actually, it wasn’t that bad.
 

 
The car was cramped, and she could feel the almost scorching warmth of his lips and tongue, along with his sharp canine brushing against her tongue, making her feel like she'd been nibbled on by a dog.
 

 
When Wei Zekai had had enough, she gently pushed him away. He only loosened the kiss but still awkwardly held onto her in an uncomfortable position.
 

 
Tong Zhao honestly expressed her feelings.
 

 
Wei Zekai, embarrassed and angry, retorted:
 

 
"Fine, I'm a dog! I used to be wild, but now I'm domesticated. You better keep me on a leash."
 

 
Tong Zhao was amused by his clumsy attitude, and with a deep smile, she responded, "Okay," while hooking her hand around the back of his neck and gently pulling him closer:
 

 
"Good boy."
 

 
＊
 

 
Tong Zhao’s relationship wasn’t something to be taken lightly, and she wasn’t just playing around with Wei Zekai; she was serious about their relationship. So, how to make it public became a priority on their agenda. Her team held a meeting for an entire day to come up with a public relations strategy, which felt absurd and unreal.
 

 
But it was necessary.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had been involved in a few scandals in the past, all of which had been cleared up, and since she and Wei Zekai were childhood friends and business partners, the public was already sensitive to them being seen together. Only some fans who supported their relationship would say they’d just gotten another dose of "new sugar."
 

 
Considering his girlfriend’s public relations needs, Wei Zekai behaved quite well. After confirming their relationship, he acted no differently than before.
 

 
Work was still work, and play was still play.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a little surprised.
 

 
Her team began to drop subtle hints, bringing their gossip back into the public eye.
 

 
A marketing account commented on the compatibility between Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, and netizens began to realize just how much this handsome second-generation rich young man had improved since his role in ‘Sea King Killer’. People tend to be more lenient when it comes to characters they've watched grow over the years, and as they spoke of him, their impressions became more positive. Additionally, the Wei family had always been generous with charity under the name of their only son, creating an image of a socially conscious genius entrepreneur.
 

 
Wei Zekai rummaged through old boxes and handed some photos from their middle and high school days to the public relations team.
 

 
With the hype being deliberately stirred up, public opinion became increasingly loud.
 

 
Industry professionals with a sharp sense had already guessed that she was likely to go public with her relationship.
 

 
Every media outlet was eager to get exclusive information about Tong Zhao’s love life.
 

 
However, ever since she won the award for ‘Iya Myth’, the usually low-key actress had only taken on a few high-profile commercial events. The latest variety show she had filmed wouldn’t air for another two months, so there was no way to catch her.
 

 
A few days later, the couple at the center of the gossip finally made a statement.
 

 
They didn't give any media outlet an exclusive, instead, they both posted on Weibo.
 

 
Wei Zekai wrote a long post, recalling sweet memories from their time together, from their middle school photos to game screenshots, to their in-game relationships in ‘King of Glory’ and ‘League of Legends’, photos with their in-game characters, screenshots of their duos in ‘PUBG’, their signatures on one of the Zeshan project contracts, and proof of his investment in Tong Zhao’s film project.
 

 
Their lives had been intertwined with traces of each other, and they had finally come together.
 

 
This official announcement, with its smooth, inevitable tone, was sweet enough to melt many people.
 

 
What moved netizens the most was the final paragraph of Wei Zekai’s post:
 

 
[I’ve known since the day I was born that I’d never have to worry about food or drink. I didn’t know what was good or what was bad.]
 

 
[Being proactive? If where I stand is the finish line, what direction should I take to move forward? It wasn’t until I met that girl who almost got hit by my basketball. She caught my mistake, smiled at me, and generously forgave me. Since then, I started paying attention to everything about Tong Zhao. From that moment on, my life had a source of light, and I no longer felt lost. As long as I stay close to her and move in her direction, I’m moving forward.]
 

 
[My life’s motivation is to become more worthy of her.]
 

 
Wei Zekai also shared a puzzle piece.
 

 
One side of the puzzle was a photo of Tong Zhao smiling with her Huaying Award trophy, while the other side was a photo that netizens had never seen before—a candid shot from her high school days, holding a certificate on stage. From the angle, it seemed like Wei Zekai had secretly taken the picture from below the stage with his phone.
 

 
In his eyes, she was always the most dazzling presence.
 

 
With the groundwork already laid, the comments were unsurprisingly supportive. Fans’ basic comments included reminders for him to treat Tong Zhao well, while the rest of the popular comments were more typical:
 

 
[Childhood sweethearts with a fairy tale romance!!!!!!]
 

 
[Men who can write little essays are so rare, ‘sob sob sob’, I feel like I’m in the civil affairs bureau!]
 

 
[I saw the date they linked their couple relationship, so you really weren’t together before? Oh my gosh, you guys are truly best friends.]
 

 
Compared to the male side’s announcement, the female side’s official post was as simple as a steel straight guy’s tweet—
 

 
@Tong Zhao v:
 
This time, I didn’t miss it. @Wei Zekai
 

 
There wasn’t even a picture attached.
 

 
The caption was written by Tong Zhao herself, and the team respected her decision. As for the lack of pictures, they couldn’t decide on what to use during the meeting—couple photos were too mushy, items like matching game controllers, limited edition sneakers, luxury cars, or clothes were all rejected. At one point, Wei Zekai even suggested a matching private jet, but that was also turned down.
 

 
So, they chose no pictures over pictures, letting netizens slowly figure it out, which suited her style.
 

 
That is, personal matters were not to be displayed to the public.
 

 
What does “didn’t miss it” mean?
 

 
It sounds a bit painful.
 

 
Some netizens went to ask Wei Zekai on his Weibo, but he didn’t respond, because he honestly didn’t know either.
 

 
The real answer could only be known by Tong Zhao herself.
 

 
Netizens were dying of curiosity, eager to know how a fairy-tale couple like them dated—however, the reality was harsh. The obscure, indifferent, 18th-tier celebrities tried to ride the trending search by showing off their love, while the internationally renowned actress and her billionaire boyfriend remained so low-key that even their couple photos were rarely leaked.
 

 
This was supposed to be the sweet, honeymoon phase after confirming their relationship!
 

 
No couple photos?
 

 
No cute daily love moments?
 

 
Not appearing together on variety shows?
 

 
So how exactly does this fairy-tale couple date?
 

 
Tong Zhao was wrong.
 

 
She was really wrong.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously thought that Wei Zekai was very calm about dating, since they were already familiar with each other. What hadn't they done besides kissing, hugging, and holding hands? At the time, she admired him and thought that Zekai had a broad perspective. However, since officially announcing their relationship and receiving the recognition and status from Tong Zhao’s PR team—“Now that you've publicly announced, you can freely enjoy your sweet romance”—Wei Zekai had lifted the seal.
 

 
After getting Tong Zhao’s consent, Wei Zekai secretly moved into her house—after all, she had plenty of guest rooms, and the security and privacy at Yu Long Xuan (the name of the estate) were more than sufficient to guarantee his safety. Even when he was single, many people knew that they were neighbors living in the same community.
 

 
Next came the couple avatars and couple signatures on all their gaming and social media accounts.
 

 
All the games.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind about game IDs—just a random string of characters. Some of her accounts even had randomly typed gibberish as IDs. So, she allowed him to do it: "I’m too lazy to go change them one by one. You know the passwords, you do it."
 

 
A few days later, when she logged into the game during the break, she saw the group named: (Spoiling Zhao Zhao).
 

 
The personal signature read: [Playing King of Glory for Zhao Zhao].
 

 
Tong Zhao: "..."
 

 
Thank you, that’s a bit too cheesy.
 

 
Her gibberish ID was also changed to "Zhao Zhao."
 

 
Short IDs like this were quite expensive, but things that had a price tag weren’t a problem for Wei Zekai. If it could be bought, he’d just get it.
 

 
And this was just the beginning.
 

 
Tong Zhao's entire gaming profile seemed to have become a collection of online couple IDs, with all sorts of styles. There were also dedicated groups, and from them, it was clear that Wei Zekai had labeled himself as [Husband], [Boyfriend], [Baby], [Sweetheart], [Bodyguard]... The list went on.
 

 
In the past, when they played together, Wei Zekai would want to team up with her as their duo.
 

 
Now, when they played together, Wei Zekai would say: "Baby, put Yao Yao on my head."
 

 
Tong Zhao, the gold medal mage, responded with a question mark.
 

 
The wild king from before quickly backed down: "Then I'll play Yao Yao and put her on your head."
 

 
That was much better.
 

 
The family dynamics were simple, clear, and straightforward.
 

 
And then later…
 

 
When the Zeshan team played together, they were shocked to discover that the former wild area mad dog not only had a fully leveled support character but was also calling out in voice chat: "Baby, come meet me at the fountain." "I don’t want to go home alone, come pick me up." And, "That marksman just hit me, go and kill him!"
 

 
He even sent heart gestures to Tong Zhao.
 

 
It was terrifying! How had they never noticed that Wei Zekai had this tough yet tender side?
 

 
The key was, he was having so much fun with it.
 

 
Whenever their opponents called him a "green tea Yao," he would proudly hang Yao on the mid-lane, showing off.
 

 
[All] Zhao Zhao: I spoiled him.
# Chapter138: Variety Show Extra (1)
What’s it like to have your idol explode in popularity?
 

 
Endless schedules, being able to see your idol's heavenly beauty every day, no longer needing to explain who your favorite star is in the vast sea of celebrities, not having to worry about your idol lacking resources, just having to worry about whether you can keep up with it all...
 

 
It’s so blissful.
 

 
Basically, every fan of a reality show contestant dreams of the day when they can make it alongside their idol.
 

 
But what’s it like when your idol becomes a film queen?
 

 
You can get a glimpse from the comments under Tong Zhao’s Weibo.
 

 
[Sis, can you appear on some variety shows? Even a livestream for sales would be fine, or a gaming stream? I miss you, sis.]
 

 
[Skip the sales, just go on more variety shows.]
 

 
[When was the last time we saw you in public? Oh, it was when you were hosting the charity auction gala, Little Zhāo.]
 

 
[Only shows at that level can afford to invite Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[6 tears, want to see a couple’s variety show, want to see you dominate the trending searches!]
 

 
Looking back, it feels like Tong Zhao’s debut was just yesterday.
 

 
Fans miss those days so much. Every movie would have variety shows in between, and she’d frequently make appearances.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao never really followed the idol path; it was just that her superstar aura was too strong. Not only did she have great works, but she also attracted fans, who worshiped her like a goddess. Since Tong Zhao won the Best Actress award at the Huaying Awards for ‘Iya Myth’, her crown became even more solid. She quickly became known as a top actress… which also meant that, unless absolutely necessary, her public exposure was reduced.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had already passed the stage where she needed excessive exposure.
 

 
Fans could only wait endlessly.
 

 
Fans from other fandoms, hearing their own idols complain, couldn’t help but feel a bit of the ‘Versailles’ effect — their own idol would be overjoyed just to get a supporting role in a big production, fighting tooth and nail over that minor role, and debating for days and nights over secondary billing, but Tong Zhao? She had a top-tier team serving her, and as long as she nodded, hundreds of millions in investments would fall into place. No matter which set she joined, she would be guaranteed the lead role, and no one could take it from her.
 

 
Isn’t that unfair?
 

 
It ‘is’ unfair, but fans also just really want to see more of Tong Zhao…
 

 
With nothing to do, fans would comment under Wei Zekai's Weibo, asking him not to hide his girlfriend and urging him to let Zhao take on more variety shows and appear more often.
 

 
Wei Zekai replied to this lucky fan’s comment: [Do you think I have a say in her acting career?]
 

 
[...That makes sense.]
 

 
[The family hierarchy is pretty clear.]
 

 
[How about some couple photos to show off?]
 

 
Not long after, the fan received a game screenshot.
 

 
The fans collectively sighed in frustration.
 

 
They wanted to see ‘actual’ photos of her!
 

 
And even if it was a screenshot, it was of Wei Zekai playing the cute support character, Yao, while Tong Zhao was playing Shanguan Wan'er, coldly poking her way through the mid-lane, as if saying, “Do you think you’re worthy of lining up against me?” It was incredibly cool.
 

 
@Wei Zekai: [You all ask for so much [couple photos]]
 

 
The photo was newly taken, showing Tong Zhao in black loungewear sitting on the couch, flipping through documents. Half of her long, fair legs were visible, and her side profile was delicate and cold, exuding a strong, professional woman aura. Meanwhile, Wei Zekai wore a coral fleece pajama with a monster design, making a peace sign next to her, his handsome smile carrying a hint of pride.
 

 
...
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai was reading the comments under his Weibo post with the couple photo.
 

 
"Can't say they're a match made in heaven, just that they're completely mismatched."
 

 
"Where are they mismatched? You have no taste!"
 

 
"Hey, that's not bad, the little monster and its tamer! Sounds a bit suggestive."
 

 
Wei Zekai scrolled down and saw a comment with a lot of likes and replies that kept increasing. Curious, he clicked on it, and...
 

 
A fan had used a Q-version watermelon sticker to cover Wei Zekai's head in the couple photo, turning the couple's picture into a solo shot of Tong Zhao. Other fans were delighted, and the "objectified" Wei Zekai, with an ellipsis on his forehead, was dramatically depicted as the little monster pouting on the sofa, looking up at the owner of the house—Tong Zhao, who was flipping through documents. The caption read, "Baby, your fans are bullying me, aren't you going to do something about it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had been nudged slightly into the sofa, grabbed his neck with one hand and said, "Not enough fun, do you want me to join in and bully you too?"
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Well, it's not like it's impossible."
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled. "Watch the limits."
 

 
The little monster huffed and pouted.
 

 
"Forget it, let's stop looking," Tong Zhao tossed the documents onto the coffee table and snuggled into his fluffy pajama-clad chest. "I'm a bit tired of looking."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had been acting like a little puppy, immediately switched back to his usual tone, dropping the boyish voice. He held her in his arms and gently patted her back, as if soothing a child. "You can wait for me, I'll go over the important points with you once I finish. Don't waste your energy; didn't you read a bunch of scripts the past few days?"
 

 
Tong Zhao softly hummed, her low voice betraying a kind of exhaustion she usually kept hidden from the outside world: "You help me look at it."
 

 
"Okay, baby."
 

 
Helping his girlfriend look over the documents!
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a sense of accomplishment, as though all his hard work in studying was meant for this moment.
 

 
Thanks to her cultivation, Tong Zhao usually had great stamina and mental energy. She rarely felt tired and was even known as a "iron woman" in the industry. But ever since she started dating Wei Zekai, during these private moments of being alone together, these psychological fatigue feelings popped up like mushrooms after a rain, making her want to whine and complain to her boyfriend... Something she never would have imagined doing before.
 

 
Was it because love made her weaker?
 

 
Later, Tong Zhao reflected on her own feelings and realized that after a little whining and complaining during their dates, she felt more energized and focused on her work.
 

 
Consort Chen joked: "As long as you're not a true immortal, everyone needs a place for their emotions to rest."
 

 
It was okay to be a little more forgiving with herself. There was nothing wrong with that.
 

 
Compared to a truly clingy and sweet wife, Tong Zhao was rather cold-natured. Every time she took the initiative for a kiss or a hug, Wei Zekai was as delighted as if he'd won the lottery... Actually, he was probably even happier than winning the lottery. After all, winning a couple of hundred thousand was just a small bonus for his wealth, while a warm hug from his girlfriend meant so much more.
 

 
"Enough hugging."
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her head from his chest and gave a small smile: "I noticed you really like showing off your love."
 

 
Wei Zekai sighed:
 

 
"If it weren't for your team stopping me, I would have paid for a yearly membership on Weibo hot search, just so our sweet little love story could stay in the top ten forever."
 

 
He really wanted the whole world to know how happy he was to be in a relationship with Tong Zhao.
 

 
"…"
 

 
Tong Zhao could only say, good thing they stopped him.
 

 
However, what she actually wanted to say was something else:
 

 
"By the way, Sister Chu also wants me to take on a customized variety show… Let’s go on a variety show together."
 

 
"A couple's variety show?"
 

 
Wei Zekai was excited.
 

 
He didn't usually watch variety shows, but he couldn't resist when Tong Zhao's fans were constantly encouraging him on Weibo to appear on one with his girlfriend.
 

 
Whether it was a couple's show or not didn’t matter; he just wanted to see his girlfriend on screen.
 

 
Wei Zekai was, at most, a somewhat good-looking accessory, or a large decoration.
 

 
He’d wanted to do this for a long time.
 

 
But Wei Zekai had always been reluctant to pressure his girlfriend.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao had brought it up herself, it was a different story.
 

 
"…Okay."
 

 
What Wei Zekai didn’t notice was that Tong Zhao's "okay" came with a slight pause, carrying some hidden meaning. He was so excited about the idea of being on a variety show with Tong Zhao that his little monster tail almost seemed to be wagging in the air.
 

 
*
 

 
Wei Zekai's good mood lasted until he arrived at the filming set and saw his old rival.
 

 
"Why is it you again???"
 

 
"Hey."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu, who had just returned from Sanya, was wearing flashy beach shorts and a T-shirt, with frog-shaped glasses on his head. He was lounging with his legs crossed in an office chair, raising his hand to greet Wei Zekai. Wei Zekai immediately wanted to grab his girlfriend and leave, but then he heard Shi Qianqiu leisurely explain: "Tong Zhao wants to try a brand-new variety show format, and she asked me to direct it. She thinks I'm the one who understands the most about her most charming side."
 

 
?
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow, looking like an irritated little leopard. "She has many sides that only I’ve seen."
 

 
Shi Qianqiu smiled. "Like what?"
 

 
"Like—"
 

 
Before he could finish the third word, Tong Zhao covered his mouth from behind.
 

 
Watching the couple was too amusing, Shi Qianqiu laughed out loud.
 

 
Tong Zhao helplessly said, "Don't try to get him to talk."
 

 
There was a reason for bringing Shi Qianqiu in to direct.
 

 
Ever since confirming her relationship with Wei Zekai, the other personalities in Tong Zhao's inner world had frequently wanted to interact with him, which was essentially like meeting the parents. At that time, Tong Zhao had an idea—since in instinctive filming, her personalities could be modeled in different ways, maybe it would be possible to have all the personalities appear at once during the filming? She mentioned this idea to Shi Qianqiu.
 

 
The answer was yes, but it would put a heavy burden on the actor’s brain. A doctor would need to evaluate her in advance to ensure safety before filming could begin.
 

 
Thus, she asked Shi Qianqiu to lower his status and take on the role of variety show director...
 

 
The first reason was that other directors wouldn’t dare take on the responsibility.
 

 
Secondly, it was because Shi Qianqiu truly understood the charm points of her different personalities.
 

 
Even though it was a very self-interested customized variety show, Tong Zhao still hoped the audience would like her other sides.
 

 
Consort Chen, Duan Ge, Shuyi, Zhao Zai, Lu Xianchang, Hanzhi, Iya, and Tong Zhao herself—these eight personalities together could be described as a group of talents. They could even form two full tables for mahjong, not at all lacking in numbers. A large portion of the variety show budget was spent on modeling, and it was only after confirming that Tong Zhao could support eight similar-looking but distinctly different subconscious personalities that they proceeded with the modeling.
 

 
The explanation for the public had already been planned out.
 

 
They would say that due to family changes, Tong Zhao had long been inclined to imagine herself experiencing various lives in different worlds. There are many people in the entertainment industry with mental health issues, and while Tong Zhao's case wasn't particularly new, creating such specific and varied subconscious personalities was indeed unique.
 

 
After getting rid of the disgruntled Wei Zekai and sending him off to prepare for the shooting capsule, Shi Qianqiu finally asked, "Did you tell him about the shooting content?"
 

 
"No."
 

 
"I guessed as much," Shi Qianqiu smiled and said, seeing through the situation immediately. "Looks like he thought it was a couples' variety show. No wonder he pulled that long face when he saw me. Well, you go ahead and get ready in the shooting room."
 

 
After Tong Zhao left, Shi Qianqiu reminisced about Wei Zekai's expression and couldn't help but smile more as he thought about it.
 

 
Wei Zekai was still young, after all.
 

 
He didn’t know that when shooting a variety show, the one person you must never offend is the director.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu considered himself magnanimous and wouldn’t purposely make things difficult for him, much less resort to malicious editing.
 

 
"Hey, the modeling team, come over here. Add a little tail and dog ears to the male lead."
 

 
After giving this thoughtful instruction, Shi Qianqiu bit into a refreshing, sweet, and crunchy red apple.
 

 
He couldn’t wait for the variety show to begin shooting.
# Chapter139: Variety Show Extras (2) — As Long As It's You, Tong Zhao, I Like It...
"Tong Zhao Confidential File - REAL" is a variety show in a live broadcast format.
 

 
Of course, it will also release a polished, edited version later through post-production.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the length of live broadcasts, the live version’s bullet screen comments (live viewer chat) tend to be sparse, and its topic popularity relatively low.
 

 
But that’s under normal circumstances.
 

 
In the entertainment industry, it is an unspoken rule: anything involving "Tong Zhao" must be approached with high expectations and premium standards. Yet, no matter how creative or bold their imaginations are, the actual outcomes often exceed them.
 

 
Just like "REAL"—
 

 
Before the live broadcast even started, the promotional teaser alone had already caused a sensation, breaking records by completely filling hundreds of viewing rooms. Another polished version of a variety show that aired on the same day was tragically ignored, relegated to obscurity, hoping viewers would someday remember to check out its replay. Not only did "REAL" secure the top spot in viewership rankings, but the gap between it and the second place was astronomically large.
 

 
This might just be the difference between legends and ordinary people!
 

 
---
 

 
The Promotional Teaser
 

 
- [I heard they’re modeling all of Tong Zhao’s subconscious types? This idea is crazy!]
 
- [It’s possible in theory, but barely achievable in practice.]
 
- [My idol count just multiplied by eight! My happiness multiplied by eight too!]
 
- [These fans are too wild! I suspect by the time I finish this show, I’ll have face blindness for Tong Zhao.]
 

 
Fans and netizens were already familiar with Tong Zhao’s different subconscious personas through her association’s official reports and Director Shi’s microfilms. So when this topic came up, they could vaguely imagine what it might look like.
 

 
Of course, there were also those simply enjoying this heavenly couple’s romantic variety show.
 

 
- [I want to see Tong Zhao get jealous of herself!!!]
 

 
- [Ah, is this a “Kai’s Harem Experience Card”?]
 
- [Finally, we can see them in the same frame. ‘crying in joy’]
 

 
Under the public’s eager anticipation, the pre-recorded promotional trailer began to play.
 

 
---
 

 
The first scene was an aerial shot—
 

 
Gentle sea breezes, towering mountain peaks stretching endlessly, and a luxurious castle nestled deep within a forest. At first glance, one might mistake it for a tourism documentary. With Shi Qianqiu's mastery of the camera, the sequence was stunningly picturesque.
 

 
However, the castle didn’t exude much warmth.
 

 
It was shrouded in dark clouds occasionally illuminated by flashes of lightning, appearing grayish and somewhat eerie.

[This instinctive variety show is a reality show of the heart.]
 
[Revealing the truest side of public figures.]
 

 
[So, what is the true nature of the famous actress Tong Zhao, known for her diverse subconscious personas? The production team has gone to great lengths to uncover her different sides—]
 

 
At this moment, the promotional video cut to a behind-the-scenes interview.
 

 
At the center of the screen was Shi Qianqiu, wearing sunglasses.
 

 
The comment section erupted with playful criticism:
 

 
- [Why is he wearing sunglasses indoors?]
 
- [And of course, it's the classic aviators.]
 
- [Let me hear the nonsense he's about to say.]
 

 
"It's honestly a hassle," Shi Qianqiu said with a tone that was both exasperated and full of admiration. "Tong Zhao, just how many surprises are you hiding from us?"
 

 
Once this statement was played, the footage quickly transitioned back to the castle interior.
 

 
As the comments speculated that Shi Qianqiu had only appeared to show off, the screen revealed a woman descending a spiral staircase lined with red carpet.
 

 
The castle’s interior was designed in a Western style, but the woman wore a traditional Eastern ceremonial dress. The fusion of East and West created an unexpectedly striking aesthetic. She appeared to be a youthful version of Tong Zhao, her delicate smile and the charm in her eyes effortlessly captivating the viewers.
 

 
It was Tong Zhao—anyone could tell at a glance.
 

 
But…
 

 
Tong Zhao rarely displayed such a charming and alluring expression. Only her most devoted fans could recall this signature demeanor from her cameo as the imperial concubine in ‘Emperor Ming’.
 

 
She exuded a seductive elegance, but it was clear to viewers that this wasn’t a woman to be casually disrespected or teased. As she faced the audience and curved her lips into a slight smile, a name and a brief introduction flashed onto the freeze-frame with dramatic "bang bang bang" sound effects:
 

 
[Consort Chen.
 
Tong Zhao once fantasized about traveling to a distant time and place, rising from obscurity to become the most favored Consort in the palace.]
 

 
To justify why each persona had such detailed backstories, Tong Zhao had to embrace a youthful, "cringe-worthy" phase of her imagination where her teenage self had an overactive imagination. After a moment of surprise, the audience burst into laughter:
 

 
- [Wait, this is a thing? I didn’t see that coming!]
 
- [Carrying Consort Chen, and I’m sprinting 100 meters already!]
 
- [So even Sister Zhao daydreamed about legendary lives like the rest of us? Feels so relatable!]
 

 
Among all the personas, Han Zhi and Iya had the thickest barrage of comments.
 

 
The former naturally attracted a wave of "girlfriend fans," while the latter was an internationally renowned character. After ‘Iya’s Myth' won an award, Director Shi Qianqiu, seeing the film’s potential, managed to have it released in international holographic cinemas, where it surprisingly achieved impressive box office results. This introduced the goddess's charm to foreign audiences.
 

 
When fans learned that the character Iya was inspired by Tong Zhao's youthful imagination, they admired her even more.
 

 
"She’s too imaginative!"
 

 
Some fans even suggested that since all of her personas were so charming, each could be turned into a movie, which would undoubtedly result in multiple blockbuster hits. This idea became a popular comment, with fans treating it as a fun fantasy—unknowingly hitting close to the truth.
 

 
After all the personas made their entrances, the narrator’s voice, clear and expressive, concluded with a teasing remark:
 

 
[When they all gather together to face Tong Zhao’s official boyfriend, Wei Zekai, what kind of sparks will fly?]
 
[Let’s stay tuned to find out!]
 

 
The final shot froze on Han Zhi’s stunned expression as she turned her head.
 

 
- [Hahahaha, this is too much!]
 
- [The first girlfriend fan to have their idol’s “house collapse”—but instead of a sister-in-law, it’s…]
 
- [How do I even describe this appropriately?]
 
- [Ahhh, I can’t wait to watch the full episode!]
 

 
With the buildup provided by this setting, the audience came to accept the idea that these personas represented different stages of Tong Zhao’s worldview. Some experts speculated that Tong Zhao’s brain might be more developed than average, allowing her to store more detailed memories. However, since Tong Zhao declined to undergo further testing, mainstream opinion settled on the idea that she was simply a unique case, leaving the truth a mystery.
 

 
Because Tong Zhao was so famous, some companies tried to cultivate new talents by encouraging them to develop diverse personas. However, this led to a few awkward and mismatched cases, and the idea was eventually abandoned. They had to accept the reality that her success was one of a kind.
 

 
---
 

 
The live broadcast began!
 

 
---
 

 
Wei Zekai slowly opened his eyes.
 

 
He found himself in a semi-lucid state, processing the background information provided by the scenario designer.
 

 
Although he wasn’t given a new identity, he was aware that he was still Wei Zekai, retaining all his real-life memories. The only additional context was a logical acceptance of the following:
 

 
- The eight women he would meet soon were all versions of Tong Zhao.
 
- The castle they were in was a projection of Tong Zhao’s subconscious mind.
 

 
[You are Wei Zekai.]
 
[You wish to propose to your beloved girlfriend. But like every man seeking to win his heart’s desire, you must first earn the approval of certain individuals.]
 
[The difference? These individuals aren’t her elders.]
 
[They are the different versions of Tong Zhao.]
 
[Do you have the confidence to win them over?]
 

 
In the live broadcast, Wei Zekai was seen sitting in a taxi. The driver asked him, “Young man, the place you’re heading to is really remote, huh?”
 

 
Wei Zekai instinctively replied, “Yeah, my girlfriend lives in a pretty out-of-the-way spot.”
 

 
As the conversation ended, the taxi turned onto a narrow road. The view opened up to reveal the castle from the promotional video. After paying the fare, Wei Zekai picked up his suitcase and began walking toward it.
 

 
Surrounding the castle was a moat, with tall, spiked fences lining the edge—symbolizing Tong Zhao’s strong defensive nature and her territorial instincts.
 

 
Viewers who enjoy instinct-based reality shows often have a bit of voyeuristic curiosity.
 

 
For Tong Zhao’s fans, this custom-made show offered a chance to glimpse their idol’s truest self, worth pausing frame by frame to analyze and write essays about.
 

 
[So this is Her Majesty the Queen’s inner world?]
 
[If it were me, it’d probably be a tiny house full of silly decorations.]
 
[Hahahaha!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, wasn’t fazed. Standing in front of the grand gates, he shouted, “Baby—I’m here—let me in!”
 

 
As soon as Wei Zekai finished speaking, a giant black rose on the castle’s gate unfurled its petals, revealing a hidden fingerprint scanner. When Wei Zekai placed his hand on it, the system recognized his identity, and the rose gate opened with a creak as the drawbridge lowered.
 

 
The moment Wei Zekai stepped onto the bridge, it seemed to come alive, automatically sliding him forward.
 

 
Then, a magical scene unfolded.
 

 
The once gloomy and ominous castle transformed in an instant as the gates closed behind him. The dark clouds scattered, revealing the castle’s true nature—an idyllic paradise full of spring warmth, chirping birds, and vibrant flowers. It was a dreamlike vacation haven, reflecting Tong Zhao’s inner world when she was with someone she trusted and loved.
 

 
This breathtaking visual immediately captivated the audience.
 

 
[Wow, the director really is Shi Qianqiu—he’s amazing at creating concepts.]
 
[What kind of “spoiling the boyfriend” setup is this? All her favoritism goes to him?]
 
[Oh my god, the bridge moves on its own, taking him straight to her heart. I never expected Zhao Zhao to be this sweet when in love.]
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t great with words of affection.
 

 
When she loved someone, she showed it through her actions—by treating them well and keeping them close.
 

 
Wei Zekai stumbled forward and finally arrived at the castle’s grand entrance, only to face his first challenge.
 

 
Standing before the doors was a tall, imposing man dressed as a butler.
 

 
He bore a striking resemblance to Tong Zhao, sharing about seventy percent of her features, but his sharper facial structure and restrained gentleness set him apart.
 

 
This was Han Zhi, a familiar figure to Tong Zhao’s devoted fans.
 

 
In the next moment, those fans witnessed an unfamiliar side of their idol’s on-screen boyfriend.
 

 
Han Zhi, upon seeing Wei Zekai, furrowed his brows slightly. His handsome face showed clear disdain, as if he were reluctant to let this man pass.
 

 
“You’re supposed to be ‘my’ boyfriend?”
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned. “...Baby, did you ever have a phase where you wanted to be a boy?”
 

 
“First of all, don’t call me ‘baby’. Call me Han Zhi,” he replied coolly.
 

 
“In a period of gender identity confusion and questioning the meaning of existence... yes, Tong Zhao once fantasized about what it would be like if she were a man. And as you can see,” Han Zhi lifted a hand to adjust his tie. The slight movement drew the attention of the female audience to his sharp jawline and the subtle motion of his Adam’s apple. “A more aggressive, dominant male side. Can you accept that?”
 

 
...
 

 
Wei Zekai’s expression looked as if his tail had been stepped on—absolutely flustered.
 

 
This was a sore spot for most men, and he was no exception.
 

 
But...
 

 
“So, are you still Tong Zhao?” he asked.
 

 
Han Zhi nodded indifferently.
 

 
Wei Zekai gritted his teeth. “As long as you’re Tong Zhao, I’ll like you!”
 

 
As soon as the words left his mouth, Han Zhi looked surprised.
 

 
Not because of his heartfelt declaration.
 

 
But because, with a loud ‘poof’, a dog tail popped out from behind Wei Zekai.
# Chapter140: Variety Show Extras (3)
"..."
 

 
The scene froze in awkward silence.
 

 
Wei Zekai, panicking, tried to press down his tail, but to no avail. The once-erect fluffy tail drooped in nervousness. "What the hell? Why do I have a tail… I…"
 

 
"It's probably a construct of the subconscious world. In Tong Zhao's mind, anything is possible," Han Zhi explained, though he offered no consolation.
 

 
Instead, those melancholic, unreadable eyes carried a trace of a faintly mocking smile. "It’s… quite cute."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked like he had just been struck by lightning.
 

 
The AI voice picked up his inner thoughts:
 

 
[So...]
 

 
[In Tong Zhao’s eyes, am I just… a dog?!]
 

 
The barrage of comments on the livestream exploded with laughter, filling the screen with "hahahaha."
 

 
Wei Zekai's dog tail gave a despondent wag before a husky female voice came from behind Han Zhi.
 

 
"Han Zhi, who are you talking to?"
 

 
"A little puppy," Han Zhi replied calmly.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s head and tail both shot up as he looked toward the owner of the voice.
 

 
The newcomer had neatly styled short hair, and her small face, about the size of a palm, was framed by almond-shaped eyes with pale-colored irises. Her features resembled Tong Zhao’s, but the short hair made her features more defined, and she seemed slightly taller than Tong Zhao—perhaps due to some kind of stimulus from the post-apocalyptic world that caused a secondary development. Upon seeing Wei Zekai, she immediately smiled. "Xiao Kai."
 

 
"Uh, hello."
 

 
Wei Zekai greeted her politely, his handsome face showing clear signs of wariness and confusion.
 

 
She looked like his girlfriend.
 

 
But she wasn’t her.
 

 
[Is this another side of Tong Zhao...?] Wei Zekai thought, feeling somewhat lost.
 

 
"I’m Duan Ge," she introduced herself, then nudged Han Zhi to move aside. "Don’t just stand there, come inside, and stop picking on the kid."
 

 
Once Duan Ge spoke, Han Zhi stopped teasing Wei Zekai. He raised an eyebrow, a look that prompted a wave of screenshots from fangirls. "I wasn’t picking on him."
 

 
"True," Duan Ge said, as if recalling something amusing, and gave a small smile. "Wait until he meets the Consort, then he’ll know what real bullying is."
 

 
[Ahhh, I love this subconscious side of hers. So badass!]
 

 
[I think she’s more dominant than Brother Zhi... is that just my impression?]
 

 
[I became a fan of Tong Zhao after watching ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ and ‘One Life Survivor’. While her other works are also charming, they never quite gave me that heart-fluttering feeling... But after seeing Duan Ge, I realized—I like this type! I want to stick close to Duan Ge! I want her to step on my face with high heels!]
 

 
The last comment was quickly met with others criticizing the person for being a bit off.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt a little uneasy.
 

 
From what she said, was the "Consort" a very frightening character?
 

 
His anxiously swaying tail betrayed his nervousness.
 

 
[But—]
 

 
[If it’s all still Tong Zhao in the end, then there’s nothing to fear.]
 

 
When this thought of Wei Zekai was captured by the AI, a highly upvoted comment popped up:
 

 
[Thank goodness I can’t read, or I might have been blinded by that.]
 

 
---
 

 
Under the guidance of the two, Wei Zekai entered the interior living room of the castle.
 

 
The living room was very spacious and grand, with the wooden floor polished to a shine, and the décor was in a medieval style. This surprised him a bit because Tong Zhao’s real-life home was designed with a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
 

 
He didn’t expect that she actually longed to live in a castle like this.
 

 
Wei Zekai secretly made a resolution: when he wakes up from the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, he would definitely gift her a castle even more luxurious and grand than this one! Hmm, he might as well customize one as a wedding house. If Tong Zhao wasn’t planning on getting married soon, the wedding house could be used for the engagement—anyway, he just wanted to give her something special.
 

 
In the middle of the living room were two red carpeted stairways, about two meters wide, leading up to the second floor.
 

 
There were many doors on the second floor.
 

 
"Your task during these eight days is to live with two of Tong Zhao's subconscious personalities for two days each. You need to gain her approval and also experience whether you can accept her with different traits."
 

 
As Han Zhi explained, a special effects text appeared at the bottom of the screen to ensure that any viewers who hadn’t heard clearly understood the concept of the show.
 

 
Wei Zekai was startled. "Does that include you?"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Han Zhi made a face as if his limit had been reached, and coldly responded with a simple "Mm."
 

 
He quickly changed the subject. "Go ahead and pick your first door, don’t waste time."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "How about I pick you directly? Let’s start with the hardest option."
 

 
Han Zhi: "…"
 

 
[Hahaha, Brother Zhi’s life is a complete failure.]
 

 
[Help, Wei Zekai is really so silly.]
 

 
[Reminds me of Aquaman Killer.]
 

 
"Fine.”
 

 
Han Zhi's eyelids lowered for a moment, but in the blink of an eye, the initial look of surprise was completely gone, leaving no trace: "Exactly, it's just right. If you're not used to living with other girls, having me, a guy, to accompany you is perfect, right?"
 

 
"You're absolutely right."
 

 
This really struck a chord with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Although he knew they were all Tong Zhao, it was like with Duan Ge: she had a similar outline, but her aura was vastly different. He couldn’t help but instinctively want to keep a distance from other women who weren’t his girlfriend, let alone "live together." He put his arm around Han Zhi's shoulder and remembered something: "Didn’t we meet in ‘Aquaman Killer’? You even kissed Tong Zhao afterward!"
 

 
This event was particularly vivid for Wei Zekai.
 

 
At the time, he didn’t know what was going on during the ‘Instinct Variety’ show, but after waking up and watching the replay, he discovered that the two had been "secretly communicating" without his knowledge. Back then, he was conflicted, asking himself "I actually kissed a bro, and I kissed him so passionately?"—a moral dilemma that felt like being fried on a hot pan, turning over and over. Since he knew that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, he didn’t think too much about it.
 

 
Now, seeing such a large Han Zhi in front of him, even though he knew he was also a part of Tong Zhao...
 

 
He still felt jealous!
 

 
"Yeah, that's right."
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t deny it.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai completely remembered the plot of ‘Aquaman Killer’. Not only had Han Zhi kissed Tong Zhao, but in that variety show, it seemed that Tong Zhao was merely playing with his feelings. For Han Zhi, it was more like a skilled exchange, a mutual appreciation…
 

 
Thinking of this, Wei Zekai’s tail wagged furiously in anger.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him.
 

 
All of Tong Zhao’s personalities understood her very well, and there was no doubt about why she chose Wei Zekai. In fact, it was probably Tong Zhao herself who was the last to realize that she truly liked him.
 

 
"You don't have to overthink it,"
 
Han Zhi said as he walked up the stairs with him. "Pick a door and open it."
 

 
Wei Zekai was still preoccupied with the fact that he had kissed Tong Zhao and was somewhat distracted. He casually picked a door and turned the doorknob.
 

 
The door was surprisingly ornate.
 

 
A golden, jade-embedded door that looked extraordinary from the outside.
 

 
"You not only kissed her, but it was a French kiss!"
 

 
"Stop nagging,"
 
Han Zhi smirked. "You really know how to pick a door."
 

 
When the door was opened, a faint, enticing fragrance wafted out, and Wei Zekai froze for a moment. What he saw was a beautiful young girl lying on a concubine's couch—this was Tong Zhao from his memory, looking just like she did in high school. Her delicate face and eyes, full of life, were gazing at him.
 

 
The girl furrowed her brows slightly.
 

 
Even though she didn’t speak, Wei Zekai could clearly sense her displeasure from his prolonged and impetuous gaze.
 

 
He quickly looked away.
 

 
"It’s you, this thick-headed fool,"
 
she spoke, her sweet voice mixed with an air of arrogance, unlike Tong Zhao’s usual tone. It was as though she had long been accustomed to being in a superior position in a feudal society, constantly reminding others of the distance between them. But with the casual remark "thick-headed fool," she suddenly became more vivid, no longer just a beautiful object to admire. She grumbled in complaint, "Why is it you? I prefer Jiang Dang, and Shi Qianqiu would be fine too."
 

 
[???????]
 
[Is the DangZhao ship real??? Did it just have a bad ending????]
 
[Oops, I guess I have the same taste as the concubine sister, I also like Jiang Dang!]
 

 
When it came to matters of status, Wei Zekai was unwavering: "The people around Zhao Zhao have always been me."
 

 
"You... never mind,”
 

 
The concubine chuckled softly: "Indeed, it's always been you."
 

 
She waved her hand: "Come in and attend to this palace."
 

 
[Bonus scene with the director being called out: "If it's the Consort, I am truly honored."]
 

 
---
 

 
How to serve the most delicate Consort in the world is a technical skill.
 

 
And Wei Zekai clearly lacked the skills required.
 

 
But he was very earnest.
 

 
When the Consort asked him to fan her, Wei Zekai put in all his effort, fanning each stroke with great determination. The Consort's dark hair fluttered in the wind, her face and hair were tousled by the breeze. Instead of getting angry, she smiled and turned to look at him. He showed no signs of stopping, making her feel as though she was facing a wind fan. She laughed in exasperation: "Are you doing this on purpose or is it accidental?"
 

 
"Don’t worry, I'm well-known in the investment world for being both wise and brave. Not only am I sharp, but I also make time every week for fitness training. Don’t even talk about fanning you—I'd have no problem carrying you around."
 

 
The Consort: "..."
 

 
Being carried in a palanquin was a daily routine for her.
 

 
The Emperor occasionally gave her a princess carry.
 

 
However, being carried like a burlap sack was something else entirely. It was like a young girl getting married, or rather, a ghost marriage. Not only was it her first time, but there was also a fear that it might not bring joy.
 

 
The Consort propped her chin up with one hand and turned her face away from the wind: "Well, you're quite good at taking care of people. I’ve learned something new."
 

 
"I’m not good at taking care of people,"
 

 
Wei Zekai responded honestly, modestly praising himself: "I imagined you as a pregnant Tong Zhao when I was taking care of you. You know, putting myself in your shoes, trying to do my best in every aspect, even fanning you with strength."
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been reading nearby, couldn't hold back and laughed out loud.
 

 
The Consort grabbed another feather fan and tossed it at his head, laughing and scolding, "Making a fool of me, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi reacted quickly and easily caught the fan. He walked over to Wei Zekai, signaling him to step aside, and then changed the fanning method to a softer, gentler motion: "You said you were taking care of a pregnant Tong Zhao... well, you really need to learn. The wind from just now won’t do."
 

 
Wei Zekai watched him for a moment.
 

 
The fan was light, and the breeze it created was gentle.
 

 
Wei Zekai tentatively asked:
 

 
"Brother Zhi, did you forget to eat?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
His brother Zhi really wanted to smack the rice bowl onto his forehead.
# Chapter141: Variety Show Special (4) – “If You Dare Say ‘Drink More Hot Water,’ You’re Done For…”
In just half a day, Wei Zekai fully understood the deeper meaning behind Brother Zhi’s comment, “You really know how to pick a door to open.”
 

 
The imperial concubine was truly a master at delegating tasks.
 

 
Running up and down, serving tea and pouring water, was just the basics.
 

 
When it came to giving massages, he almost sent Her Majesty into a state of bliss right then and there.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s utter lack of caregiving skills surprised everyone. Some viewers in the bullet comments speculated it was because he was a super-rich second-generation heir, raised in a life of luxury where everything was handed to him on a silver platter. Having even the awareness to take care of someone was already a feat for him.
 

 
But then the question arose: if Tong Zhao were ever really pregnant, could he handle it?
 

 
[If he casually spends just a little, he could hire 100 nannies, each assigned to care for one of Tong Zhao's fingers.]
 

 
[...The previous comment is so accurate. I'm envious.]
 

 
[So having money really makes it easier to be a "good man." Laughing but also agreeing.]
 

 
When Han Zhi asked the same question, the concubine herself wasn’t worried. She shared the same view as the bullet comments—he’s rich enough to hire people to take care of everything. Her husband only needs to manage the kingdom, keep her entertained when present, and swipe his card for endless shopping sprees.
 

 
After all, back in the palace, there was no reason for the emperor to personally care for pregnant women.
 

 
Specialized skills belong to professionals; leave it to the experts.
 

 
Even the ever-critical and picky concubine didn’t think this approach meant slacking off.
 

 
The audience was in stitches, joking that it was fortunate this was just one of Tong Zhao's passing thoughts. Otherwise, how could she have produced so many great works? She would’ve retired from the industry long ago and gotten married.
 

 
But that’s not entirely true.
 

 
The concubine has an exceptional eye for men, and even someone as wealthy as Wei Zekai isn’t her idea of “the best.” Without power in his hands, he still falls short. She’d rather stick to acting, though her roles might be limited to playing heartthrobs and femme fatales. Even so, in an era dominated by pure cinema, she’d still shine brightly, become the queen of genre films, and captivate countless elites vying for her attention.
 

 
Han Zhi was convinced by her reasoning.
 

 
“I hadn’t thought of it that way,” Wei Zekai admitted, looking confused. “If Tong Zhao had plans for children, of course I’d hire help. But I’d also arrange my work in advance… I’ve heard pregnancy is like being ill. When your girlfriend’s sick, how can you not stay by her side?”
 

 
“So you’d take care of her personally?”
 

 
“Of course. I’ll handle all three meals and midnight snacks too—no problem.”
 

 
Wei Zekai patted his chest in assurance.
 

 
Some viewers found this incredibly sweet.
 

 
In reality shows like Instinct, people often reveal their true selves. Some even become more straightforward than usual.
 

 
Wei Zekai was speaking sincerely.
 

 
However, viewers who had watched ‘Sea King’ joked in the bullet comments not to have unrealistic expectations about Wei "Dog" taking over all three meals. Given his cooking skills, they’d already be grateful if he didn’t blow up the kitchen or give the pregnant woman food poisoning. It’s better for him to focus on earning money to support the family—being a househusband just isn’t for him.
 

 
After some playful back-and-forth in the comments, the consensus was:
 

 
[A+ for effort. On behalf of Sister Zhao and the baby, we appreciate the thought.]
 

 
---
 

 
In the afternoon, the concubine grew tired and sent the two men away, saying she’d rest for a while and call them if needed.
 

 
A young woman in full traditional attire casually saying she’d "call someone"…
 

 
The scene felt so jarringly modern it resembled a time-travel drama.
 

 
Viewers were reluctant to part ways; they wanted to see more of Tong Zhao in her ancient costume. There was a special kind of delight in being bossed around by a beauty like her. Plus, the concubine “rewarded” her servants as she worked them—without showing even an inch of skin, her fleeting glances, teasing smiles, and feigned annoyance were visual treats, a feast for the eyes like having ice cream.
 

 
In one scene, Wei Zekai fanned her too vigorously, directing the breeze straight into the concubine’s face and making the corners of her eyes turn red.
 

 
The bullet comments were stunned:
 

 
[Wait—is this really free to watch?]
 
[I take back everything I said about Wei the rich kid. Please fan harder, thanks.]
 

 
Wei Zekai hadn’t meant to cause trouble, and he wasn’t dumb. After being scolded by the concubine twice, he quickly learned the correct way to serve his girlfriend. Female viewers sighed enviously over his evolution into the ultimate attentive boyfriend. But to Concubine Chen, he was nothing more than:
 

 
“Barely passable.”
 

 
It really isn’t easy to please Sister Concubine!
 

 
So, what could Wei Zekai and Han Zhi possibly do when left alone together?
 

 
At this moment, the show cut to an interview segment from Shi Qianqiu’s omniscient perspective:
 

 
"If you were to spend time alone with Tong Zhao’s boyfriend, what would you want to do?"
 

 
Even without seeing his face, viewers instantly recognized the sly and unmistakably sarcastic voice of Shi Qianqiu. The bullet comments lit up with jokes:
 

 
[Fake dog: Wei “Dog.” Real dog: Shi Qianqiu.]
 

 
In the interview, Han Zhi’s expression turned momentarily blank with confusion before he replied:
 

 
"There’s nothing I’d want to do... Just hope he cherishes Tong Zhao. She’s been through a lot."
 

 
After finishing his sentence, Han Zhi paused, his gaze lowering slightly:
 

 
"It’s never been easy."
 

 
---
 

 
Having no particular plans, Han Zhi took Wei Zekai to his room.
 

 
This room was starkly different from the one he used during live streams with his female fans. It was truly his personal space, one that mirrored his room within Tong Zhao's "Palace of Consciousness." The room was minimalist to the extreme, almost devoid of a lived-in feel. No decorations, no unnecessary furniture, and not even a trace of clutter on the desk. The room was dominated by a black-and-white color scheme, its only exception being a half-burned scented candle on the nightstand, the sole hint that someone actually lived there.
 

 
Han Zhi sat down on the bed.
 

 
Noticing there weren’t any chairs, Wei Zekai didn’t feel like standing to chat, so after a brief moment of consideration, he casually sat down on the floor.
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips curved slightly, almost imperceptibly.
 

 
AI captured his inner thoughts: "I was actually thinking of inviting him to sit next to me... Oh well, never mind."
 

 
Han Zhi had a face that exuded deep emotion. But when listening to his inner monologue, one could occasionally sense traces of aloof detachment.
 

 
Wei Zekai attempted to start a conversation. "Your room... It’s decorated in quite a unique way, huh?"
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, his lashes casting shadows that added a hint of melancholy to his expression. "There was a time when I experienced gender dysphoria."
 

 
There was a fleeting moment of silence, heavy with unspoken context.
 

 
In the past, BL novels featuring gender-swapped protagonists were popular, where the lead characters cheerfully adapted to their new male forms to engage in romantic adventures. But for Tong Zhao's soul, trapped in a male body, things weren’t so simple or joyous. Han Zhi endured a long period of self-doubt, eventually channeling the admiration from his fans as his sole source of validation.
 

 
To Han Zhi, gender became irrelevant. It didn’t matter who he was, or who others saw him as. His entourage of bodyguards and adoring fans served as his protective shield.
 

 
He was a perfect celebrity, so flawless he seemed almost unreal.
 

 
Learning to let go and enjoy life came much later.
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was calm but tinged with residual vulnerability. "Having extra furniture makes it harder for me to sleep."
 

 
"When did this happen?"
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, his tone filled with urgency.
 

 
Tong Zhao had never mentioned it to him.
 

 
Han Zhi immediately pinpointed the source of his worry and chuckled. "She doesn’t like complaining to others."
 

 
She excelled at comforting others, but when she was in pain, she preferred to grit her teeth and endure it silently.
 

 
Han Zhi paused briefly, suppressing a wave of discomfort. As someone who shared the same soul as Tong Zhao, he too disliked airing grievances unless it was to gain sympathy or to emotionally connect with fans. When he did show his vulnerability, it was often a calculated move.
 

 
He said softly, "You’re in a relationship with her, so take the initiative to care for her. If she says nothing’s wrong, just give her a hug."
 

 
"The Noble Concubine's evaluation of you is that you're a late-stage, hopeless straight-laced guy. Your saving grace? You're obedient and easy to command," Han Zhi quipped with a knowing smile.
 

 
"I can teach you how to make her happy."
 

 
Faced with this self-proclaimed relationship expert, Wei Zekai looked stunned.
 

 
Male viewers commented in the livestream:
 

 
[Master, teach me too! Is this valuable knowledge available for free?]
 

 
Female viewers, however, were far more straightforward:
 

 
[I want Han Zhi to make me happy too! Hug Han Zhi!]
 
[It works the other way too. I want to make Han Zhi happy!]
 

 
Some even coined a mock title:
 

 
"Han Zhi’s Guide to Pleasing Your Girlfriend 101."
 

 
Wei Zekai raised his hand nervously. "What should I do when my girlfriend’s on her period?"
 

 
Han Zhi smiled faintly, his expression serene and elegant. "Why don’t you tell me what you’d do first?"
 

 
However, the content scanned by the AI was: "Anyone who says 'drink more hot water' should be buried."
 

 
[Hahaha, "drink more hot water" is so real!]
 
[I think he just read Wei Zekai's mind.]
 

 
Some viewers were confused: [Isn't it bad to be cold during your period? What's wrong with drinking hot water?]
 

 
"Drink... drink... brown sugar water?"
 

 
"..."
 

 
Han Zhi: [It's hard now.]
 

 
[??????]
 

 
[Han Zhi, what are you doing?]
 

 
[Is this really allowed to air???]
 

 
Han Zhi: [My fist is hard now.]
 

 
[......]
 

 
[Alright, Han Zhi, you're amazing.]
 

 
[You AI machines, don't breathe so loudly, damn it!]
 

 
Han Zhi went on, saying everything that needed to be said, then added: "Some influencer accounts show videos of good men saying sweet words, but the truth is every woman is different. If she doesn’t say she wants to hear a story, it’s better to say less. If she’s in pain and sweating, wipe it off for her. If she’s cold and uncomfortable, give her a hug, let her know you're there and that you're patient. Don’t ask if she’s feeling better, she can't control when she'll feel better... Anyway, let me demonstrate."
 

 
On the bed, he pulled the stunned Wei Zekai (pretending to be the "period version of a dog") into his arms, patted his head, and lowered his voice slightly: "Anyway, I won’t leave even when you get better. Rest well, I’m staying with you."
 

 
[How much would this "immersive Wei Zekai experience" cost to buy?!]
 

 
[I’m so jealous of this guy who not only got my sister but is also being hugged by my brother!!]
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was envied and resented by fans, eagerly asked, “Should I memorize this sentence?”
 

 
“No need, when you’re in a relationship, don’t overthink it. Don’t memorize lines.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and said, “Here, I’ll give you a chance for a practical lesson. If I’m uncomfortable during my period, what would you do?”
 

 
From the god’s perspective, Shi Qianqiu understood everything and immediately switched to Wei Zekai’s view, letting the audience clearly see Han Zhi clutching his abdomen, his brow furrowed in agony. The handsome guy’s suffering, combined with an oddly alluring expression, was fully displayed for the audience to see—
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath.
 

 
[Don’t memorize lines…] he reminded himself.
 

 
“I’m here.”
 

 
He said, taking Han Zhi’s hand and reassuringly squeezing it. “I feel for you, let me hug you.”
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
[…Damn! ]
 

 
All the viewers could hear his exasperated, curse-laced thought.
 

 
Han Zhi’s initial discomfort had been fake.
 

 
Now, it was real.
 

 
Wei Zekai, completely unaware that he had triggered Han Zhi’s sensitive spot, was still reviewing and learning: “Tong Zhao never tells me when she’s on her period, so I don’t have any practical experience. You can act it out with me a few more times.”
 

 
Han Zhi quickly retreated three arms' length away and raised his hand to signal him to stop.
 

 
He said, "I just remembered something."
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly asked, "What is it?"
 

 
Han Zhi: "...She doesn't have menstrual cramps.”
# Chapter142: Variety Show Extra (5) The One You Love Doesn’t Need to Be Tested...
It was time for the bi-daily summary interview.
 

 
In the live broadcast, the audience saw Wei Zekai, who had been tormented by the Concubine for two days, walking into the confessional room with a tired expression. Inside the room, there was no priest, only a floating light orb.
 

 
"Hello..."
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at the light orb with some doubt.
 

 
"Hello."
 

 
The synthesized male voice, altered through sound modulation, sounded a little ethereal.
 

 
Narrator: At this moment, our protagonist, Wei Zekai, still doesn’t know the true identity of the host behind the scenes!
 

 
"After these two days of... torment, ah no, I mean, getting to know each other, what are your feelings?" the host asked.
 

 
"You just said torment, right? I definitely heard you say torment!"
 

 
"Please share your thoughts."
 

 
Wei Zekai: "Aren’t you going to explain what you mean by 'torment'?"
 

 
The man and the orb stared at each other for a moment.
 

 
The host orb sighed slowly, then seriously explained, "Of course not! Our show's goal is to help you understand your girlfriend in a warm and loving way.”
 

 
Wei Zekai sat down on the chair, still finding it hard to let go of his wariness toward the light orb.
 

 
But since it was a requirement of the show, he could only be honest.
 

 
"So, it turns out Tong Zhao has such a demanding side. How should I put it? You might think it’s torment, but as long as I think of her as Tong Zhao, seeing that face that’s exactly like hers..." Once he started talking, Wei Zekai was actually quite honest and easy to coax. His cheeks flushed slightly, and he seemed a bit shy. "I actually enjoy being bossed around by her. She doesn’t usually ask for help, and she doesn’t rely on me, so when she does ask me to do something, it feels good."
 

 
Hearing this, the light orb seemed to shrink for a moment.
 

 
For some reason, Wei Zekai had the feeling that this inorganic being was holding back laughter.
 

 
The comments were laughing the hardest:
 

 
[It’s just the Concubine's task.]
 

 
"So, do you think this experience has been helpful to you?" the host orb continued.
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded. "From now on, I’ll know how to take care of her even before she opens her mouth."
 

 
A round of synthesized cheers and applause followed.
 

 
The host orb said, "Congratulations, you’ve become an excellent tool person!"
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail swished irritably a few times, and he muttered under his breath, "I don’t know why, but whenever I hear you speak, I feel this annoying familiarity, you remind me of someone I really don’t like..."
 

 
"That really hurts my feelings. This is our first meeting," the host orb sighed dramatically.
 

 
"Is that so? Sorry, I must have been overthinking."
 

 
"No need to mind, I'm not the petty type."
 

 
The host orb watched as Wei Zekai left.
 

 
The comments were full of reactions, with viewers exclaiming that Wei Zekai wasn't the dog at all.
 

 
The real dog was clearly the director.
 

 
From the viewers' god’s-eye view, it was clear that the one controlling the light orb and talking to Wei Zekai was Shi Qianqiu, who was sitting in the director’s chair backstage. Today, he wasn’t dressed in his usual tropical wind look, but instead wore a casual bunny-themed coral fleece pajama with bunny ears on his hat.
 

 
As Wei Zekai left the confession room, Shi Qianqiu winked at the camera, causing a surge of excitement among viewers, especially those with a fondness for good looks.
 

 
Shi Qianqiu sighed with enthusiasm: "I can't wait for the show to air!"
 

 
[Stop acting cute, Old Thief Shi.]
 

 
[Help, is this the legendary 'disgustingly handsome'?]
 

 
[My heart aches for the Dog for a second.]
 

 
＊
 

 
The second pair was Lu Xianchang and Zhao Zai.
 

 
Although it was unexpected, the personality that got along best with Zhao Zai was indeed Lu Xianchang. Every time Zhao Zai was bullied by the Concubine, she would cry and rush into Lu Xianchang's arms.
 

 
Perhaps because Lu Xianchang knew Wei Zekai had been tormented by the Concubine earlier, her attitude toward him, as someone who strongly resisted men, had softened.
 

 
His job was to play with Zhao Zai.
 

 
In the colorful children's room filled with toys, Lu Xianchang spent time playing various little games with Zhao Zai, which for the wealthy Wei Zekai...
 

 
...was simply heaven!
 

 
The younger version of Tong Zhao was just too adorable.
 

 
After Wei Zekai helped Zhao Zai build a small castle with blocks, he stared at her round little face and couldn't help but sigh, "You know, if I had met you when I was in elementary school, how great would that have been?"
 

 
Zhao Zai, feeling his gaze, defensively clenched the blocks in her hand.
 

 
Wei Zekai gently patted her head, "I wish I had met you earlier."
 

 
At every stage of life, he wanted to go through it with her.
 

 
Zhao Zai nuzzled his palm, and with her bright, clear eyes, she looked intently at this older brother, making Wei Zekai’s heart melt.
 

 
Lu Xianchang asked him why he was staring at the child.
 

 
Without hesitation, Wei Zekai replied, "I want our future kids to look just like their mom."
 

 
Lu Xianchang: "..."
 

 
Crazy.
 

 
The audience saw the elegant, goddess-like figure of Lu Xianchang give an expression of disdain, maximizing the show’s effect.
 

 
The host orb, acting as the representative of the viewers, asked Lu Xianchang, who had always acted so dismissive of men, what she thought of Wei Zekai. She replied:
 

 
"My opinion? What opinion could I have?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang gave the orb a faint glance, as if already seeing through the true identity behind the light ball. Her almond-shaped eyes glinted with coldness. Though her eyes were the same shape as Tong Zhao's, they looked even more distant, pushing people away with an air of aloofness.
 

 
It was as though she was friendly to women, but only in comparison to men. Overall, regardless of gender, she kept a distance from people. "By becoming my independent subconscious, I am preserving Tong Zhao's right to love others. Whoever she loves is good."
 

 
In this fantastical world, after the trauma she witnessed and the profound shock it brought, she found it difficult to get close to anyone.
 

 
The system separated her into a different persona, allowing Tong Zhao to later become a more "normal" person.
 

 
The host orb mischievously stirred the pot: "What if he's not good to her?"
 

 
Lu Xianchang placed her slender, pale hand on her sword—
 

 
"Execute him."
 

 
Narration special effects text: [I really want to see the male lead's head roll.]
 

 
As soon as this line of effects appeared, another popped up: [Director, this is broadcast content, you can't send bullet comments!]
 

 
[—Please forget the previous two lines!]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Shi Qianqiu, stop sending bullet comments!]
 

 
[Stop bullying Wei Zekai!]
 

 
[Well done! I mean, increase the intensity.]
 

 
In this variety show, Wei Zekai might as well be the one with his head rolling.
 

 
He said he wanted to understand Duan Ge, so Duan Ge sat for a while, smoked two cigarettes, and in the end, it was Wei Zekai who quietly said that smoking was bad for the health, which made Duan Ge put out the cigarette. The host orb floated into the living room and suggested, "Maybe a fight would help you understand each other."
 

 
Duan Ge didn’t respond, and Wei Zekai thought that was fine.
 

 
The bullet comments were in a panic:
 

 
[Wei Zekai, ahead is hell!]
 

 
[Help, this episode should be renamed ‘Shi Qianqiu’s Daily Dog Torture’!]
 

 
[Torturing dogs is illegal, Director Shi! Actually, you just want to see him get beaten, right?]
 

 
As the audience expected, Wei Zekai was completely outmatched—he was in full protective gear for the ring fight, and although it didn’t look violent, he wasn’t seriously hurt. He only had minor bruises where he had been hit. Duan Ge thought the kid was kind of cute, so he went easy on him, letting him land a few punches. After feeling the punches, Duan Ge was a bit impressed with how seriously he fought.
 

 
When Duan Ge and Shuyi were together, it seemed like Wei Zekai was living in two extremes.
 

 
Shuyi took Wei Zekai, who had been knocked out, to rest for a while, then brought him to the library in the castle.
 

 
This library didn’t have actual books but was a collection of Tong Zhao’s memory fragments.
 

 
“These are memories from a long time ago,”
 

 
Shuyi picked up a dusty book and opened it, revealing a photo inside.
 

 
The audience saw it was a younger version of Wei Zekai, hurriedly walking toward "himself."
 

 
“Fortunately, it was me who caught the basketball. He apologized to me, promising not to make the same mistake again.”
 

 
“He’s good-looking, but he’s a bit foolish.”
 

 
The second photo showed Wei Zekai, after noticing she was unwell, handing her a Coke and painkillers.
 

 
“I got my period, and he bought me a Coke, calling it ‘fatty’s happy drink...’” Shuyi placed her hand on the book, feeling Tong Zhao’s emotions from that time, imitating her helpless tone.
 

 
“Forget it.”
 

 
“Why do people think he’s scary? He’s really so silly.”
 

 
There were many more, all of them memories of the two of them.
 

 
“I didn’t want to test you—Tong Zhao likes you. What I want to do is just teach you how to understand her,” Shuyi said gently. She resembled Tong Zhao in both her eyes and brows, carrying a warm, compassionate air. “She’s as complicated as this castle, but she doesn’t want to be like this. Can you give her a little patience?”
 

 
Wei Zekai nodded.
 

 
He said, "I feel like I could stay here for the rest of my life."
 

 
＊
 

 
"I really don't understand why you want to stay with me."
 

 
Iya, who had been assigned to live with Tong Zhao, had a cold, ethereal expression on her face.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled gently, wrapping her arms around her and hanging on her like a koala: "God loves everyone, Sister Iya."
 

 
The saintess furrowed her brows, clearly annoyed.
 

 
She knew what the next arrangements would be, so she said, "I have no interest in your little lover. You don't need to show him to me. Who you choose to be with is none of my business."
 

 
Sister Saintess was so hard to please.
 

 
However, when Wei Zekai entered the room, it was just after he had been beaten up by Duan Ge again, a large bruise on his left temple making him look pitiful. After greeting the two of them, Iya waved her hand impatiently: "Come here."
 

 
Wei Zekai, confused, but having learned a lesson over the past few days, knew one important thing.
 

 
That was, whatever his girlfriend said was absolute.
 

 
He had to listen.
 

 
He walked over, but was stopped just one step away. He heard the blindfolded girl say in a disgusted tone, "Don't get too close to me."
 

 
She called him over, but also didn’t want him too close.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tail drooped pitifully.
 

 
However, the next moment, that cool little hand rested on his head and patted it.
 

 
A cool sensation settled on his forehead, and the pain from his injury vanished in an instant.
 

 
When Wei Zekai, surprised, raised his head again, the girl in front of him was gone. Only the Tong Zhao he knew best remained. She pinched his cheek, pretending to be jealous, and said with a smile, "How unfair, she doesn’t treat me well, but why can’t she stand seeing you hurt?"
 

 
"I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to!" Thinking his girlfriend was upset, Wei Zekai wagged his tail furiously, "I didn’t do anything!"
 

 
At that moment, a voice from the director explained:
 

 
[All of Tong Zhao’s subconscious likes and dislikes will shift according to her will.]
 

 
[So, what you're saying is, Xiao Zhao is being tsundere.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, Director Shi even ruins Sister Zhao’s stage while being a tease!]
 

 
[Director Shi has gone mad.]
 

 
Just like Shuyi and Lu Xianchang said, there is no such thing as a test.
 

 
The person you love doesn't need to be tested, and neither does the relationship.
 

 
What matters is not wanting them to suffer or feel pain, but the steady, continuous care and love.
