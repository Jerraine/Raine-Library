# Chapter1
"Transmigrated again?”
 

 
This was the first thought that came to Tong Zhao’s mind when she opened her eyes.
 

 
Ever since she died in a car accident at the age of twenty-four, Tong Zhao had acquired a quick transmigration system. Her soul had completed arduous tasks in many different worlds, and she had long been used to opening her eyes after death, accepting a new identity, and facing new challenges.
 

 
As she sat up to observe her surroundings, she called out to the system.
 

 
Tong Zhao was in a simple, small room. Apart from the bed and a dining table, there wasn’t any extra furniture. Fortunately, there was a private bathroom, so she didn’t have to share it with other tenants. But as for cooking, that was out of the question; there was no gas stove.
 

 
Faced with this predicament, Tong Zhao actually laughed.
 

 
It seems this mission won’t be too difficult.
 

 
After all, the last time she woke up, her soul board was shattered, her four limbs were pierced by Immortal Locking Nails, and she was hung in a heavily guarded water dungeon. Compared to that, this modern world, even with a bit of poverty, was practically a vacation for her.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, what is the mission this time?]
 

 
There was a dead silence in her mind—no synthesized mechanical voice answered her question.
 

 
This had never happened before.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mind was filled with suspicion, but an arrogant and spoiled female voice sounded from outside the door: 'Tong Zhao, I've come to see you.'
 

 
The sound of her name hit Tong Zhao like a bolt of lightning!
 

 
How long had it been since someone called her by that name? She had once been the favored Noble Consort Chen of the Six Palaces, Duan Ge who fought her way through the apocalypse, and Lu Xianzhang, who executed the scumbag that killed his wife to achieve enlightenment... Besides the system addressing her as Tong Zhao, she had almost forgotten her original name.
 

 
And this long-lost, familiar female voice brought a flood of memories associated with this body rushing back to her.
 

 
Tong Zhao hadn’t transmigrated again.
 

 
She had transmigrated back.
 

 
Back to her most helpless and lost eighteen-year-old self.
 

 
It was half a year after her mother’s death, and her father couldn’t wait to bring his mistress, Xu Xinya, and her illegitimate daughter back into the house because the mistress was pregnant with the long-awaited grandson of the Tong family. Overwhelmed, Tong Zhao ran away from home, vowing that even if she starved to death on the streets, she would never have anything to do with that family again.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother had once been a famous film actress, and Xu Xinya was her assistant, as close as a sister.
 

 
When Tong Zhao’s mother was pregnant and it was inconvenient for the couple to have marital relations, Xu Xinya used the excuse of taking good care of her 'close friend' to get close to Tong Zhao's father, and the two of them began their illicit affair in the mansion. One thing led to another, and Xu Xinya ended up pregnant with a child of the Tong family, secretly kept outside.
 

 
Unaware of any of this, Tong Zhao’s mother thought her friend had been deceived by a scumbag, getting pregnant out of wedlock. Out of compassion, she provided financial and emotional support for the mistress. Xu Xinya, in turn, shamelessly took advantage of her kindness to continue her affair with Tong Zhao’s father.
 

 
Later, when Tong Zhao's mother fell seriously ill, Xu Xinya, thinking her time had come, secretly revealed the truth to her by the bedside. This truth severely shocked her, who should have been calmly recuperating, and the double betrayal from both her husband and her friend utterly broke her. She did not survive the coldest winter in Jiangcheng.
 

 
Since she was a child, Tong Zhao has idolized her mother and dreamed of becoming a big star. However, after her mother's death, everything changed. The girl's angry accusations only made her guilty father fly into a rage out of shame. This allowed her stepmother and stepsister to take advantage of the situation and take everything away from her—no living expenses, no place to stay, and all the resources shifted toward the stepsister who also dreamed of becoming a star...
 

 
Outside the door, the chatter continued incessantly:
 

 
'Stop pretending to be dead. I know you're in there. Didn't you say you wanted to sever ties with the Tong family? At least take the things you left at home with you! Look how nice I am, driving over to bring them to you myself.'
 

 
...
 

 
Oh, the one barking outside is her stepsister, Xu Zhu.
 

 
A name her cheap father chose, meaning ‘the lost pearl of the sea.’
 

 
Xu Zhu made this special trip to see her, with two main goals:
 

 
One, to feel reassured that Tong Zhao wasn’t doing well.
 

 
Two, to kick her while she’s down, to ruthlessly beat a drowning dog.
 

 
After all, Xu Zhu had always envied Tong Zhao for living openly in the mansion. Seeing the young lady fall from grace and live a life worse than hers was a scene worth traveling across mountains and rivers to witness. Back then, the eighteen-year-old Tong Zhao obliged, showing her enemy's daughter her most broken and desperate side, crying and yelling at her to get lost.
 

 
Tong Zhao said, 'Just woke up. Give me a moment.'”
 

 
It immediately became quiet outside the door.
 

 
Xu Zhu really wanted to see what her stepsister looked like now.
 

 
If she had to wait, she was willing to wait.
 

 
Back then, she had lain on the bed like a dying dog for several days, tossing and turning as she mourned her deceased mother, filled with hatred but powerless to change anything. Fortunately, after crying herself out, her eyes weren’t swollen at the moment, just her complexion was a bit pale. Tong Zhao rummaged through her bag and took out a makeup kit. With her slender fingers moving quickly, she applied a base makeup and put on a bright lipstick.
 

 
After just five minutes, the person outside couldn’t wait any longer. 'Tong Zhao, I warn you not to leave me hanging out here. If you hate me or feel resentful, then open the door and say it to my face! Are you too scared to even face your own sister…'
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door.
 

 
The voice outside stopped abruptly, and Xu Zhu froze.
 

 
Standing before her, Tong Zhao was wrapped in a silk nightgown, her slightly curled black hair cascading over her shoulders and forehead. Her exposed skin was as delicate and fair as the first snow. The bold lipstick color accentuated the girl's features, making her look even more coldly beautiful.
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her almond-shaped eyes and smiled without a hint of warmth.
 

 
'Speak.'
 

 
…
 

 
Xu Zhu was more than just speechless; she could barely breathe.
 

 
Just two days ago, Xu Zhu had seen Tong Zhao in the living room, having a breakdown while shouting and cursing at her father, then crying as she stormed out of the house. That scene was still fresh in her mind and had been so thrilling that she felt it wasn’t enough. She wanted a classic reenactment, to personally experience the pleasure of kicking someone when they’re down.
 

 
What happened to being down and out?
 

 
What happened to a mental breakdown?
 

 
Both of them took after their mothers.
 

 
One inherited the looks of an actress, while the other resembled the actress's assistant, and the difference in their beauty was immediately apparent.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s beauty was very well-proportioned. From her brow arch down to the perfectly shaped bridge of her nose, her features created a face that could withstand scrutiny from any angle. At first glance, it was clear she was a well-educated young lady from a wealthy family. At this moment, Tong Zhao’s presence was overwhelming; her beauty carried a tangible aura that completely overshadowed Xu Zhu.
 

 
Xu Zhu managed to find her voice again. 'T-Tong Zhao, Auntie hasn’t been gone for long... and you’re already wearing makeup?'
 

 
Although she stuttered a bit, she knew the other person had been through so much misery lately that there was no need to think hard to find a weak spot—one poke would hit the sore point. But unfortunately for her, the person standing before her was no longer the pitiful child who would explode at the mention of her mother. Tong Zhao, who had served as an overseer of the Samsara Mirror in a cultivation world, no longer felt sorrow over her deceased mother—only hatred remained.
 

 
The revenge she owed would not be left unpaid.
 

 
But the jokes her enemies had laughed at before—this time, there would be none.
 

 
"My mom loved to see me looking beautiful. Keeping this beauty she passed on to me well-maintained is the best tribute to her," Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her gaze cold as water falling on Xu Zhu's merely delicate face. She curled her lips into a mocking smile, "Where are the things you brought for me? Hand them over."
 

 
Under the command-like tone of her words, Xu Zhu obediently handed over a large bag of clothes.
 

 
Once her hands were free, Xu Zhu suddenly realized—
 

 
Why was she being so obedient?
 

 
She had come to humiliate Tong Zhao; how could she behave like she used to, obeying her?
 

 
That’s right, back when she was trying to make a living in the Tong family, Xu Zhu had followed her mother’s advice to curry favor with the legitimate young lady, becoming good friends with the original Tong Zhao. Under Xu Xinya’s teachings, she believed that women’s friendships were only for leveraging resources and that it was all about selling at the best value.
 

 
Not only did she want to sell out her friend, but she also resented that Tong Zhao's life was better than hers.
 

 
Truly a champion among traitors.
 

 
"Tong Zhao!" Xu Zhu, ashamed and angry, gritted her teeth at her. "Do you still think you're the eldest daughter of the Tong family? My mom went for a checkup last week, and this time, she's pregnant with a boy. Even if you went back and apologized to Dad, it wouldn't matter. There's no place for you in the Tong family anymore."
 

 
After throwing out this harsh remark, Xu Zhu, still suffocated by Tong Zhao’s beauty, finally felt a bit more satisfied.
 

 
Tong Zhao listened quietly to her rant, and a genuine emotion touched the corners of her smiling lips.
 

 
From Xu Zhu's perspective, she could only see Tong Zhao's captivating eyes, unable to discern the emotions behind her bright red smile. It seemed to carry both mockery and pity, like looking down at a pest chasing crumbs on the ground.
 

 
"From the moment Tong Zhenming betrayed his wife, I ceased to be part of the Tong family. You and your mother have spent half your lives scraping and clawing, discarding morality, dignity, and friendship just to squeeze through that door..."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was cold and lazy, with a hint of a raspy, amused chuckle.
 

 
Even while insulting her, there was a seductive allure in her voice.
 

 
"Sorry, but I find it filthy to even spare you another glance.”
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile faded as she calmly closed the door with her slender, pale hand. She then called the building's security downstairs, saying there was an unfamiliar person causing trouble outside her door and asked them to remove her. In China, there is a great emphasis on public security. An apartment complex may be old, but it must have a certain number of security personnel.
 

 
'Tong Zhao, get out here! What are you pretending to be so noble for? You’re living in this dump. You’re nothing without the Tong family! I’m going to tell Dad what you said, and don’t even think about getting any resources from my family...'
 

 
Sure enough, when the security arrived on the 13th floor, they saw Xu Zhu, angrily kicking the door in high heels and yelling.
 

 
Without much fuss, she was immediately treated as someone causing trouble and escorted away.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s words were half true.
 

 
Back then, Tong Zhao was like a flower in a greenhouse. After leaving the Tong family, she couldn't compete with those who had connections above her, nor could she fight those with tough backgrounds and high emotional intelligence below her. The only advantage she had was a connection her mother had set up for her before she died — the lead director of the TV drama *The Legend of Emperor Ming* was a fan of her mother and, as a favor, gave Tong Zhao a role as a minor concubine, one of the female extras.
 

 
But her past self hadn’t made the most of that single opportunity.
 

 
Due to the nature of holographic filming, actors cannot retain their own consciousness; they can only perform by instinct, fused with the personality of the characters they are implanted with. Therefore, holographic films are also called 'instinctive films.' Most young idols have little life experience, let alone the dramatic experiences of the characters in the movies. The resulting performances often seem superficial, and audiences have grown accustomed to these lackluster performances.
 

 
After being humiliated and provoked by her stepsister, Tong Zhao fell into severe emotional problems. The concubine she played in the film didn’t exude the seductive charm of a femme fatale; instead, audiences only saw a pitiful and panicked girl.
 

 
Those who cared about her were pained, while those who resented her were delighted. Tong Zhao never got another role and watched helplessly as her stepsister gained fame and fortune.
 

 
But this time, having come back…
 

 
Tong Zhao walked to the mirror and studied her face, recalling the first world she had transmigrated into.
 

 
In an ancient time, she was a fox spirit tasked with hastening the downfall of a tyrant—a favored imperial concubine named Chen Guifei. Every official's memorial to the emperor had to begin by praising the emperor and then extolling Chen Guifei's beauty; otherwise, it would be considered a grave offense.
 

 
The more favored she was, the more absurd it became.
 

 
In that instant before the mirror, the thoughts and feelings of Chen Guifei throughout her life flowed through Tong Zhao's entire being.
 

 
Tong Zhao realized that not only could she recall the personalities she had embodied in the past, but she could also wield them at will!
# Chapter2
At the same time.
 

 
While Tong Zhao was exploring her newfound "cheat ability," Xu Zhu, who had been politely but firmly escorted out of the neighborhood by the security guards, got into a luxury car with an unhappy expression. After closing the car door behind her, she took out her phone from her designer handbag and dialed Tong Zhao's father's number.
 

 
Suppressing her anger, she complained in a sweet voice, "Dad, I took my sister's things over to return them and told her that there will always be a place for her at home. I asked her to come back as soon as she got over it. I even said I could move out if it comes to that..."
 

 
"How could we let you move out? Xinya is pregnant with your little brother, and I’m busy with work. She has no relatives to take care of her," Tong Zhenming replied dismissively.
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu felt reassured and continued to stir things up: "I really had no choice. Sister is still angry and won't forgive me. She said she would never be a part of the Tong family again, and she even said..."
 

 
She hesitated, as if unsure whether to continue.
 

 
"What else did your sister say?"
 

 
Tong Zhenming took the bait as expected.
 

 
He always positioned himself as the head of the family and was very annoyed when women and younger family members disobeyed him.
 

 
He didn’t mind a bit of whining or pouting, even if he might have done something wrong. After all, he had apologized! And yet, Tong Zhao dared to point at him and accuse him of being disrespectful in his old age. That girl ate his food and lived under his roof. In his view, no parent is ever truly wrong, and it was not her place to criticize him.
 

 
With his eldest daughter running away from home, Tong Zhenming felt his authority was being challenged. He decided she needed to learn a lesson — to realize that without his protection, she was nothing and could accomplish nothing. The once spoiled princess would be taught by harsh reality and would eventually come back to apologize. All he needed to do was sit tight and wait.
 

 
This was the confident educational insight of a middle-aged man.
 

 
Therefore, Tong Zhenming tacitly allowed his younger daughter to find out where Tong Zhao was living, to see if she had reflected on her actions after a week away from home.
 

 
"Sister also said that she thinks you're filthy and that even looking at you makes her feel dirty. If Auntie had known what kind of person you were, she would never have been with you. After all, plenty of wealthy young men pursued Auntie, and if she wasn't in poor health, she could have remarried anytime, even with Sister in tow..."
 

 
Xu Zhu said timidly.
 

 
She used the most cowardly and innocent tone to spin her little narrative.
 

 
Xu Zhu knew that her father’s proudest achievement was that the famous actress Tong Zhao's mother had favored him among many suitors. He was also very sensitive about the admiration his wife received both before and after their marriage. Even though she had retired from acting and rarely saw outsiders, it still bothered him deeply. Tong Zhenming had complained about this to his mistress many times, and Xu Zhu, having seen and heard all this, knew exactly how to hit his sore spots.
 

 
"Dream on!" Tong Zhenming erupted in anger, trembling with rage. "I raised that ungrateful girl for nothing. Would she be where she is without me? Thinks I'm filthy? Fine, even if she dies out there, I won’t care anymore! She wants to be a star? I had connections lined up for her... Forget it. It’s not like I, Tong Zhenming, only have one daughter. If she doesn’t want to acknowledge me as her father, there are plenty of others who’d kneel just for the chance to call me Dad!"
 

 
Xu Zhu was overjoyed. "But..."
 

 
—
 

 
The father enjoyed making harsh statements.
 

 
The daughter felt that calling him "Dad" while kneeling was worth it.
 

 
Both father and daughter felt that Tong Zhao had greatly underestimated her losses and was in for a rough time.
 

 
“Stop defending your sister. I know what I’m doing. Remember not to tell your mother about this; I don’t want her to be upset.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming impatiently reassured his daughter, ending the conversation with a commanding tone.
 

 
With her father’s promise not to interfere with Tong Zhao anymore, Xu Zhu felt much better and decided to immediately relay the details of the call to her mother. She hoped that even her pregnancy symptoms might improve and that she could enjoy a couple more bowls of rice.
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn’t disappoint Xu Zhu. He efficiently arranged for his younger daughter to participate in a girl group training program centered on youth and growth. With the support of his old friend, President Song's entertainment company, not only was she given a spot on the show, but it was also agreed that Xu Zhu’s name must be included among the main cast of girls in the script, ensuring her debut.
 

 
Once she gained some popularity, she would then tackle reliable but lower-difficulty roles in reputable productions, gradually building her career. This was considered one of the most stable and replicable paths to stardom after the rise of instinctive films.
 

 
If she couldn’t act, she could always appear on variety shows.
 

 
Without dramatic life experiences, being cute and charming on variety shows would still win the audience’s favor.
 

 
President Song, aware of the situation at home, advised, “Tong Zhao will definitely mind about the resources you were supposed to give her being given to your sister. Once she finds out, she’ll likely hold a grudge against you even more.”
 

 
“I want her to know that everything she gets is given by me and that I can take it all back anytime. I can give it to anyone I want. Xu Zhu has been raised too pampered by her mother; honestly, I’m not too fond of her either, but she can be used to balance Tong Zhao and make her realize she’s no longer the privileged only child.”
 

 
Tong Zhenming lit a cigarette and spoke slowly.
 

 
His eyes, clouded by indulgence, were filled with a determined confidence rooted in money and power. Those who obeyed would be rewarded, while those who defied him would lose everything—this was the rule of the Tong family.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s multiple life experiences, she understood that the world operated by many rules.
 

 
Big rules overshadow the small ones.
 

 
The pampered little tyrant from a wealthy family found that no one catered to him at school, and school rules didn’t apply in society. Just like when Tong Zhao, transformed into a favored concubine's daughter with a background of extinguishing wives, shone brightly during the selection, captivating the emperor at first sight. She leaped from the domestic struggle to the palace intrigue arena, advancing in status with her acting skills and strategy. Dealing with those scoundrel fathers, stepmothers, and half-sisters later was a piece of cake.
 

 
Tong Zhao's goal was to step out of the Tong family's circle and explore a bigger stage.
 

 
With a week left before the start of filming for *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor*, Tong Zhao focused on three things at home.
 

 
1. Nurturing Her Beauty
 

 
In ancient times and in the world of cultivation, Tong Zhao collected some natural beauty remedies that proved quite effective. As the saying goes, "Eighteen is free from ugly women." She was already beautiful, but after her mother’s death, she had been crying and suffering from insomnia daily, which had damaged her skin and complexion. A few days of proper care quickly restored her radiant appearance.
 

 
The role of the favored concubine in *The Chronicles of Ming Emperor* was that of a stunning beauty. Regardless of her acting skills, her looks needed to be convincing.
 

 
2. Taking Online Courses
 

 
In her original world, with the maturity and near-universal adoption of holographic technology, physical universities had gradually declined in popularity. People preferred the convenience of this technology. Unfortunately, holographic pods were very expensive, and Tong Zhao, who was penniless after leaving her home, could not afford one. She had to rely on a regular computer for learning, with self-discipline being her only aid.
 

 
3. Channeling the Spirit of the Favored Concubine
 

 
Strictly speaking, this referred to her former self.
 

 
After many practice sessions, Tong Zhao had become proficient at switching between personas in reality. However, since she couldn't afford a holographic pod, her practice was still theoretical.
 

 
"When will I ever leave this crappy place…”
 

 
A woman lying on a single bed was doing leg lifts, aiming to make her thigh lines more pronounced and tight. Despite her plain face, the charm and delicacy in her eyes made her seem like she was reclining on a luxurious concubine’s chair. If anything about her attire or lifestyle wasn’t the best, she would sulk and act spoiled.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao herself had always been indifferent to her living conditions.
 

 
It wasn’t a matter of life or death, and she didn’t particularly enjoy seeking favors from men.
 

 
Her nature wasn’t suited for being a pampered and scheming concubine; it was left to the “Empress Consort” from her past experiences in palace intrigues to take on that role.
 

 
A week passed in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The holographic pods used for film shooting were more advanced and required going outside the home to the studio’s specialized pods.
 

 
Tong Zhao did her makeup, wore a simple black outfit, tied her hair into a high ponytail, and added a black bunny-ear headband as an accessory. She looked both cool and cute, making her aura hard to pin down.
 

 
After taking a cab to the film studio, she first registered her personal information at the front desk. As she walked through the building, she saw many attractive faces, mostly people hoping to find audition opportunities, perhaps stumbling upon a role that blended well with their "true self."
 

 
The corridor benches were filled with competitors, and the atmosphere was inevitably tense.
 

 
There was youthful vitality and ambition, but also disappointment and confusion. As Tong Zhao passed through the corridor with her light pink oversized sunglasses, she seemed to stand out in stark contrast.
 

 
Behind the vibrant-colored sunglasses, only her high-bridged nose, slightly upturned and full lips, and the elegant, tight line of her jaw could be seen. Her steps were light and lively, and even without seeing her expression, one could sense her composed and cheerful demeanor.
 

 
Such composure must mean she will perform well in the audition.
 

 
Those who saw her couldn't help but think with envy.
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao had experienced many grand scenes.
 

 
The last time her expression changed dramatically was when she saw nearly ten thousand zombies surrounding the city from atop a high wall.
 

 
Arriving on the thirty-first floor in the elevator, Tong Zhao was immediately taken by the stage manager to meet the director.
 

 
When the director saw Tong Zhao, both the assistant director and the actors with him had slightly grim expressions.
 

 
There was a reason for this. The last time Tong Zhao came for an audition, she had appeared disheveled and lost. Her “true self” at the audition was also dull and confused—beautiful, indeed, but lacking the aura of a great beauty. It was hard to believe she was truly an affluent young lady. Such a person should have been cut from the audition, but since the director insisted on using this connection, no one else could speak up.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was just a character to drive the plot, so a decent face was enough.
 

 
Young actors who only had looks were something the audience had grown accustomed to.
 

 
“Jian Shu.”
 

 
Before calling out to him, Tong Zhao removed her sunglasses and hung them around her neck, revealing a pair of bright eyes.
 

 
The director acknowledged her and signaled her to follow him to the side.
 

 
After assessing her face and noting her good complexion, he encouraged her, “It seems like you took my advice to heart. Having your own career is most important. Perform well later; don’t put too much pressure on yourself. The empress consort is just a decorative role—it’s quite easy to play well.”
 

 
The director had given similar pep talks to many others.
 

 
Nervousness was inevitable.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled upon hearing this.
 

 
Director Xu Zijiang had wanted to help her in his previous life, but she failed to seize the opportunity and ended up becoming a pitiful figure, much to her enemies' satisfaction. This time, she would not follow the same path. She nodded obediently, “Got it, Jian Shu. I will do my best.”
 

 
“Go ahead.”
 

 
Seeing her obedient, the director felt reassured but also guessed that her performance might not be outstanding.
 

 
After all, the empress consort was a character that had nothing to do with being obedient. In the script, she was a scheming, cunning beauty. However, since the actress was spirited and had a good face, her performance would surely be better than last time, making her suitable for the role of a supporting character.
 

 
“Ah,” the screenwriter sighed, “I’m just afraid that your ‘true self’ won’t attract Emperor Ming.”
 

 
Tong Zhao shrugged nonchalantly, “By the way, does the empress consort meet her end by being given death by Emperor Ming? Maybe you should worry about whether he’ll love me so much that he won’t want to kill me.”
 

 
“...Huh?”
 

 
Under the skeptical and somewhat contemptuous gazes of others, Tong Zhao, along with the other actors, lay down in the holographic shooting chamber.
 

 
Just before the equipment was activated, Tong Zhao activated her golden finger.
 

 
In the blink of an eye,
 

 
She transformed back into the palace legend who, in just three short years, rose from a courtesan to the position of empress consort!
# Chapter3
The director and staff monitored the shooting situation from the control room.
 

 
Holographic filming, similar to the quick-transmission themes in web novels, requires main actors to stay at the film studio throughout the shoot to maintain continuity. Unlike traditional films, which can be shot out of sequence, holographic filming must follow the chronological order of the script, with very few retakes. This is to minimize the changes in the performance of the "original self" based on real-life experiences, as closed shooting is designed to reduce these fluctuations.
 

 
Before closed shooting became popular, there was an actor who performed the role of a playboy well in the first half of the month. By mid-month, after being cheated on by his girlfriend, he was deeply affected and turned to Buddhism, refusing to flirt with women during the shoot. This forced a recast and reshoot. The original actor became a monk and occasionally took on roles requiring handsome monks.
 

 
He was known as the "Buddhist Idol," a rare example of a successful career transformation in the entertainment industry.
 

 
"Director, can she handle this? Last time, even Wen Zhuo couldn't bring her into character," the assistant director said with a worried expression.
 

 
Wen Zhuo, who played the male lead as Emperor Ming, was somewhat known for his acting skills. He was strong and well-suited for roles such as emperor and domineering CEO. Having debuted as a lead in idol dramas, he valued the opportunity to star in serious dramas. Although he had some reservations about the relationship with Tong Zhao, he still cooperated with the audition.
 

 
After the audition, his mood had somewhat deteriorated.
 

 
On the original timeline, due to Tong Zhao's poor performance during her first audition, the "original self" had a negative opinion of her, leading to a superficial portrayal of the Emperor's favor towards the concubine. It came across as a plastic relationship, resulting in a subpar effect.
 

 
After Wen Zhuo left the studio and watched the footage, he was deeply disheartened.
 

 
...
 

 
In the scene, the frail Empress was trying to promote her cousin to Emperor Ming during dinner.
 

 
In the story, this cousin was not close to the Empress.
 

 
She was selected from the Chen family by a family decision and promised to outshine the harem with her beauty.
 

 
"Legend of Emperor Ming" has a light-hearted tone, focusing on events not covered in official history, with interactions between the Emperor and two ministers, and the daily life in the harem as a subplot. The concubine, who is introduced later, represents a dark chapter during Emperor Ming's reign—a notorious beauty disaster that became a topic of interest for future generations.
 

 
The Emperor and Empress had a distant and discordant relationship. Emperor Ming disliked the Empress’s power-grabbing ways and showed a frosty demeanor when she tried to promote the new Chen family girl. Only after the girl showcased her gentle charm did the Emperor’s demeanor slowly soften.
 

 
This was the script.
 

 
But on the monitoring screen, after hearing this, Emperor Ming, played by Wen Zhuo, darkened his expression and immediately stood up to leave!
 

 
“What’s going on?” the assistant director asked in surprise.
 

 
“It seems that Wen Zhuo dislikes Tong Zhao too much, which is affecting his 'original self' behavior,” another person whispered.
 

 
So, instinctive films are not easily salvaged by repeated takes.
 

 
An actor's emotions can affect the behavior of their "original self."
 

 
“Should we pause? If the Emperor Ming refuses to even meet the concubine, the entire shoot will be impossible,” the assistant director inquired.
 

 
“Let’s wait a bit…”
 

 
Just as the director was sinking into deep concern, a delicate hand pulled aside the curtain, and Tong Zhao stepped forward to perform a grand bow. She had her hair in an elegant bun, and as she bowed her head, it was lower than usual, deliberately exposing a section of her snowy-white neck. Under the dim candlelight, it created a delicate, silky visual effect.
 

 
Men are visual creatures.
 

 
While the chest, waist, and legs are often associated with sexiness, Tong Zhao believed that the real erogenous zone is the mind. Sexiness is based on imagination; it can be a glimpse of the back of the neck, an exposed ankle, or a delicate silver bell on a slender wrist.
 

 
By exposing vulnerable areas and attracting the gaze of the predator, it evokes affection.
 

 
This is the experience summed up by the long-reigning favorite concubine in the harem.
 

 
Returning to conquer the Emperor with the experience of a top-ranked favored concubine is like using a dragon-slaying sword to deal with the deer in a beginner’s village.
 

 
As everyone inside and outside the scene was nervously waiting, Emperor Ming stopped in his tracks and looked at the young woman kneeling before him.
 

 
“Raise your head,” he commanded.
 

 
The staff outside the scene breathed a sigh of relief, and the director zoomed in to give Tong Zhao a close-up.
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, showing no sign of timidity before the emperor.
 

 
Her snow-white skin and pink dress made her face look like a peach blossom.
 

 
Her almond-shaped eyes were full of laughter, with a clean and sweet aura. Her bright, full lips were slightly curved, irresistibly alluring.
 

 
Every inch of her was beautiful, with no flaws to be found.
 

 
One couldn't help but wonder, hidden beneath the fabric, was every part was equally flawless?
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
The staff faced with this stunning beauty felt their hearts skip a beat. The young man in charge of monitoring equipment murmured, “Tong Zhao’s original self is more charming than the real person.” The assistant director nodded in surprise, “She was so lost in the first audition in front of the Emperor Ming, and now she performs so well in the second try. No wonder she’s the daughter of the legendary Tong actress.”
 

 
“Of course, I’ve always said Zhao Zhao has talent.” The director loved hearing praise for his star and became even more convinced that he hadn’t made a mistake in choosing her.
 

 
Let’s return to the scene.
 

 
Emperor Ming was so impressed that he helped Tong Zhao to her feet and allowed her to dine with him.
 

 
During the meal, Tong Zhao showed no signs of nervousness. She cast flirtatious glances at Emperor Ming, behaving like a perfect fox spirit. Emperor Ming, in turn, wore a gentle and amused expression, clearly captivated by this bold and beautiful young woman. “Just now, I was very fortunate…” He paused, feeling that this statement might be inappropriate.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not rush him and continued to gaze at him.
 

 
“I almost missed out on such a wonderful young lady.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the monitoring room, the staff had complex expressions.
 

 
The lead actor, Song Wanzhuo, was known for his upright character and had no rumors of scandal. Previously, as a leading man in idol dramas, he had always been portrayed as a seasoned professional, endearing himself to female fans. But now…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor completely entranced by beauty?
 

 
Although he performed his role excellently and the character of Emperor Ming was supposed to be like this, it seemed he had taken it too far!
 

 
“This,” the assistant director revealed the truth, “Wanzhuo has been drawn into the scene by Tong Zhao.”
 

 
……
 

 
The next part of the story shows that even though Emperor Ming knew everything was arranged by the Empress and the Chen family, he couldn’t resist favoring the Chen girl and officially designated her as Chen Mei. Since the scene needed to pass approval, no bed scenes were filmed. Instead, actors would have a brief memory of intimacy inserted by the equipment before switching scenes.
 

 
To enhance the likelihood of the Emperor Ming actor being captivated by the beauty, the scriptwriters cleverly set this vague memory to be extremely pleasurable.
 

 
After being designated as a beauty, Tong Zhao only had four scenes left.


 
These four scenes could be summarized in eight words:
 

 
Troublemaking and insatiable.
 

 
The assistant director smiled and said, “Brother Jian, you can finally rest easy.”
 

 
“There's no such thing as resting easy when shooting a primal film. I’m quite worried that Tong Zhao won’t perform well. Although the problematic content has long been written into the character’s mind, based on what I know of Tong Zhao, she’s a sweet and easy-going girl, not at all troublesome, very considerate, and caring about others' feelings…”
 

 
Just as the director finished speaking, the monitoring screen showed Tong Zhao, who had been excused from the next day’s audience with the Empress, comfortably refusing to see the Empress and instead lounging on the dragon bed. A nervous palace maid who had been assigned with her was anxiously discussing the implications, but Tong Zhao was nonchalantly relaxed, saying, “The Empress wants to use me to bear a child, but I won’t fulfill her wish. Once you enter the palace, you belong to the Emperor; let the Chen family face their own flood.”
 

 
The senior palace maid was even more worried after hearing this. However, after the secret guard reported back to the Emperor, Emperor Ming was very pleased.
 

 
Director: “What was the original range of the lines here?”
 

 
Screenwriter: “It was a complaint about how the Chen family treated her poorly and used her; it was meant to be quite tragic. I intended for the audience to sympathize with her, as even despicable people have their pitiable aspects.”
 

 
But Tong Zhao’s performance was not tragic at all.
 

 
She was extremely happy, living much better than she had in the Chen family.
 

 
When actors enter a holographic shoot, they are infused with character settings, memories, and certain behavioral directives. Since the role of the consort is a minor female character with limited detail, the setting is relatively thin, giving the actor a lot of leeway—she is a beauty who brings disaster but without a specific style, so she can be either a delicate green tea or a seductive red tea, as long as it aligns the main storyline in a general sense.
 

 
People noticed that Tong Zhao’s portrayal of the favored consort was, well, how to put it?
 

 
Too cute and naive.
 

 
Her interactions with Emperor Ming, full of coquettishness and cuteness, turned a historical drama into an idol drama with a pink bubble. Even the middle-aged assistant director was starting to believe in love again. It seemed she wasn’t constrained by her background setting at all, showing no fear of the Emperor. Every word and action hit the Emperor’s cute spots perfectly.
 

 
When interacting with the Emperor, Tong Zhao’s portrayal of Consort Chen includes a small gesture.
 

 
She likes to take the Emperor's large hand in hers, nestling her small face into it with a sense of devotion, like a little dog entirely devoted to him. Her bright eyes also look up at him with a moist gaze, making the usually domineering Emperor Ming soften completely.
 

 
This small gesture is memorable and leaves an impression on the audience.
 

 
“It’s troubling; Tong Zhao’s portrayal doesn’t seem bad at all,” said the lighting technician.
 

 
She is very favored, but she lacks the edge of a wicked woman.
 

 
“However, their interactions are quite cute. After the show airs, there might be a new ship.”
 

 
“Ha ha, forget it. How many female viewers don't have their own opinions on our show…”
 

 
The filming went smoothly, and the backstage atmosphere was good. At this moment, one person’s expression changed: “Zhang Meng, who plays the Empress, is planning to deal a deadly blow to Consort Chen. A colorless and tasteless poison has been mixed into today's meal and has already been served to Tong Zhao!”
 

 
How could this happen?
 

 
In the storyline, the Empress’s dissatisfaction with her cousin develops gradually.
 

 
Zhang Meng is also a rather steady actor.
 

 
Screenwriter: “It might be because Tong Zhao’s performance was too arrogant. She didn't even go to pay her respects and acted as if, having slept with the Emperor, she had no intention of doing anything for her family, which might have provoked the already anxious and ill Empress.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “And now she wants to take drastic measures?”
 

 
The screenwriter insisted, “Characters need to be exaggerated to have tension. If they’re ordinary and we don’t exaggerate the setting, the plot becomes bland!”
 

 
…
 

 
At this point, it was indeed quite exaggerated—Consort Chen hadn’t even become a favored consort yet and was about to be done away with.
 

 
The director made a quick decision: “Give the palace maid next to Tong Zhao a direct command to overturn that bowl of soup.”
 

 
A direct command involves controlling a character to perform a specific action. Afterward, the character will be puzzled by their own behavior, making it a tool for urgent situations and not suitable for repeated use as it can be obvious to the audience.
 

 
“There’s no time left!”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao had already picked up the delicate porcelain soup bowl.
 

 
She sniffed the soup with her dainty nose.
 

 
Although she could only smell the rich aroma of chicken soup, her brows furrowed, and her soft lips curled into a mocking smile:
 

 
“Is this it?”
# Chapter4
The "quick transmigration" had given Tong Zhao many abilities beyond the ordinary.
 

 
The cultivation techniques from the immortal world were useless in a plane without spiritual energy, but they were still effective for strengthening the body and enhancing appearance. In the martial arts world, Tong Zhao had come from an assassin family and had been immersed in countless toxins from a young age. She had an inexplicable sensitivity to poisons that could be fatal to the human body. Regardless of how diluted the poison was or how it was mixed into rich food, she could detect it just by smell.
 

 
Her personality had changed, but the knowledge she had acquired remained the same.
 

 
“I don’t want to drink this anymore; take it away,”
 

 
On-screen, Tong Zhao lay down on the couch, her flawless face showing a hint of arrogance. She instructed, “Don’t drink it secretly. If I don’t want something, no one else should touch it, even if it means throwing it away.”
 

 
Accustomed to her capricious behavior, the palace maid dared not disobey and could only regretfully pour the entire bowl of fine chicken soup away.
 

 
…
 

 
The screenwriter was surprised: “Is Tong Zhao just lucky?”
 

 
The director gave him a stern look.
 

 
However, the next development genuinely astonished the staff.
 

 
When the empress failed to gain favor, the younger cousin only became more cherished, gaining unprecedented popularity in the palace. Emperor Ming showed no signs of diminishing his interest in her. Initially intending to watch from the sidelines and let other high-ranking concubines deal with her, they each took turns trying to teach her a lesson. This was part of the script: to have her suffer and then transform from a scheming vixen into a black-hearted fox. However…
 

 
The character played by Tong Zhao, the Chen beauty, had never suffered once.
 

 
When it came to mentioning the Chen beauty's overbearing behavior, the lower-ranked concubines pointed out that she didn’t have the demeanor expected of her rank.
 

 
The emperor, still infatuated with Chen's beauty, decided to ask Tong Zhao for an explanation. Tong Zhao, pouting with a look that made the emperor not tired of her, said angrily, “No one at home treated me well. After entering the palace, only the emperor dotes on me. I’m not trying to show off. I just feel… I’m the one the emperor cherishes. The most distinguished man in the world treats me well; what could I possibly do wrong?”
 

 
She then muttered to herself, “I haven’t done anything wrong.”
 

 
When a man is enamored, everything a woman does seems right.
 

 
Tong Zhao aimed to establish a lasting impression during this period, gradually changing her character, providing continuous novelty, and achieving a sense of accomplishment. She started as a pampered child and then became a charming, confident favorite after her promotion.
 

 
Tong Zhao nestled in Emperor Ming’s embrace, letting him hold her slender waist.
 

 
"Your Majesty, they say my behavior doesn’t match my rank, but I don’t want to change. They think I’m unworthy, but I don’t care. Do you think I am worthy, Your Majesty?"
 

 
She lifted her face to look at Emperor Ming, and the director quickly zoomed in for a close-up.
 

 
The so-called "ironclad" straight man, Song Wanzhuo, saw the beauty's eyes turning red and felt sympathy. He wiped her tears and said something that left the staff stunned: "Why are you crying? I haven’t blamed you. Of course, you’re worthy. There’s no need to change."
 

 
?
 

 
Wanzhuo, you’re this good at handling emotions?
 

 
In the previous idol drama, you hurt the heroine’s feelings with your blunt handling of conflicts, but now you’re spouting sweet words in this palace drama?
 

 
This is actually not Song Wanzhuo’s fault.
 

 
In the previous idol drama, the heroine’s "true self" was a bright and lively little sun. Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" followed the script and fell for her. However, just like a forced situation is never sweet, apart from the plot, he wouldn’t have many sweet details for the heroine.
 

 
Who is the Consort Chen?
 

 
No matter how many emperors there are, she could win their favor just the same.
 

 
In the next day's plot, without Tong Zhao’s scenes, everyone thought her role was over. It was already quite an improvement that Song Wanzhuo’s "true self" could say sweet words to comfort others.
 

 
However, after the morning court session, Emperor Ming ordered that Consort Chen be promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen.
 

 
From Consort to Imperial Concubine—this was not just a promotion but a significant leap.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was known for his decisive action.
 

 
Does the favored consort not want to change her ways?
 

 
Fine, then it must be an issue with her rank. Change the rank, and it’s resolved.
 

 
As for why she became an Imperial Concubine?
 

 
Because the person behind the scenes making sour comments is a respected lady, which is just enough to push her down a rank.
 

 
After a round of analysis by the behind-the-scenes staff, everyone was deeply impressed.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Well, in the script, she was supposed to be promoted to Imperial Concubine in seven episodes."
 

 
Director: "That’s how instinctive movies work!"
 

 
Who could watch this and not say Tong Zhao’s true self is impressive?
 

 
The screenwriter, feeling helpless, just hoped that the following developments wouldn’t be too unexpected. Former writers often said sentimentally that characters in their writing developed their own ideas and that the writer merely put them on paper and couldn’t control them. Little did they know that years later, instinctive movies would make such worries a reality.
 

 
After being promoted to Imperial Concubine Chen, Tong Zhao became even more audacious.
 

 
When she was in a good mood, she would skip the morning greetings and lazily lie on the couch, enjoying a lie-in.
 

 
When she was in a bad mood, she would dress elaborately to go for the morning greetings. The imperial harem had strict dress codes with prohibited colors, but as everything she wore was a gift from the Emperor, accusing her of breaking the rules was tantamount to blaming the Emperor. Thus, the other concubines could only swallow their grievances, resenting her for her petty displays, only knowing how to pile on gold and jewels without any refined elegance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t care about them.
 

 
She wore the largest and finest jade and dared to wear a massive string of rubies. Such fine items would make anyone of lesser beauty look pale in comparison, but under the director’s close-up shots, the dazzlingly dressed Tong Zhao overshadowed the entire harem, truly making the six palaces' makeup appear colorless.
 

 
Although her behavior was inappropriate, she carried a kind of languid indifference in her gestures, as if no one in the world was worth her attention. She was like the faint scent of incense after it had burned out—fleeting, elusive, and ungraspable in its charm.
 

 
As the main plot of *Emperor Ming* developed to the tribute from a vassal state, Emperor Ming rewarded two important ministers. In the Qiang Kingdom, there was a tradition of comparing virtuous talents to pearls, and the largest East Sea pearl became a crucial plot item contested by the male second and third leads.
 

 
However...
 

 
Scene: The Imperial Study
 

 
Characters: Emperor Ming and Chief Steward Hai, who was about to report the list of tributes.
 

 
This was the original script.
 

 
But under the surveillance of the behind-the-scenes staff, Tong Zhao, dressed very plainly, barged in.
 

 
?
 

 
What are you doing here? Quite the scene-stealer.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t like the idea of adding extra charm, but he had specifically allowed Concubine Chen to come in.
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, understanding the situation, lowered his head. He guessed Concubine Chen had come to seek favor and make her presence known, which didn’t concern him.
 

 
The Emperor asked her what she wanted.
 

 
Tong Zhao, not bothering with formalities, didn’t grind ink but rather casually sat on the Emperor’s lap. Clearly acting out of bounds, she tilted her head and rested it on his broad shoulder, making one doubt whether she could walk independently at all. She spoke in a delicate and pretentious manner: “I haven’t been to the morning greetings these past few days.”
 

 
“I heard about it.”
 

 
“Who told you, Your Majesty?”
 

 
The Emperor replied coolly, “I figured it out myself.”
 

 
“It’s actually not my fault,” Tong Zhao, undeterred by his seemingly indifferent attitude, said sullenly. “I ran out of clothes to wear and don’t have new accessories to visit the other ladies.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai, who had been pretending to be invisible, was shocked.
 

 
How shameless can Concubine Chen be!
 

 
Since her favor began, a steady stream of rewards flowed into her Yanxi Palace.
 

 
Moreover, saying she wouldn’t go for morning greetings without new accessories—could such a thing be said by a consort? Isn’t she embarrassed?
 

 
Emperor Ming: “This is unreasonable.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Yes, yes, Your Majesty is wise!”
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her face, her red lips slightly curled, and her eyes moist: “I want to wear new clothes every time I appear before Your Majesty, to give you a pleasant surprise.”
 

 
Emperors come in many types.
 

 
Some prefer spirited young women who aren’t afraid of authority and speak their minds, while Emperor Ming’s preference was very clear: he was a top-notch male chauvinist, not particularly concerned with women's issues as long as they pleased him and acted coquettishly. He was very receptive to that.
 

 
Many women may disdain this, but it’s effective.
 

 
Emperor Ming didn’t comment on this flimsy excuse but simply looked at Chief Steward Hai and said, “Since she’s here, let’s see what tributes have come this year and choose some favorites.”
 

 
Chief Steward Hai: “Just like that? Your Majesty, please reconsider!”
 

 
As a result, the East Sea Pearl, which was a key plot item fought over by the two ministers, was picked by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Of course, she also took many excellent clothes, furs, and accessories, but this pearl was the best. It was listed first on the tribute list by the vassal state’s envoy, indicating it was truly a valuable item.
 

 
Screenwriter: "What?!"
 

 
Screenwriter: "I worked two all-nighters on this script, and now it’s just gone??? Song Wanzhuo, wake up!!"
 

 
Life truly is full of ups and downs.
 

 
He was so angry that he didn’t even call Song Wanzhuo by name anymore.
 

 
In instinctive films, there’s no going back. Although the plot changed, the director didn’t call for a reshoot. Considering the cost of each shoot, the screenwriter could only humbly pat his rapidly thinning hair and mutter, “When Song Wanzhuo comes out, I’m definitely going to grab him by the shoulders and shake him, make him wake up and stop favoring this little enchantress, Chen!”
 

 
The Assistant Director pointed out: “Just yesterday, you wanted Song Wanzhuo to be nicer to Tong Zhao in the film to make the favored consort role more convincing.”
 

 
The screenwriter was even more frustrated.
 

 
He truly didn’t expect Tong Zhao to become so captivating once she got into character.
 

 
……
 

 
After shooting five consecutive episodes, it was already late at night when the actors emerged from the chamber.
 

 
Exhausted, the actors followed medical advice to exercise in the specially provided gym to counteract the negative effects of long hours lying in the chamber. After sweating it out, they showered and went to bed. This was the routine for most actors, as shooting instinctive films was incredibly demanding.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was an exception.
 

 
After finishing his stretching exercises and his usual rigorous workout, he returned to his dorm room and requested a sample of the footage from the director.
 

 
When he left the chamber, the screenwriter had been casting a very subtle gaze at him.
 

 
That gaze was tinged with five parts disappointment, three parts reproach, and two parts sympathy, which made him uneasy, suggesting that there might have been a flaw in the TV show’s performance. The lead actor he was working with was usually reliable; the only potential issue was likely with Tong Zhao, the relationship client.
 

 
Sitting on his bed, Song Wanzhuo answered a concerned call from his manager: "Hmm, I’m still up. I’m watching the sample footage before going to bed."
 

 
The manager advised, "Be careful not to be too tired tomorrow. It’ll be the same whether you watch it or not; you’ll remember it by tomorrow anyway."
 

 
Appearing in instinctive films is like having a long dream. To avoid an overload of memories flooding into his brain upon waking, the long-term memories would gradually be sorted out.
 

 
The amount of memory from five episodes would be restored after a full night’s sleep.
 

 
"It’s fine, one episode is half an hour, so five episodes will be two and a half hours. I’ll watch it at double speed and finish by midnight, then go to bed. I’m worried about Tong Zhao’s performance and afraid I might not hide my opinions about her in the show. The screenwriter's gaze towards me was strange; I’m afraid I’ve lost my touch…"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo calculated it well.
 

 
However, after watching, as he gradually recalled the memories from the show, he was completely unable to sleep.
 

 
No wonder the screenwriter’s gaze was odd…
 

 
Who is this dog emperor? I don’t know him!
 

 
Author's Note:

# Chapter5
The male lead couldn’t sleep, but Tong Zhao slept very well.
 

 
The persona of Consort Chen was not yet satisfied and wanted to continue flirting with men. She had to suppress it forcefully—she feared that if she accidentally let Consort Chen out to play for a few days, she might come back to find a long list of backup admirers on her phone, and even jumping into the Yellow River wouldn’t cleanse her reputation.
 

 
Consort Chen giggled: “What’s to be afraid of? A woman’s success is inseparable from men.”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied: “That was your era. The modern world is different.”
 

 
Consort Chen huffed and ignored her.
 

 
In quick transmigration, conquering a world is almost like a lifetime. Personality splitting is a forced and helpless measure to protect oneself.
 

 
These personas are like one-sided and extreme versions of Tong Zhao.
 

 
One who can’t live without men and likes muscular men.
 

 
And another who is annoyed by males in general and can only slightly tolerate young and inexperienced ones.
 

 
Early in the morning, Tong Zhao enjoyed the special gym facilities, did basic muscle exercises, and then returned to her room to meditate and absorb the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy of this era is thin compared to the cultivation era, persistent practice will surely bring great benefits over time. Since it is an intangible wealth accumulated through her own blood and tears, she would make full use of it.
 

 
In the staff canteen, the director immediately spotted Tong Zhao.
 

 
He took his meal and naturally sat down in front of her. After exchanging a few pleasantries and noting that she looked well, he said, “The part you acted in will start airing tomorrow. My suggestion is not to look at the reviews. Both good and bad feedback can easily affect your subsequent performance… Also, try to avoid things that might destabilize your emotions. For instance, during his performance, Song Wanxue would cut off external communication and only let his manager relay important matters.”
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, looking particularly obedient.
 

 
In truth, she didn’t take it to heart.
 

 
Tong Zhao had long since grown indifferent to others' evaluations.
 

 
As for Consort Chen? She was most accustomed to being criticized and insulted. Whether it was the military officials cursing her during court sessions or the unsuccessful scholars writing sarcastic poetry, it didn’t affect her beauty. The scholars had long deciphered the secret code to gain favor with the emperor—flattering the consort with praise.
 

 
“Got it, thank you, Uncle Jian.”
 

 
“No need to be so polite…”
 

 
Before he could finish, Tong Zhao’s phone rang, with the caller ID flashing brightly: [Tong Zhenming].
 

 
Under the director’s disapproving gaze, Tong Zhao answered the call.
 

 
“Hello, Mr. Tong?”
 

 
The distant address successfully irritated Tong Zhenming, causing him to miss the cheerfulness in his daughter's tone.
 

 
“After all these years of raising you, you don’t even know how to address your father,” he sneered, unable to wait to remind her, “The first episode of *Star Selection Girls* reached platinum level in viewership.”
 

 
Viewership ratings are categorized into unique levels: black iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, emerald, and peak. Achieving the platinum level in the first episode indicates that the investment in pre-promotion has received reasonable market feedback. If the quality is maintained and effective marketing is applied, it might even surpass the diamond level.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Are you making a comeback in midlife?”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhenming was momentarily stumped by his daughter’s thought process: “Zhu Zhu was on that show; in the first episode, she had the most screen time, and the member discussion was also in the top three.”
 

 
He didn’t really understand the entertainment industry but wanted his daughter to know that his investment had paid off.
 

 
Tong Zhenming turned his attention to provoking his eldest daughter.
 

 
He knew that Tong Zhao was shooting an instinctive film and that it was best not to have severe emotional fluctuations during production. He also knew this could significantly unsettle her performance. But so what? Disobedient juniors should lose everything. He wanted his daughter to understand his authority and set some rules.
 

 
“Let me know when you’re in drag. I won’t watch any show you’re in.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s tone was flat but laced with sarcasm.
 

 
The director’s look of disapproval turned to surprise as he watched.
 

 
After ending the call, Tong Zhao immediately blocked her father’s number and explained to the director, “I’ll let him out when I’m in a better mood.”
 

 
Director: “I thought you’d yell at him.”
 

 
“Why should I scold him? Forget it. We're family by blood, and scolding feels too constrained. I know him well; bringing up my mother won't make him feel guilty. It’ll be more distressing for him if he’s caught off guard and has nowhere to vent his anger.”
 

 
As she spoke, Tong Zhao realized that what the director mentioned as “things that might destabilize your emotions” probably referred to *Star Selection Girls*. Uncle Zhi Jian was always meticulous, contrary to his rough exterior, and he cared for her, his junior, especially well. Even Tong Zhao couldn’t help but feel touched and allowed the director to comfort her for a while, appearing genuinely appreciative.
 

 
After finishing her meal, Tong Zhao left first.
 

 
The director, slowly savoring his tea, hadn’t enjoyed his quiet tea for long when Song Wanqing joined him.
 

 
“Director, are you very familiar with Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Song Wanqing, handsome with a strong jaw and bright eyes, had a very upright and attractive appearance.
 

 
He usually spoke in a particularly sunny and cheerful manner, making him a young star appealing to all ages.
 

 
The director, seeing him unusually hesitant and unsure, felt a bit curious: “An old friend’s daughter wanted to act, so I gave her a chance. It was uncomfortable during the audition, but the actual performance adjusted well, right?”
 

 
“Far more than that.”
 

 
Last night, watching the sample footage, Song Wanqing was so embarrassed he rolled around on the bed, tossing and turning.
 

 
He thought that was the worst of it.
 

 
Little did he know that the real torment was still to come.
 

 
After struggling through just five hours of sleep, he woke up to find himself haunted by memories from the drama, frozen in the pressures of the past dynasty. Each day, he was convinced to execute the rebel’s daughter, which occupied a third of the storyline. Despite the opposition, he not only promoted Chen to a noble consort but also followed her wishes, giving her the title of "Consort Chen," conferring unlimited honor upon her...
 

 
Damn, it's overwhelming!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao from a distance earlier, Song Wanqing almost couldn’t resist walking over to embrace his beloved precious.
 

 
He voiced his troubles.
 

 
“Every time I close my eyes, I see Tong Zhao’s face. She’s my consort, you know? Really. It might not seem like it from just watching the sample footage, but the Emperor is completely captivated by the consort. He even thinks about her during court sessions. So, it’s quite normal for me to think about her during my morning workout, right?”
 

 
It's common for actors in instinctive films to be influenced by their on-screen emotions, so large productions might have professional psychologists on standby. *The Legend of the Emperor* was assessed before filming, and since it didn’t include scenes with major real-world impacts (like crimes or arson), there were no psychologists prepared. Therefore, actors usually seek help from the director when they have concerns.
 

 
Since Song Wanqing was familiar with Director Xu, he confided all his feelings to him.
 

 
Song Wanqing was deeply troubled.
 

 
Yet, when he looked up, he saw Director Xu smiling happily.
 

 
Song Wanqing: “...Is it really okay to build happiness on my suffering?”
 

 
“Sorry,” Director Xu’s smile faded, but the underlying emotion remained cheerful, “Since you both have such great chemistry, the audience will definitely feel it. You’ll also be able to clear the stigma of emotionless performances in romantic dramas.”
 

 
Instinctive films in idol dramas are famously easy to shoot.
 

 
After all, with handsome men and beautiful women, it’s not hard to create some sparks once the character templates are implanted in their minds.
 

 
Moreover, in idol dramas, the characters are often flat, the plot straightforward, and everyone is either a rich second-generation heir or a star. As long as you have a good-looking face, even if the acting is a bit wooden, the audience is willing to accept it.
 

 
But despite the easy nature of the material, Song Wanqing just couldn’t perform well.
 

 
He was too picky about women on a subconscious level.
 

 
After adopting the character template, he could be in a romance within the drama, but his romantic scenes lacked emotion.
 

 
What could be portrayed as a passionate love, at first sight, ended up looking like an arranged marriage.
 

 
But opportunities in the entertainment industry are mysterious.
 

 
Song Wanqing encountered an excellent manager who established an “old guard” persona for him. With many female fans who were drawn to his type, it was easy to win them over. Later, he starred in a commercial drama without any romantic plot, and his performance was outstanding, solidifying his position.
 

 
But with this stigma, Song Wanqing shouldn’t expect to play many romantic roles.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Song Wanqing’s expression brightened a bit.
 

 
However, his pride remained intact: “How can previous mediocre actresses compare to my beloved consort?”
 

 
“You were just complaining about whether you could replace your beloved consort,” the director pointed out, but recalling Tong Zhao’s performance during the initial audition, he gave Song Wanqing an out: “Don’t dwell on that. Her screen time is limited in the future. If you’re genuinely interested, you should get her contact information soon.”
 

 
Though she’s a supporting character, the consort’s role isn’t significant.
 

 
She’ll soon be condemned to death by the Ming Emperor due to family troubles.
 

 
There are many cases of actors developing feelings from their roles in instinctive films. The director, seeing that Song Wanqing is relatively clean and upright in the industry, offered this advice.
 

 
“Let’s see. If you really end up falling for her, I’m afraid I might be reluctant to have her killed off in the show and would just disband the harem directly.”
 

 
Song Wanqing joked.
 

 
He was afraid of genuinely falling for her after a few more looks, which is why he hadn’t dared to approach her earlier.
 

 
The director laughed and changed the subject to discuss the relationship between the male lead and the second male character.
 

 
Meanwhile, after returning to her room, Tong Zhao went online to check the situation with “Star Selection Girls.”
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao lived under the shadow of her stepsister's fame and success for so long that her heart had been tempered to the point where, while she bit into a juicy, sweet apple, she could scroll through Weibo about Xu Zhu with complete composure. She mainly wanted to confirm if everything was developing just as it did before her time travel.
 

 
Xu Zhu now had her own official Weibo account.
 

 
@StarSelectionGirl-XuZhu
 

 
@XuZhuNationalFanClub
 

 
There was also a fan club in the name association, likely organized by the company to give new fans from the first episode a place to gather and gradually develop into true fans.
 

 
#StarSelectionGirlXuZhu#
 

 
#WhiteRichBeautyPrincessXuZhu#
 

 
#XuZhuDangerousXiaohan#
 

 
Tong Zhao clicked on the entries related to the "White Rich Beauty Princess" tag.
 

 
[ZhuZhu the little princess is so sweet and good, mama is a fan!]
 

 
[Wow, look at Xu Zhu's whole set of high-end luxury stuff in her dorm, I’m genuinely envious. Does Princess Xu Zhu still need a little sister?]
 

 
[Arranging Xu Zhu as an extravagant YXH, is the editor’s brain malfunctioning? The girl clearly grew up with the best things and doesn’t take them seriously, totally speechless.]
 

 
Well, just like in her previous life, Xu Zhu’s image was crafted by her agent as the pampered little princess.
 

 
The fact that she grew up with the best things was indeed true.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was little, she had so many good things that she couldn’t use them all, and her close friend Xu Zhu would often take them.
 

 
Her mother knew about this and specially bought a new set for Xu Zhu.
 

 
Both mother and daughter thought nothing of it since they were good friends.
 

 
Now, reflecting on it, Tong Zhao felt a bit nauseous and quickly sat down to recite a calming mantra, which made her feel much better. However, after reciting the mantra so often, it split off a part of her consciousness in the cultivation world. The usually silent personality of Lu Xianzhang rarely came out of hiding and said, “Those who betray me deserve to die.”
 

 
Every word seemed to emit a cold, sword-like aura.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled and replied, “Alright, this is a law-abiding society.”
 

 
The Empress Chen Gui fei chuckled, “Let Xu Zhu this bitch be smug for a few days. Once Zhao Zhao’s life is better than hers, it’ll be her turn to suffer.”
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, who couldn’t stand her flirtatious ways with men, went silent again.
 

 
Empress Chen Gui fei continued her assault, “I performed so well in the drama, making the Emperor fall head over heels for me, giving Zhao Zhao a big boost in the face. What use are you? If you’re useless, stay out of the way!”
 

 
When Tong Zhao first became Lu Xianzhang, she was being forced into marriage for her path to enlightenment.
 

 
The character’s deep-seated hatred of men meant that she lived a life of loneliness in that world.
 

 
After a moment of silence, Lu Xianzhang finally burst out with a powerful declaration:
 

 
“Give me a sword, and I’ll bloodily wash the Tong family clean!”
# Chapter6
Of course, Tong Zhao couldn’t really kill anyone.
 

 
She pacified Lu Xianzhang, then meditated and practiced for a while, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Although the spiritual energy in this world was extremely thin and immortality through cultivation was impossible, spending the same time on it was at least more effective than applying a hydrating face mask.
 

 
During this time, the episodes of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao began airing.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* maintained an average viewership rating at the tail end of the Diamond level, and online discussions were consistently high. For a newcomer, even a small guest role would be a coveted opportunity. The problem was that Song Wanxue’s reputation as a rigid, straight-laced man was well-known. Having him play an emperor enthralled by a favorite concubine? No problem; his majestic presence as the "Longevity Lord" was undeniable.
 

 
But having him portray an emperor who was lovesick and dazed by his favored concubine?
 

 
Fans could easily imagine him saying, “This is against the rules,” with his usual stern expression.
 

 
The romance between the Emperor and the Concubine was one of the few emotional storylines in the drama. Those who disliked Song Wanxue had been waiting for him to falter since the premiere, hoping for a glimmer of hope when the Concubine appeared.
 

 
Many were eagerly anticipating Song Wanxue's downfall.
 

 
Marketing accounts quickly joined in to stir the pot, and even Song Wanxue’s agent bought some promotional support to reinforce his image as an emotionless, straight-laced emperor—since he was bound to fail, it was better to extract some residual value from the collapse!
 

 
In the world of instinctive acting, who hasn’t had a failure?
 

 
As long as there’s a hook, there’s hype.
 

 
Indeed, with the buzz around #SongWanxueEmotionalScenes#, the latest episode featuring Tong Zhao performed well in the pre-release.
 

 
*The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* aired at 6 PM, and the holographic viewing halls were already packed with people.
 

 
For those who couldn’t afford a holographic helmet or viewing pod, traditional viewing methods were also available. True drama fans subscribed to both options, first enjoying the director's camera work and narrative from a distance, then immersing themselves in a 360-degree experience of the drama. Regardless of the visual method, audiences could watch while sending bullet comments or even tune in to live commentary and critiques from streamers who had set up separate rooms for fans.
 

 
Of course, some of the gifts and tips received had to be shared with the drama and the platform.
 

 
While the audience and onlookers eagerly awaited Song Wanxue's performance, the attention given to Tong Zhao, the newcomer, was relatively low. After all, she lacked fame and had no agent or company backing her, operating purely independently. Her stepsister Xu Zhu would have been delighted to see her fail, so naturally, she wouldn’t help her out. Moreover, it was suspected that the high-spirited Tong Zhao wouldn’t ride on her stepsister's coattails.
 

 
Tong Zhao indeed wasn’t inclined to do so.
 

 
She considered it unlucky.
 

 
Song Wanxue's fans were also in high spirits.
 

 
In this lively atmosphere, the latest episode of *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming* began.
 

 
The story starts with the impatient Emperor Ming being summoned to the Empress's palace. The Emperor and the Empress, who was obtained through political marriage, had a strained relationship. Viewers humorously claimed that Song Wanxue's performance was true to character, portraying the distant and emotionally detached relationship between the Emperor and Empress so well that everyone believed there was no affection between them. The Emperor was even somewhat annoyed with her, resenting her excessive ambition and focus on securing benefits for her family.
 

 
Sure enough, when the Empress mentioned introducing her younger sister, Emperor Ming slammed his teacup down on the table with a dark face.
 

 
Audience members who had seen the plot summary knew that the Emperor was about to experience a dramatic change of heart.
 

 
[The more he despises her now, the more he will favor her later.]
 

 
[Waiting for Emperor Ming's moment of true affection.]
 

 
[While you're waiting for true affection, remember who’s playing the Emperor—it's Song Wanxue! Does he really have the awareness of "cherishing and valuing" in his mind? Only the director’s forceful intervention will likely make him succeed in this role.]
 

 
This refers to an emergency measure rarely used on main characters because it can create irreparable problems. Some characters might feel like they’re possessed, leading to endless complications. Since it’s not an action genuinely motivated by the character, the scene can appear very awkward.
 

 
As the audience debated, a delicate white hand parted the curtain, and a young woman stepped out gracefully.
 

 
At this moment, she maintained the proper etiquette for a woman presenting herself to the Emperor, with her head bowed.
 

 
Even the audience could not see her face.
 

 
But the camera clearly conveyed the message:
 

 
She was a stunning beauty.
 

 
Moreover, Tong Zhao’s figure was also exceptional, successfully piquing the audience's curiosity.
 

 
[Ahhh, I can’t see, camera, move down a bit!]
 

 
[Someone get the photographer and drag him out for execution!]
 

 
[I’m so frustrated, why can’t I afford a holographic chamber? I really want to bend down to see the beauty QAQ]
 

 
Fortunately, it didn’t take long. With Emperor Ming’s command, “Raise your head,” the audience finally got to see the appearance of the Empress's younger sister.
 

 
She was incredibly beautiful.
 

 
Even under the close-up ultra-clear camera, no flaws could be found. She looked up at Emperor Ming, and guided by the camera, the audience felt as if everyone was being boldly gazed upon and flirted with by her, just like Emperor Ming.
 

 
The audience subconsciously held their breath.
 

 
There are many beautiful people in the entertainment industry, but those who become famous are often those whose beauty can take your breath away. If the first impression doesn’t shock the audience, they’ll have to rely on their talent to slowly build a fanbase. But with just one glance, some industry insiders could tell that this girl was exceptional.
 

 
Gazing at her with her enchanting eyes, hearts softened.
 

 
[………]
 

 
[…………I need all the information on this lady within three seconds!]
 

 
[Everyone shut up, I’m going to give a number now. In three minutes, I want to follow the Empress’s sister’s Weibo!]
 

 
It’s no wonder the audience was moved. For instinctive films, portraying certain character auras cannot rely on traditional acting alone; it requires relevant life experiences and emotional depth. What they were seeing at that moment was the real-life embodiment of Empress Chen, who had once laughed her way through palace intrigues and enjoyed enduring favor.
 

 
Unable to do anything else, but top in charming others.
 

 
The audience was first struck by the new character’s beauty, then quickly immersed themselves back into the story.
 

 
Then they saw the Emperor, who spoke with an unexpectedly gentle tone.
 

 
?
 

 
For a moment, the screen was filled with question marks.
 

 
Humans are creatures of double standards.
 

 
It was normal for the audience to be impressed, but seeing the Emperor’s genuine affection, especially in the scene of Song Wanxue’s transformation, the show’s effect was maximized.
 

 
[When we’re sending question marks, it’s not that we have a problem, but that the Emperor has a problem.]
 

 
[Is this really the serious, old-fashioned Song Wanxue? He’s breaking his character…]
 

 
[Damn, but the brother’s gentle expression is so handsome!]
 

 
Fortunately, instinctive films can't be fake; they're akin to a semi-reality show. Even though the audience was amazed, they knew Song Wanxue’s previous performances weren’t fake. It just seemed that this time, he had somehow surpassed himself and performed even better in the film.
 

 
It might be that having more experience with instinctive films has made him better adapted to his "true self."
 

 
This was a common speculation.
 

 
Regardless, Song Wanxue’s improvement was a positive boost for the overall quality of "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor," and the audience felt more confident in immersing themselves in the story. However, as they continued watching, they started to notice something strange.
 

 
Was it not that Song Wanxue had suddenly become more perceptive, but rather that this newcomer was incredibly charming?
 

 
The audience saw Tong Zhao acting cute and innocent in front of the Ming Emperor, always displaying naive beauty, and managing to make the Ming Emperor look like a lovesick fool.
 

 
Such a sweet girl!
 

 
No wonder the Ming Emperor liked her; who wouldn’t want to be an emperor when faced with such beauty?
 

 
The episode ended with the audience’s admiration.
 

 
The biggest beneficiaries were undoubtedly the actors playing the Ming Emperor and his cousin.
 

 
Riding the wave of Song Wanxue’s major transformation, Tong Zhao gained considerable attention. After this episode aired, her previously ignored actor’s profile suddenly received several signing offers. However, most of these were from small agencies and minor companies trying their luck. She glanced at them, found none of them appealing, and decided to consider her options further without rushing into signing a contract.
 

 
After Tong Zhao opened her verified actor's Weibo account, the director noticed that she had no posts at all. He urged her to quickly post something so that when the official drama account promoted her, some fans might transfer their affection from the character to her.
 

 
This suggestion was also the director’s way of taking care of her.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t immediately think of what to post.
 

 
After all, she was originally quite low-key and didn’t really use social media. Her skills were all developed during her fast-travel experiences and were managed by other personas. Posting on Weibo was something she could leave to Han Zhi, who had become a top celebrity.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Zhi Ge, help me post a selfie on Weibo.]
 

 
[Sure.]
 

 
In no time, a clear and pleasant male voice echoed in her mind.
 

 
Perhaps because the system saw her mission completion rate as too high, ordinary roles were no longer challenging.
 

 
Han Zhi was the only time she had played a male character.
 

 
Han Zhi was exceptionally good at taking selfies. He had practiced it, knowing how to adjust angles and apply filters, and was more skilled than many girls. The results were outstanding. The person was still recognizable, but the appearance naturally looked even better.
 

 
After posting the selfie, Han Zhi went back to being low-profile.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
The one who turned the Emperor into a lovesick fool is me [image]
 

 
The caption adopted the concubine’s persona, but the accompanying selfie was quite different.
 

 
Han Zhi wore a black suspender dress with a matching beret. She was slender, but her lines were not particularly soft. The shot from above highlighted her graceful jawline and collarbone, and the composition was impeccable. With a casual glance angled slightly upward, it electrified the viewers who stumbled upon it.
 

 
Damn.
 

 
In the drama, her eyes were like autumn waters, but off-screen, they were dazzlingly electric?
 

 
Typically, such an outstanding performance in the first role is often due to a genuine portrayal.
 

 
Viewers were prepared to see a sweet little fairy (fairy or enchantress) but instead saw a cool, androgynous beauty. She was beautiful and still the same person, but the feeling was different.
 

 
Fans witnessed the transformation of a small actress from O to A, from 0 to 1, and their curiosity was immediately piqued.
 

 
Unlike Xu Zhu, who flaunted her privileged background and actively promoted herself to fans, Tong Zhao posted her Weibo and then ignored the online buzz. She hadn't signed with a company or had a manager, so the resulting heat and public opinion were entirely generated by the audience.
 

 
Director Xu Zijian was paying attention and increasingly convinced that the goddess's daughter was indeed a promising talent.
 

 
He needed to find her a reliable manager soon...
 

 
At this moment, some were happy, and some were worried.
 

 
Xu Zhu, in her all-weather filming dormitory, decided to ignore her sister’s affairs, fearing that competitors might notice any signs. Since she had already done all she could in terms of mindset, and her sister was very good at pretending in public, she didn’t believe she could keep up the pretense in a role in a reality film.
 

 
She was confident, so she wasn’t the one worried.
 

 
The one worried was the Emperor.
 

 
In the drama, the Emperor only favored Consort Shen, visiting her palace every day, and even wished he could hold her while reviewing official documents.
 

 
Outside the drama, he couldn't even see her, and he really missed her face.
 

 
He was obsessed.
 

 
He thought he was going to fall.
 

 
After all, he did like the type of woman that Consort Shen represented—delicate, graceful, and beautifully dependent on a man.
 

 
If he truly fell for her, he planned to pursue her once filming ended.
 

 
This thought persisted until he saw the actress playing Consort Shen lifting weights in the gym.
 

 
?
 

 
Why did the beloved have a barbell in her hand?
# Chapter7
Song Wanzhuo didn’t come at the best time.
 

 
At the moment, Tong Zhao's primary personality had lent control to Han Zhi, who said he wanted to lift some weights.
 

 
Tong Zhao also disliked the fact that her current body lacked any muscle tone and only appeared slim because she couldn't gain weight. So, she agreed to Han Zhi's small request, as long as he didn't overdo it. She didn't want to be a soft, puffy person, nor did she want to become a muscular, buff woman.
 

 
So, what Song Wanzhuo saw was a consort with an indifferent expression and eyes that, despite their starry brightness, had a cold undertone.
 

 
While exercising, Han Zhi tied her long hair into a neat ponytail.
 

 
In short, nothing about her looked like Consort Shen from *The Chronicle of Emperor Ming*.
 

 
He blurted out, "Tong Zhao, you’re training in the strength area too?"
 

 
Hearing someone call her name, Tong Zhao looked up at Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The face was still the same face.
 

 
Her eyelashes were long and thick, like dark raven feathers, but the eyes beneath were cold, almost electric.
 

 
"Yes, Brother Wanzhuo.”
 

 
In the entertainment industry, seniority is important, and Tong Zhao was also used to calling everyone "brother" or "sister" when she met them, always observing proper etiquette. As soon as she spoke, Song Wanzhuo sensed something different again. "Brother Wanzhuo" and "Your Majesty" were both forms of respect, but in the show, when the consort called out "Your Majesty," it was always with a soft, delicate southern accent, while the actress’s own voice was slightly deeper, with every pronunciation crisp and clear.
 

 
When Song Wanzhuo looked at her now, he didn’t feel the slightest flutter in his heart.
 

 
His sixth sense told him this wasn't his consort!
 

 
But it was indeed the same person.
 

 
Suppressing his strange thoughts, Song Wanzhuo moved to the equipment next to Tong Zhao and started training, chatting with her intermittently.
 

 
“The audience says we have great chemistry together.”
 

 
“Brother Wanzhuo guided me well, so my subconscious easily got into character.”
 

 
“Hehe,” Song Wanzhuo liked being praised, but he also spoke frankly: “Your 'id' is quite distinct and charismatic. Your future on the stage is bright. Trust me, after this airs, when you audition for palace drama roles, even if it’s not the lead, you’ll at least snag a supporting role.”
 

 
Compared to traditional films, there are far fewer instances of unspoken rules or backdoor deals in instinct films now.
 

 
First, instinct films, when done well, are genuinely profitable and have especially high production costs.
 

 
Second, those who need to use backdoor connections generally have weaker “id” traits.
 

 
The roles left for these connected individuals are usually wealthy young ladies or gentlemen and seductively charming green tea characters, allowing them to perform in line with their true selves.
 

 
Or they would be cast in minor roles that, even if performed mediocrely, wouldn’t affect the overall situation.
 

 
Originally, the role of the Empress's cousin was intended to be a mediocre vase character.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s surprising performance brought the character to life.
 

 
"Thanks, brother," Tong Zhao smiled slightly, but her tone remained cool and detached. "But next time, I’d like to try a different type of role. I might not audition for palace dramas for a while."
 

 
Hearing this, Song Wanzhuo’s face was full of disapproval.
 

 
After all, instinct films are different from traditional ones. There's no need to rush to broaden one's acting range. Especially for newcomers, it’s important to stabilize their “id” traits; at least that way, they can thrive within a particular genre. However, after a second thought, he gave her some solid advice: “You could try playing a femme fatale or a player type in a modern drama. That would suit you perfectly.”
 

 
Tong Zhao still smiled lightly. "Brother Wanzhuo really understands."
 

 
This wasn’t Han Zhi pretending; it was because Tong Zhao's different personas were almost arguing with each other in her mind.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I should always be the one on stage."
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "I can make Zhao Zhao the most popular star among male fans! No man can resist me!"
 

 
Immortal Master Lu: "Only knowing how to seduce men has no future."
 

 
The personas accumulated from other worlds also wanted their chance to appear and leave a bold mark in instinct films. Naturally, they weren’t willing to see Tong Zhao always acting in palace dramas, which was the domain where Lady Chen, the Noble Consort, could slay the entire field.
 

 
Lady Chen, the Noble Consort: "Anyway, Zhao Zhao's first role was played by me. I’ve contributed to Zhao Zhao's success! I’ve flirted with men for Zhao Zhao! I want to see Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"But the role you played wasn’t the female lead."
 

 
The war correspondent sharply hit the sore spot of Lady Chen, the Noble Consort.
 

 
The noble consort, after all, only played a guest role.
 

 
Tong Zhao massaged her buzzing head.
 

 
While she was dealing with the chaos in her mind, Song Wanzhuo finished his workout and left feeling refreshed.
 

 
Half of his happiness came from the endorphins of exercise, and the other half from resolving his inner conflict.
 

 
He called his agent and started rambling: "Old Zeng, I've interacted with Tong Zhao. I realized my little dilemma about falling for her because the role was so superficial. It’s nonexistent. She’s not my beloved consort—she’s my good bro!"
 

 
The agent was utterly bewildered.
 

 
"A good bro? Are you sure?"
 

 
He had watched the show, and the charm the Empress’s cousin displayed was exactly Song Wanzhuo's type.
 

 
"Really, you haven’t met her in person. The more I talk to her, the more I feel like she’s a guy," Song Wanzhuo mused, refining his description. "Not the kind of rough tomboy, but rather, she’s very refined and good-looking. But when we talk and interact, I subconsciously treat her like a bro—a cool, handsome dude."
 

 
Something like this?
 

 
The agent was puzzled. "It's good you didn't develop feelings for her because of the role. Your fans want you to focus on your career and not get a girlfriend too soon."
 

 
...
 

 
Since Tong Zhao's scenes were interspersed within the main storyline, when Song Wanzhuo re-entered the pod, she was on a video call with the agent recommended by the director. The agent was a competent woman aged between 28 and 32, surnamed Chu, whom Tong Zhao respectfully called Sister Chu.
 

 
Sister Chu was quite friendly and didn’t put on airs or lay down strict rules just because Tong Zhao was a newcomer. She was straightforward about the contract. Tong Zhao didn't have many demands; she was willing to fight for resources with her own abilities. She just wanted someone to help her arrange variety show appearances and promotions.
 

 
They discussed the contract details, and after reaching a consensus, they signed it.
 

 
One of the reasons things went so smoothly was that Tong Zhao remembered Sister Chu from her past life as quite capable, personally leading a top-tier male star to fame, without any particularly outrageous scandals. However, Sister Chu was the type who achieved success later in her career; in the original timeline, it would be a few more years before she met her benefactor.
 

 
After signing the contract, Sister Chu assured her that she would guide her well.
 

 
“I trust you,” Tong Zhao replied with a smile.
 

 
She wasn't interested in clinging to powerful connections ahead of time. Instead, she wanted to become someone others would want to cling to.
 

 
For five consecutive episodes, the parts featuring Tong Zhao were particularly popular—this girl was just too interesting.
 

 
At first, people thought she was a master manipulator, a "green tea" expert. Typically, when an ordinary person enters the palace, they would be cautious at first, endure the scolding of seniors, and only take revenge after establishing themselves. But not Chen Pin. Her way of gaining a foothold was to use the other concubines’ bullying against her to cry to the Emperor.
 

 
When ordinary concubines played the victim, it was, "They're so vicious; I’m so pitiful."
 

 
When Chen Pin played the victim, it was, "They’re so vicious; Your Majesty is so pitiful."
 

 
The audience knew her character was set up to be a bad woman, so watching her act cute and play innocent in the male lead's arms was highly entertaining and had a great comedic effect. Some viewers, with time on their hands, clipped her coquettish scenes into GIFs and memes, finding her expressions to be quite theatrical. Even without sound, she was adorably charming, perfect for "cute" reaction memes.
 

 
Discussion threads related to "The Legend of Emperor Ming" sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, drawing in a wave of female viewers who came to learn the art of "green tea."
 

 
However, after she established herself: Chen Pin stopped being "green tea."
 

 
She became "black tea," openly mocking and humiliating other concubines, becoming the little tyrant of the harem. Li Fei, who refused to believe this, relied on her higher rank to cripple a cat that Chen Pin was raising. Ostensibly, it was an accident, and she sent her head maid to deliver the dying, crippled kitten back to Chen Pin’s palace with a fake apology.
 

 
Li Fei wanted to disgust and humiliate her, and she also intended to scare her a bit.
 

 
It's just a cat; what could Chen Pin possibly do?
 

 
Unexpectedly, Chen Pin turned hostile on the spot.
 

 
She immediately ordered the young eunuch, who was skilled in martial arts and bestowed upon her by Emperor Ming, to pin down the two palace maids who admitted to crippling the cat and were arrogant and overbearing. She demanded that they receive the same punishment as the cat—broken legs. Since senior maids represent the dignity of their masters, Li Fei was furious and stormed into Chen Pin's palace to make trouble, only to find Emperor Ming already there.
 

 
Before Li Fei could cry and play the victim, the Dog Emperor provided a solution: "They're just two palace maids. Drag them out and beat them to death to settle it."
 

 
The maids' hearts sank.
 

 
"Beating them to death is such a waste," Chen Pin said, leaning on Emperor Ming's arm in front of Li Fei. She leaned so close that half of her soft body was almost resting on him, making Li Fei inwardly curse her as a vixen. "The two maids said Snowball is just an animal, thinking I wouldn't hold it against them. So, let's let them live and die like animals. When Snowball’s injuries heal, then they can recover too."
 

 
Humans can endure much more than a small cat.
 

 
In other words, even if these two maids had strong enough lives not to die, as long as the cat wasn’t fully healed, they’d be beaten to the same extent as her Snowball.
 

 
Too cruel.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
At the same time, this approach matched the newcomer's "true self" perfectly—strong and fierce. She portrayed the scorpion-like beauty with vivid realism. If her "true self" were more mediocre, one could hardly imagine such a method of retaliation.
 

 
Emperor Ming agreed, ordering others to pick two new palace maids for Li Fei, while leaving the current two for Chen Pin to "play" with.
 

 
Chen Pin still felt it wasn't enough. That night, she whispered in the Emperor’s ear on the pillow, successfully making him view Li Fei in a much worse light. The next day, her status was demoted from Li Fei to Li Pin—oh no, Yu Pin.
 

 
As for whether it was the "Yu" meaning "surplus" or the "Yu" meaning "a fish that’s destined to be eaten by a cat," who could say?
 

 
Yu Pin thanked the Emperor for the decree and then vomited blood in anger.
 

 
...
 

 
[Too ruthless, too ruthless—is this the boldness of a favored concubine?]
 

 
[Was that necessary? It’s just a cat.]
 

 
[To the commenter above, animal cruelty has been a crime for five years now. Also, from a plot perspective, Li Fei's actions were a clear provocation and humiliation of Chen Pin. In the face of imperial power, there really is no difference between a palace maid and a cat. Just enjoy the show and don’t overthink it.]
 

 
[You can only enjoy this kind of thing in movies and shows.]
 

 
[To those overanalyzing, hush! I love watching palace dramas where the villainous female lead crushes everyone! Go, go, go!]
 

 
While this controversial plot stirred debates in the discussion forums, the big data evaluations rated it as quite satisfying.
 

 
Viewers empathized with Tong Zhao’s character. If their pet had been crippled, they would be angry and upset too.
 

 
Slapping back in revenge felt good. Simple as that.
 

 
And when viewers feel satisfied, they will generously reward the show with high ratings and buzz.
 

 
It's so exhilarating!
 

 
They want to keep feeling this thrill!
 

 
※
 

 
*The Chronicles of Emperor Ming* is not a palace intrigue drama, so an antagonist can't survive until the very end.
 

 
When Tong Zhao re-entered the pod, she was filming the scenes where the imperial concubine's fortune takes a downturn.
 

 
As an external relative to the royal family, the Chen family's ambitions had always been high.
 

 
With the Empress unable to bear a legitimate son, they wanted to send another Chen woman into the palace. After the Empress, driven by sheer determination, finally gave birth to a young son, the Chen family even entertained thoughts of rebellion.
 

 
Of course, this rebellion was unsuccessful and served as a major trial for the protagonist, Emperor Ming—one of the main plotlines of the show.
 

 
A major plotline cannot go wrong, so under the tense supervision of the crew, the Chen family embarked on their rebellion with some minor scares but no major mishaps. Predictably, they were lured out and completely taken down by Emperor Ming, who had foreseen the plot all along. The whole family ended up in prison, and the Empress requested to be deposed.
 

 
Being another daughter of the Chen family, Tong Zhao's character became the target of everyone's ire.
 

 
The other concubines in the harem watched with snide comments, eager to see her downfall.
 

 
The crime committed by the Chen family this time was too severe. Her father was one of the main culprits, guilty beyond pardon. The Empress, in the end, was only spared the disgrace by being granted white silk for a dignified end.
 

 
As Tong Zhao's character was nearing her exit, the director was very satisfied: "I'm sure many viewers who watch this show will remember her vividly."
 

 
A distinctive "true self" is very well-received.
 

 
Thinking about fulfilling the wish entrusted by the goddess, the director felt particularly gratified.
 

 
Concubine De, the first to kick someone when they're down, pretended to express regret in front of Emperor Ming, saying that the harem would become lonely without the imperial concubine.
 

 
Emperor Ming frowned:
 

 
"What nonsense are you talking about? I never intended to have her executed."
# Chapter8
Concubine De was dumbfounded.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes staff were also stunned.
 

 
They hadn't considered the possibility that Emperor Ming might not want to have Tong Zhao killed. When "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" cast Song Wanzhuo, it was because his "true self" was such a perfect fit for the role. Emperor Ming would not be foolish on major issues; the Chen family had committed a grave crime, and how could the public be satisfied if the Chen clan was not punished?
 

 
The Empress received only a white silk, so what could the Imperial Concubine expect?
 

 
Moreover, many of the palace concubines and their factions were hoping for her death to make room for newcomers, and the previous dynasty had put a lot of pressure on Emperor Ming.
 

 
The scriptwriter had written the role of this female character as merely a tool to allow the protagonist to transform once more into a ruthless ruler.
 

 
Assistant Director: "Uh, this..."
 

 
Since, aside from the main character and the major stars who could negotiate a share of the profits, the performance fees were generally agreed upon in advance—paying per episode, with budgets not easily altered—the plot's outcome was set firmly. If the script called for the character to die by the seventh episode, the eighth episode would only show a memorial portrait if she appeared at all.
 

 
Everyone looked at each other in confusion.
 

 
The lighting technician cautiously suggested, "If you can't have her die, maybe add a temporary script change and have Tong Zhao die of illness instead?"
 

 
This was also a solution, though it was somewhat contrived.
 

 
"Let's wait and see for a while," said the director, and the group stopped discussing, secretly hoping no more issues would arise.
 

 
……
 

 
Emperor Ming really didn't want to kill her.
 

 
Since "The Chronicles of Emperor Ming" had many serious scenes, Tong Zhao's role was not major. However, if the scenes of their interactions were edited separately, anyone with a bit of experience could see how sweet and affectionate their relationship was. The Imperial Concubine knew exactly how to win Emperor Ming's favor, always managing to calm him down. They had only known each other for a year, still within the honeymoon period, and he was extremely reluctant.
 

 
This was actually something Tong Zhao had anticipated before getting into character.
 

 
She had read the script, knew how her character would die, and expected that the Emperor would be reluctant to kill her.
 

 
After all, "Concubine Chen" was a persona she created with great effort in the ancient palace. If she couldn’t even win over an emperor, she couldn’t claim to be a beloved concubine and might as well find another field to farm.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was confident and calm before stepping into character.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Because "Concubine Chen's" mission was to become the Emperor's idealized memory after his death, once her favorability reached 100, she would find a suitable way to die. This self-destructive tendency was deeply buried in her memory, like a code waiting to be triggered at the right moment.
 

 
……
 

 
In the palace.
 

 
Concubine Chen not only did not lower her status but instead dressed exquisitely every day, making the other concubines envious of her regal appearance.
 

 
Even with her eyes narrowed like a rabbit's, it was useless; the Emperor loved her regardless.
 

 
"Yuzhi, I've been dreaming lately about the things my sister said to me before her death."
 

 
The senior maid beside Concubine Chen quickly knelt and said reassuringly, "Your Majesty, those were just the ramblings of someone who knew they had no way to deal with you. If she really had any power over you, it wouldn't have ended up like this."
 

 
Concubine Chen's palace was tightly controlled, and her behavior was so arrogant that even her servants who had followed her into the palace had picked up some of her haughty attitude. Even after death, in Yuzhi's words, she was just a blabbering fool who wanted to curse the esteemed Concubine Chen!
 

 
Before the white silk was placed, the Empress cursed Concubine Chen fiercely: "Unfaithful, unfilial, and treacherous seductress, how long can you keep the Emperor's favor with your looks? I’ll be waiting for you down there…" She sneered bitterly, "Waiting for you to fall from favor and into ruin…”
 

 
The Empress resented the rebellious concubine, resented the Emperor's indifference, and also resented the Chen family's ambition and disregard for her situation in the palace.
 

 
"Your Majesty, don’t be afraid. Should I ask the Imperial Physician for a calming remedy?"
 

 
"Afraid of her?" Concubine Chen laughed dismissively. "I’ve never been afraid since entering the palace. If I wasn’t afraid while I was alive, I certainly wouldn’t be afraid after death. As for martial skills, my sister is no match for me."
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
She had originally been just a side branch of the Chen family, unlike her elder sister who was destined to become a consort. She had climbed trees as a child and later learned to dance to win the Emperor's favor. Despite her slender limbs, she was strong, and even in the afterlife, Concubine Chen was confident she could overpower her sister.
 

 
Concubine Chen closed her eyes, and her smile faded slightly. "I had only hoped to fight for a lifetime."
 

 
The afternoon sunlight streamed through the paper windows and fell on her skin, which was as delicate as white jade, making her appear as if she was glowing.
 

 
A subplot was added to the main story: Concubine Chen had someone bring her some poison. The palace maids and eunuchs thought nothing of it. Their mistress had always been known for her pranks, like sprinkling itching powder, and even if she did manage to kill someone, what did it matter? However, they had never seen her cause a miscarriage or the death of a prince.
 

 
It seemed that the Empress's concerns were never about offspring.
 

 
Returning to the previous dynasty.
 

 
The Chen family's rebellion and the threat from an external enemy ran parallel to each other. To gain the support of another prominent clan, the Emperor had to execute the troublemaker. After the Emperor's furious reaction, he realized for the first time that being an Emperor wasn't as free and easy as he had thought. This further solidified his resolve to consolidate all power back into his own hands with the help of his trusted aides, the second and third male leads.
 

 
Although they had never met, the second and third male leads despised Concubine Chen, believing she was the cause of their problems. One scene depicted them discussing Concubine Chen, lamenting that she was indeed just an ignorant woman who refused to die for the greater good.
 

 
The director pondered, "These lines will definitely anger female viewers. Concubine Chen is a genuine scapegoat. She spends her days enjoying herself with palace maids, playing with cats and dogs, and at most, bullying other consorts. Why should she be punished with death?"
 

 
A staff member commented, "Well, that's male subconsciousness for you. It's not too extreme."
 

 
Previously, there had been public outcry over a middle-aged male actor's assertion that cheating was not a crime and that wives should be understanding. Despite the backlash, he garnered loyal support from a segment of male viewers and continued to do well.
 

 
In the study, the Emperor and the male leads were discussing state affairs when the chief steward, trembling, entered to inform the Emperor that Concubine Chen had requested an audience. She claimed that, although she was unworthy of the Emperor's favor, she had practiced a new dance and hoped to see His Majesty smile.
 

 
Concubine Chen's tone was mocking. The implication was that if the Emperor did not attend, it meant she was unworthy, and she would be heartbroken.
 

 
The faces of the two officials immediately darkened.
 

 
Screenwriter: “…”
 

 
Screenwriter: “I spent all night thinking about the plot in the Emperor’s study.”
 

 
Assistant Director: “My condolences.”
 

 
At this point, everyone on the backstage was wondering when Concubine Chen would die.
 

 
The second and third male leads were also thinking the same thing.
 

 
They wished they could personally shove a poisoned meal into her mouth.
 

 
At this moment, the more arrogant second male lead suggested that they should go together, enjoying the dance while discussing affairs, so as not to delay official matters. The third male lead immediately gave him a look, signaling him not to be too excessive. Even though their relationship was like that of close comrades, this was still too disrespectful.
 

 
The Emperor's expression remained calm, showing no sign of joy or anger. He simply asked Steward Hai to check if Concubine Chen would agree to allow the two ministers to enjoy the performance together.
 

 
Concubine Chen agreed.
 

 
The intention to humiliate the troublemaker was clear, but no one expected the woman to be so thick-skinned.
 

 
Since the ministers were going, it was naturally not appropriate to hold the event in Concubine Chen's quarters.
 

 
The palace had many places, so a suitable garden at the boundary was chosen, and a stage was set up.
 

 
“New dance? Where’s the new dance? We didn’t give her a new dance template,” the template designer suddenly realized the key issue. Some roles required unique skills to be demonstrated, and if the actor couldn’t perform them, a template or MOD had to be used. “Does Tong Zhao know how to dance?”
 

 
Everyone turned to the only person who knew Tong Zhao.
 

 
The director hesitated, “I think she studied ballet? I’ve seen her perform Swan Lake before.”
 

 
...
 

 
On-screen, Concubine Chen appeared gracefully in a water-red dance outfit.
 

 
The three men in the audience instinctively straightened their backs.
 

 
She was too beautiful.
 

 
Her face, shaped like an egg, was adorned with vibrant makeup. Her almond-shaped eyes, with a hint of rosy hue at the corners, resembled a celestial maiden descending from the heavens. Unlike a goddess who was aloof and untouchable, she was alluring in a way that made one want to intrude.
 

 
The Emperor showed a hint of regret on his face.
 

 
He shouldn’t have let these two men enjoy the performance to prove how exceptional his beloved concubine was.
 

 
However, there was no time for him to regret it, as Concubine Chen had already begun dancing.
 

 
It was indeed a new dance.
 

 
None of the three had seen it before, nor had the template designer. It was not Swan Lake.
 

 
It was a delicate dance from another realm, performed by Concubine Chen before the Emperor, featuring delicate silver bells on her hands and ankles. The jingling of the bells created a crisp sound that cut through the seductive atmosphere with a tinkle of gold and jade.
 

 
“... If this segment is cut out on its own, Tong Zhao will definitely become popular.”
 

 
Someone muttered in a daze.
 

 
“It’s not a matter of whether she will become popular or not; the Emperor truly won’t have the heart to let her die,” the director sighed. “Let’s arrange for an urgent illness plotline.”
 

 
Concubine Chen had boasted that no man could resist her.
 

 
At that moment, everyone who saw her felt her bewitching charm. She was exquisitely beautiful, evoking a sense of wonder about what she had endured. It was as if she had crushed herself and fiercely burned away the remaining fragrance, yet it still lingered with a bittersweet allure that left hearts entranced.
 

 
After the dance, Concubine Chen deeply bowed, as if about to perform a kneeling ritual.
 

 
The Emperor suddenly stood up, hurried forward to help her, and gently lifted her chin. He saw a pale, exquisitely beautiful face hidden beneath the makeup. She parted her lips and said, "Your Majesty..." before spitting out a small amount of blood.
 

 
The Emperor was both shocked and anxious, immediately sending for the imperial physician.
 

 
"Please, Your Majesty, don’t make things difficult for yourself," Concubine Chen's eyes shone brightly, surpassing even the fireworks at the coronation ceremony: "I want you to always remember me, remember that I am your Wanwan, and love me..."
 

 
Her voice weakened, and upon seeing the Emperor’s face, she showed a pained expression, shaking her head and sighing: "Forget me, just forget me."
 

 
The poison was prepared for her.
 

 
In the parting love, there was no truth. The underlying message of “I don’t want to delay you” was “Don’t delay me, just leave quickly.”
 

 
“Forget me” was actually “You must remember me.”
 

 
She wanted him to never again hear the sound of jingling bells.
 

 
In her life, Concubine Chen had loved only two people.
 

 
One was her sister, the empress, who was a model for all women in the family, and who had urged her to enter the palace to bear children.
 

 
The other was herself.
 

 
...
 

 
The backstage after the shoot was silent.
 

 
The screenwriter trembled, "Um, I need to explain to the audience that this scene with the knife wasn’t written by me. Will they believe it?"
# Chapter9
Huff!
 

 
Tong Zhao opened her eyes, sat up straight in the filming room, and let out a long sigh.
 

 
The other actors were still in the room with their eyes closed.
 

 
Only actors who died in the scene would wake up early. Everything was still going according to her plan; the character of Shen Guifei had died.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at Song Wanzhuo in the adjacent room.
 

 
A line of transparent liquid slowly slid from the corner of his eye.
 

 
Although her memory hadn’t fully returned, it seemed Shen Guifei's death was quite impactful.
 

 
There was a glass window through which she could see the backstage of the shoot. Tong Zhao looked up and waved to the monitoring window, signaling that she was in good condition and would be out soon. The director smiled at her, but the screenwriter’s gaze was rather subtle.
 

 
Tong Zhao walked out and took a moment backstage to thank everyone.
 

 
The filming style of "Instinct" was quite different from before; it didn’t build deep connections with the crew through each scene. After all, the actors spent most of their time in another “world,” and since she was just a guest star with her character’s role done, it was time for her to leave.
 

 
"Let's have a chance to work together next time."
 

 
"You'll remember later, I didn’t expect you to dance so well, Zhao Zhao!"
 

 
"Enough with the pleasantries, let’s add each other on WeChat first!"
 

 
The comment jolted everyone awake.
 

 
People quickly pulled out their QR codes to scan, and within minutes, Tong Zhao had added a lot of new contacts, all categorized under [Work] in her list.
 

 
The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
Firstly, there were no conflicts of interest; secondly, they thought she performed exceptionally well and was bound to become popular soon. Even if they couldn’t benefit from her immediately, having a future big star in their contact list was advantageous.
 

 
As she mechanically added new friends, Tong Zhao recalled how she had quietly left the set of "The Tale of Emperor Ming" in her previous life, fading away without making a sound. Only Director Jian Shu sighed and gave her work advice.
 

 
The same place, different treatment.
 

 
Tong Zhao did not lament the fickleness of human nature; she was simply satisfied that the changes she made were the right ones.
 

 
---
 

 
"The Tale of Emperor Ming" is still airing.
 

 
But besides the main plot, a mysterious force has quietly emerged and become a striking feature in the viewer comments—Ming Chen and Chen Ming shippers.
 

 
A male and a female, but why is there a sequence?
 

 
Fans of the former shipper are all about the handsome emperor and his delicate consort.
 

 
Fans of the latter are all about the domineering beauty and the befuddled, lovesick emperor she has ensnared.
 

 
Among them, Song Wanzhuo's fans are the most quickly captivated.
 

 
They worry, “Will my brother really fall in love with her?”, while also thinking, “Ah, but the domineering and affectionate brother is so charming!” They found that viewing from the perspective of Consort Chen made the experience so much better, especially delightful!
 

 
What about the main plot?
 

 
This segment of the audience turned on double speed for the main plot and only returned to normal speed when Consort Chen appeared. In the script’s setting, this romantic subplot was just sugary fluff mixed in with the main course. But now, it’s like the audience kicked the whole banquet over and made the pastries the main course—sweet, sweet, sweet.
 

 
[Life is already so bitter; I just want to eat sweets.]
 

 
[It’s not just about the sweetness; I love watching Consort Chen slap faces online. Seeing her flaunt her power is so much fun! Since she’s not the main character, I worried she might suffer, but it seems Tong Zhao’s “true self” is quite domineering.]
 

 
[Not just domineering!]
 

 
---
 

 
This made the audience who were originally focused on the serious plot of **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** feel a bit uneasy.
 

 
The drama was overshadowed by the side plot.
 

 
As a result, apart from discussing the sweet moments and the plot, the comment section of the viewer's bullet chat started to fill with sour comments, especially from female viewers.
 

 
[If you want to enjoy sugary moments, go watch a romance drama! This is a historical drama; some female viewers should just back off and stop making me say unpleasant things.]
 

 
[Actually, I’ve always thought it’s good that the audience gender ratio for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is somewhat skewed, since they don't understand it anyway :D]
 

 
Anyone surfing the internet has some sense of the underlying hostility.
 

 
The targeted groups weren’t going to take it lying down, so they began to retaliate:
 

 
[No way, no way. Could there really be people who think women don’t deserve to watch historical dramas?]
 

 
[It’s quite strange. This year, the gender ratio of viewers for **"The Tale of Emperor Ming"** is almost even. Do you think TV dramas don’t want female viewers because they’re making too much money? Are you trying to sabotage your own show? Does your master know?]
 

 
The argument ironically brought another wave of attention to the drama. Oddly, even though the debate was fierce, the criticism wasn’t directed at Tong Zhao or Consort Chen.
 

 
By the next day, the official data came out and revealed the truth.
 

 
In the era of big data, each viewer's consent before watching a show has already defaulted to data collection. The producers pay close attention to who in the show is the key to retaining viewers. With data analysis, nothing escapes scrutiny—whether a particular plot was frequently fast-forwarded or which scenes were watched repeatedly.
 

 
To get accurate numbers, the official system has a data fraud detection mechanism. Fans' mechanical repeat viewings are not counted, so the released data is the genuine version and cannot be deceived.
 

 
When the data came out, the people who had been arguing were stunned.
 

 
The ratio of male to female viewers repeatedly watching Consort Chen’s scenes was 7:3.
 

 
Male 7, Female 3.
 

 
[Oh wow…]
 

 
[Alright, there’s no difference between the dog emperor and the dog man.]
 

 
[As long as it’s a man’s show, whether in the drama or outside, does Consort Chen’s sister slay the whole scene? I almost vomited from laughing so hard at last night’s leftovers.]
 

 
Right after this, Tong Zhao thought the long-dead system had suddenly come back to life.
 

 
And it came back with two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s passive skill “Favorite Consort Aura”: Male viewers will view your work through a filter because no man can resist the charm of Consort Chen.]
 

 
[Congratulations, Host, for activating Consort Chen’s active skill “Overwhelming Beauty”: No matter the angle or attire, Consort Chen is always the most stunning! Activation Condition - At least three women present.]
 

 
……
 

 
They were all very useful, making their way to becoming major beauties in the film industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [System, am I about to undertake another mission? Or is it something else?]
 

 
System: [The host has completed all tasks in the small worlds. The system will no longer require the host to solve any tasks with annihilation as a punishment.]
 

 
After the explanation, the system fell silent.
 

 
Tong Zhao breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
After all, this is her life, and she wants to live it according to her own wishes.
 

 
Consort Chen was delightfully wicked; not only had she kickstarted Zhao Zhao’s entertainment career, but she had also activated useful skills. She was practically the most contributive one at home: [In the past, Zhao Zhao, you should have promoted me.]
 

 
Lu Xianchang coolly responded: [The consort has been promoted as much as possible. Just kill her.]
 

 
※
 

 
"Chronicles of the Ming Emperor" became increasingly popular, with viewership numbers rising.
 

 
Data showed that the character of Consort Chen was exceptionally likable, and the audience wanted to see Tong Zhao!
 

 
However, rumors spread that someone on set saw Tong Zhao leaving in a cab.
 

 
In other words, Consort Chen had met her end.
 

 
How could this be!
 

 
The fans firmly refused to accept it and demanded to see the sweet ending!
 

 
But as the episodes aired day by day, the audience began to sense something was amiss—Chen’s family’s plot to rebel gave Consort Chen a clear reason to meet her end according to ancient standards. Reluctantly, the audience began speculating about how she would die.
 

 
[It’ll probably be death by imperial decree.]
 

 
[Just look at the content of the old lady's substantial bribe to gain entry into the palace. She wanted Consort Chen to die to ensure Chen’s family’s survival, trading death for exile. It seems clear who the Emperor’s favorite truly is.]
 

 
[If it’s really due to family pressure, while it makes sense, Consort Chen’s character would lose its appeal.]
 

 
Despite the speculation, no one really wanted to see Consort Chen die.
 

 
So when the Emperor said he had no intention of granting Consort Chen’s death, the CP fans breathed a sigh of relief.
 

 
See, the Emperor couldn’t bear to kill his little darling!
 

 
However, the pressure from the previous dynasty cast a shadow over the harem.
 

 
Attentive viewers noticed that Consort Chen mentioned the Empress more frequently. Since the Empress was given a white silk for her demise, Consort Chen's tone when referring to her sister had softened considerably, carrying a vague sense of regret. Some felt this was because, with the death, the grievances were forgotten, while others thought Consort Chen’s tone not only lacked hatred but also carried a hint of affection...
 

 
Affection?
 

 
How could that be? The woman who was fixated on her own child.
 

 
Distracted by this mysterious sisterly bond, the audience even felt relieved when they saw Consort Chen practicing her dance while asking for poison—see, the Consort still had the energy to harm others, she must be quite lively!
 

 
The audience watched with smiles as Consort Chen performed a dance for Emperor Ming.
 

 
The director, using all his skills, switched camera angles and zoomed in and out, allowing the audience to experience the Emperor’s perspective and become captivated by the beauty’s every move and smile, temporarily forgetting the oppressive storyline of the previous dynasty. Indeed, despite the transient adversity and gloom, Consort Chen would always be tenderly waiting in the harem, and the Emperor was determined to protect both the empire and the Consort...
 

 
As they watched this scene, the audience, in unison, displayed a blissful, drunken-like smile.
 

 
[Wuwuwu, Consort Chen is absolutely stunning!]
 

 
[No matter the floods of the previous dynasty, I just want my Consort Chen to enjoy herself every day!]
 

 
[I wonder what expression the Emperor and the two ministers have now…]
 

 
[To the person above, why don’t you look in the mirror?]
 

 
As the dance concluded, with Emperor Ming catching the fainting Consort Chen and seeing her spitting blood in his arms, the audience’s smiles froze on their faces.
 

 
Seeing Consort Chen’s final words, the audience’s smiles gradually faded.
 

 
Then, Consort Chen took her last breath.
 

 
The character's inner monologue could be extracted, but during filming, it wasn’t directly heard by the director and was only included in post-production and selectively broadcast. And Consort Chen’s final thoughts were broadcasted.
 

 
[In this lifetime, Consort Chen loved only two people.
 

 
One was her elder sister, the model for all women in the family, whom her family wanted her to enter the palace to bear children for.
 

 
The other was herself.]
 

 
......???
 

 
Where is the dog emperor???
 

 
The audience, who had just been left with a bitter taste, was stunned.
 

 
Perhaps anticipating the reaction after this episode aired, the production team quietly posted a "behind-the-scenes" photo on their official Weibo—
 

 
@TVSeriesMingEmperorExtra:
 

 
The Emperor is also crying with you [dog head emoji]
 

 
Attached was a photo of Song Wanzhuo with her eyes closed and tears streaming in the capsule.
# Chapter10
Song Wanzhuo was miserable.
 

 
When he woke up from the holographic pod, the tears in the corner of his eyes had already dried. He didn't even realize that he had been crying; he just felt an emptiness inside. How to describe that feeling...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was quite self-absorbed, with high standards for women, and had entered the entertainment industry early, so he had never been in a serious relationship. All his past flings were light-hearted and didn't leave any scars. He didn’t understand that this feeling was called losing someone he loved. While enduring the subtle gazes of the other staff members and rubbing his chin with one hand, he finally figured out what this feeling was when he returned to his room!
 

 
It was like... finding out that all the jungle monsters were cleared when playing a jungler in a game.
 

 
Or when playing mid-lane, the minion wave was pushed by the support.
 

 
Or shipping the wrong CP (couple pairing) when watching *Naruto* and *Bleach*.
 

 
A sense of melancholy, discomfort, and a feeling of never wanting to love again.
 

 
It wasn’t until the next day, during a rest day, when the memories of the movie "Instinct" came flooding back, that Song Wanzhuo clutched his chest and sat up.
 

 
"Damn!"
 

 
"My beloved consort is dead!"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo moved his hand from his chest to his left cheek, let out a sob, and started to cry.
 

 
All the little moments they had shared flooded his mind, as if he had been hit with countless blows, making him see stars. His mind was filled with Consort Chen, and he even had a strange thought—it's all because *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* is a historical drama. If he had met Consort Chen in modern times, he would have resisted all the pressure from fans and married her as his wife!
 

 
"Ugh... What the hell is wrong with me..."
 

 
Overwhelmed.
 

 
Completely overwhelmed.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo grabbed his phone and dialed his agent's number. "Bro, my wife died!"
 

 
"…"
 

 
Woken up at seven in the morning, the agent groggily answered, "When did you get married?"
 

 
Song Wanzhuo briefly explained the situation.
 

 
Oh, so he just couldn't get out of character.
 

 
Recalling the amount of commission Song Wanzhuo earned for him in the first half of the year, the agent's tone became more patient. "So, what do you want to do about it?"
 

 
"I want to time-travel to the modern era and date Consort Chen. I want to give her happiness. She loves me so much, but I can't give her anything..." With a slightly stuffy nose, Song Wanzhuo sounded just like a heartbroken young man. "I'm heartbroken! This is my first time being heartbroken at my age! I can't lose her!"
 

 
Suddenly, the agent was wide awake.
 

 
That evening, when Song Wanzhuo logged onto Weibo and saw that his crying photo had been posted as a behind-the-scenes snippet, his mature mindset completely collapsed.
 

 
Wah, women are all liars!
 

 
And so, the world had one more man heartbroken over Consort Chen.
 

 
※
 

 
The role of Consort Chen received a great response, which indeed gave Tong Zhao a good start.
 

 
Her type of "true self" character is quite rare, and invitations to audition for palace drama roles and female characters with femme fatale personas poured in like snowflakes. Even after Sister Chu filtered out some poorly conceived projects that were completely out of consideration, there were still quite a few options left.
 

 
After all, the demand for these types of dramas was immense.
 

 
However, since Tong Zhao was still a newcomer, there were only two roles where she would have significant screen time.
 

 
"One is the female lead, and the other is the second female lead."
 

 
Tong Zhao took a look.
 

 
The whole "family" in her mind peeked out as well.
 

 
"The Story of Consort Xi" tells the story of an orphan girl who enters the palace as a stand-in for her legitimate sister and climbs her way up to become an imperial consort.
 

 
"Palace Heart as Priority"
 

 
The first and second female leads are sisters. When they first entered the palace, they thought they would rely on each other for survival. However, the second sister was blinded by the overwhelming power and glory, gradually becoming corrupted and advancing her status by harming others. When the elder sister became the empress, the second sister even wanted to kill her and take her place. In the end, evil does not prevail over good. The merciful elder sister spared her from the death penalty and sent her to a temple to spend her days with ancient Buddha statues and oil lamps.
 

 
Consort Chen: "The first one is still passable, but what is the second one? Forget it. If I were playing the role, that Empress sister wouldn't survive past the third episode. I'd send her off joyfully the moment she gains favor."
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Have you noticed that these two scripts have something in common?"
 

 
Consort Chen: "What is it?"
 

 
Tong Zhao: "Everyone loves watching you play out sisterly yuri (girl-love) dramas."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Back in the palace... Forget it, let’s not talk about that world. Ever since I met Immortal Master Lu, I knew I would never be interested in women again in this lifetime.”
 

 
Tong Zhao flipped through the scripts for a while.
 

 
They were clearly targeting her recent popularity with the "empress-consort yuri vibe," but she didn't want to keep repeating herself—having multiple personalities was her advantage, and milking one personality dry would be like crippling her own skills. Although it was a pity to give up such easy opportunities, Tong Zhao still tossed those two scripts aside.
 

 
Why doesn't anyone dare to give her something different?
 

 
※
 

 
Halfway through the filming of the first season of *Star-Selected Girls*...
 

 
The members were given a week off and could return to modern life with internet access.
 

 
Xu Zhu was in a pretty good mood initially.
 

 
During the break, she could go shopping at the mall using the secondary card provided by Father Tong, and return to the Tong residence to enjoy the princess room that Tong Zhao used to live in, without having to squeeze into a dorm with those poor fellow trainees and go online to see how many new fans she had gained...
 

 
Her good mood ended the moment she got online.
 

 
Xu Zhu's WeChat messages exploded, all urging her to watch *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*.
 

 
"OMG, Xu Zhu, your sister's performance as the Consort is amazing! How did she land such a perfect role? Was it thanks to your dad? That's incredible. Other people hit countless walls before landing a role that fits them so well..."
 

 
"Ahhh, please reply to my message!"
 

 
What made Xu Zhu's heart tighten the most was a message from Ning Zhiyi, Tong Zhao's childhood friend and ex-boyfriend—
 

 
"Zhuzhu, have you watched *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles*? Is the rumor about her and Song Wanzhuo true?"
 

 
After all her secret efforts, Ning Zhiyi not only broke up with the proud and stubborn Tong Zhao but also became very close to her (Xu Zhu). But now, he was concerned about whether Tong Zhao's rumored romance was true... Wait a minute, Song Wanzhuo? Brother Wanzhuo? How did they end up together? She clearly heard that after the first audition, Brother Wanzhuo was in a bad mood and wanted to replace Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu was furious and opened both Weibo and news about Tong Zhao at the same time.
 

 
Every single headline was so dazzling that it hurt her eyes.
 

 
"The Enchanting Consort Tong Zhao, the first woman to evoke real feelings in Song Wanzhuo, makes her debut."
 

 
"Unfiltered Version: Tong Zhao as Consort Chen - Scene Highlights."
 

 
"Consort Chen's Charming Bell Dance in Ultra HD (For the holographic version, please visit Channel 2 for paid viewing)."
 

 
"Epic Highlight: Consort Chen Slays in the Harem."
 

 
#SongWanzhuoTongZhao#
 

 
As Xu Zhu browsed through the topics related to Tong Zhao, seeing people genuinely discussing and praising her, Xu Zhu's chest rose and fell continuously. Drinking two sips of ice water only made her feel more nauseous. Memories flooded back—the two of them growing up as close as sisters, and in terms of appearance, academics, or talents, Tong Zhao always outshone her.
 

 
Xu Zhu blamed it all on Tong Zhao having a good mother.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother was beautiful, so her skin and features were better.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mother married well, so she could live like a little princess.
 

 
Fortunately, Xu Zhu's mother won once and took it all back.
 

 
With Tong Zhenming's support, Xu Zhu felt she could finally surpass Tong Zhao in the entertainment industry!
 

 
However, the harsh reality hit her in the face. Tong Zhao's subconscious wasn't crushed by repeated blows; instead, she stood up, amazed the audience, and made them praise her "true self" for its strength...
 

 
The movie *Instinct* is a vast free market, and a ban is impossible.
 

 
The Tong family couldn't manage it, and Xu Zhu certainly didn't have the power to do so either.
 

 
Xu Zhu racked her brain, desperately thinking of a way to pull Tong Zhao down.
 

 
She couldn't think of anything.
 

 
Finally, when her peripheral vision caught sight of Ning Zhiyi's WeChat message to her, Xu Zhu had a sudden flash of inspiration and realized the key—Tong Zhao could play Consort Chen so well because her true nature was to seduce men. So, why not cast her in a completely opposite role? Dig a pit for her and mislead her.
 

 
#TongZhao#
 

 
#ZhangMengTongZhao#
 

 
Due to Consort Chen's final inner monologue elevating the hidden bond of sisterhood, a new CP (couple pairing) fanbase suddenly emerged, generating some discussion. Actually, the topic of #StarSelectedGirlsXuZhu# wasn't unpopular either, but Xu Zhu knew very well that it was all backed by a marketing company putting in paid efforts…
 

 
With a direction in mind, Xu Zhu's brain calmed down.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn't that stupid.
 

 
But what if it was a great opportunity?
 

 
She could tell the production team that her sister was actually very strong and independent in private; as long as they gave her a template to follow, she could play the role well. She could also promise that the Tong family would help invest in marketing and promotion. Xu Zhu already had this level of authority, given to her by Tong Zhenming...


 
At worst, she could offer Tong Zhao a female lead role.
 

 
Thanks to the Tong family’s connections working behind the scenes, Xu Zhu had quite a few scripts to choose from. However, none of them offered the first female lead; nobody dared to give such a crucial role to a newbie who had never starred in an instinct movie. The available roles were all ones that lacked difficulty. Xu Zhu went through all the scripts that the Tong family could influence and finally found an invitation.
 

 
A semi-reality apocalypse movie, *Countdown: 72 Hours*.
 

 
The role offered to Xu Zhu was that of the female lead's younger sister, a sweet and innocent character.
 

 
"This one is good."
 

 
Xu Zhu didn't overestimate herself; she felt that a character who screams for help whenever faced with trouble suited her just fine.
 

 
The female lead in *Countdown: 72 Hours* is a strong, emotionally detached woman who leads her sister to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, with a mission to complete in three days. This type of reality show-style movie became a trend after the rise of holographic consciousness filming. The audience watches the live stream online, and it is the genre where the director has the least ability to interfere.
 

 
Xu Zhu thought through the details carefully; she believed convincing the production team wouldn’t be a problem.
 

 
The problem was—
 

 
"Sigh, that woman probably won’t accept the invitation. She should just keep doing palace dramas."
 

 
Xu Zhu dug a pit with no hope of success.
# Chapter11
Tong Zhao was unaware of her stepsister's covert actions.
 

 
Even if she knew, she couldn't be bothered.
 

 
Since the role of Consort Chen became popular, all the comments on her Weibo were warmly calling her "Consort." Consort Chen was quite pleased, though Han Zhi, who managed her Weibo, was a bit frustrated: "It used to be 'brother' only."
 

 
Female reporter Liang Liang joked: "Not just that; there are also many men in the comments."
 

 
The fans attracted by Consort Chen were mostly boyfriend and husband types. With ambitions of rising to fame and marrying a gentle wife, what man with big aspirations wouldn't want a charming wife like Tong Zhao? Of course, it's just a dream—marrying her is impossible, but enjoying her performances will have to do.
 

 
The problem is, there are no new works.
 

 
They could only revisit existing clips, getting obsessed.
 

 
[Where’s the agent? Where’s the company? Hurry up and get Consort Chen new roles. Even if there are no new dramas, variety shows and interviews would do, right? They don’t even know how to dig up treasure when it’s in their hands. I’m done with this.]
 

 
[I can’t believe no one is offering Consort Chen any palace drama roles. Could it be they are too picky?]
 

 
[I’m going to die if I don’t see Consort Chen! Consort Chen, please post a selfie soon!]
 

 
The empress is anxious, not the emperor, fearing that Tong Zhao might waste her stunning start.
 

 
Tong Zhao's life has been quite fulfilling. Since her return, she has consistently practiced meditation and slow cultivation, finally achieving the effect of cleansing her bones and marrow. Her appearance has subtly improved again—she still looks like herself, but her skin can withstand any external damage. Even after ten hours of wind, rain, and sun, she still looks as smooth and flawless as jade in photos.
 

 
After the role of Consort Chen became popular, some former wealthy friends reached out to her, all celebrating and congratulating her. Tong Zhao found there was a bit of a generation gap between them, so she mostly laughed it off. The only message that caught her attention was from Wei Zekai, the only son of the Wei family.
 

 
"Tong Zhao, are you free to accompany me to the jewelry exhibition on Sunday?"
 

 
"Come on, please reply to my message. I told them that we're good friends and you could be invited, but they don’t believe it."
 

 
The Wei family is indeed very wealthy.
 

 
Wei Zekai is great in many ways, except for being narcissistic and a bit of a smart mouth. He was very loyal and had helped Tong Zhao many times in her difficult moments. However, due to Xu Zhu's manipulations and the resulting misunderstandings between them—one being unwilling to explain and the other being sensitive and fragile—they eventually fell out.
 

 
Tong Zhao is one to remember both grudges and favors.
 

 
Not recognizing good intentions in her youth, she feels the need to repay them now that she has returned.
 

 
"Sure, but I've fallen out with my family, so I don’t have suitable clothes for formal occasions. You'll have to arrange something for me."
 

 
"No problem!"
 

 
After agreeing on the meeting time, Tong Zhao recalled the jewelry exhibition in her mind.
 

 
...
 

 
In her past life, when she had ruined the Consort Chen role and was wallowing in despair in a small apartment, Wei Zekai had come with his cleaning company to help her tidy up and find a solution. However, at that time, Tong Zhao had failed to grasp the helping hand of her friend and didn't remember the invitation. She had never actually attended.
 

 
Now that Tong Zhao was doing well, it was understandable why Wei Zekai’s invitation was so flattering.
 

 
He probably wanted to show off.
 

 
—My friend is amazing and has become a big star!
 

 
—I heard many people want to see her but can’t? Only this young master can get her out!
 

 
—Ha, I’m so awesome.
 

 
Tong Zhao could see through his thoughts clearly and smiled.
 

 
On Sunday, Wei Zekai indeed arrived in his Lamborghini to pick up Tong Zhao.
 

 
A seven-figure sports car was parked prominently in front of the residential area, and when the person saw Tong Zhao, he frowned. “Tong Zhao, you live in a place like this? Did your salary get swallowed up and you didn’t tell me?”
 

 
Wei Zekai’s tone was arrogant and mixed with disbelief.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought about how his relationships never lasted long, likely due to his low emotional intelligence.
 

 
Interpreting his words with some understanding, it meant, “This place is too rundown for you. If your salary has been swallowed up, just say so. I can help.”
 

 
“Ordinary working-class people should live here. How much can I earn from a guest role? Just getting some furniture will do,” Tong Zhao said calmly as she got into the passenger seat, reminding him, “Last time you asked me to remind you to avoid speaking too harshly. Try using a more emotionally intelligent approach.”
 

 
Wei Zekai raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment: “The place you live... it’s quite interesting.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled at him indulgently.
 

 
She thought, sigh, how naïve.
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao’s casual outfit, Wei Zekai asked her, “Where do you get your styling done? Which place do you usually use?”
 

 
Previously, when Tong Zhao had a driver, Wei Zekai was naturally unaware.
 

 
She gave him an address, and Wei Zekai took her to a well-hidden styling salon. The staff here recognized Miss Tong immediately, and a stylist she was familiar with greeted her with a smile. Tong Zhao still had a significant balance on her membership card here, but Wei Zekai, not knowing the details, worried that her balance might run out. To avoid any awkwardness if asked whether she needed a top-up, he directly charged 100,000 yuan to the account: “You’re here to accompany me, so it should be on my account.”
 

 
In reality, among this group of rich second-generation individuals, who haven’t been rebellious and had their card suspended by their family? They all rely on their friends for support. Tong Zhao found it amusing to watch Wei Zekai think he was subtly preserving her pride.
 

 
Tong Zhao lay on a massage chair, closing her eyes to relax while the makeup artist worked on her.
 

 
The makeup artist understood her intention and left the eye makeup for last.
 

 
During the waiting period, Wei Zekai went to the men’s lounge to play video games.
 

 
Just as he was about to finish a level, the revolving door behind him was pushed open: “Mr. Wei, Miss Tong is ready.”
 

 
Originally, Wei Zekai intended to just glance over and then turn back to finish the game level first.
 

 
But when he looked over, he couldn’t take his eyes off her.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was already tall, looked even taller in her champagne-colored high heels, which made her legs appear exceptionally long and her aura extraordinary. Since she was only attending an exhibition and an evening event, she had dressed in a more modest pearl-white gown. Her hair, styled in soft waves cascading down her back, was dark and smooth.
 

 
Wei Zekai set down the game controller and quickly walked over to her, wanting to touch the ends of her hair to see if it felt as soft as he imagined.
 

 
“Don’t, big brother,” Tong Zhao said, stopping his hand: “It’s been set with hairspray.”
 

 
“Isn’t it naturally like this?”
 

 
“Who is born with such a perfect hairstyle? Straight men always say nonsense.”
 

 
Wei Zekai clicked his tongue in amazement, looking at Tong Zhao with the same awe as if he had discovered a new continent.
 

 
The gaze didn’t seem to be directed at a beautiful woman.
 

 
Tong Zhao was familiar with this kind of look. Wei Zekai usually had the same expression when seeing a brand-new figure model. If he stared too long, he would likely make a comment. She was curious to hear what Wei Zekai would say next, and a simple “beautiful” would probably exhaust his vocabulary.
 

 
Wei Zekai straightened up and gave a thumbs-up: “Impressive.”
 

 
……
 

 
She underestimated him; Tong Zhao realized.
 

 
The jewelry exhibition was hosted by a well-known domestic jewelry brand. It wasn’t very large, was not open to the public, and required an invitation to enter. Reporters were not allowed in, but Tong Zhao had still informed Chu Jie about it—she wanted to maintain control over her private life but also didn’t want her agent to be the last to know about the news.
 

 
Tong Zhao was accustomed to such events and saw some familiar faces.
 

 
In the past, when she attended similar events, she was the daughter of the Tong family.
 

 
People looked at her, but what they were really looking at was the Tong family; they had no curiosity about a rich young lady who was essentially a blank slate because everything was straightforward and apparent.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was sure that the attention she received was due to her as an individual.
 

 
“Come on, let’s go over and say hello.”
 

 
Wei Zekai accurately pinpointed where the group of rich second-generation people had gathered.
 

 
Tong Zhao secretly found it amusing and graciously activated the empress consort’s special skill, “Overwhelm the Crowd with Glamour.”
 

 
Once the buff was activated, Tong Zhao didn’t feel any different.
 

 
Wei Zekai naturally led her in front of his former acquaintances. Tong Zhao knew these people, and they knew her, but the way they looked at her now was as if they had never seen her before!
 

 
Her graceful figure and the lighting at the jewelry exhibition, seemingly designed just for her, illuminated her with an otherworldly aura; she was beautiful from head to toe. Tong Zhao smiled politely at them, and the group of second-generation rich kids instantly softened.
 

 
Even though he had denied any romantic rumors, Wei Zekai still felt very proud.
 

 
His gaze at Tong Zhao now resembled Zhang Fei looking at Guan Yu—
 

 
“What a good buddy!”
 

 
At this moment, a male voice with a hint of anger came from behind them: “Tong Zhao?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around to see Ning Zhiyi, who was with Xu Zhu.
 

 
He looked at Tong Zhao with disapproval, as if being with someone like Wei Zekai was a very degenerate act. However, his disapproving gaze lasted less than three seconds before turning into a look of astonishment—
 

 
Had Tong Zhao always been this beautiful?
 

 
Xu Zhu nervously tugged at Ning Zhiyi’s sleeve and then timidly addressed them: “Wei Shao, Sister, what are you doing here…?”
 

 
The outward timidity belied the deep jealousy inside.
 

 
Sister was like a cunning fox; despite not having an invitation from their father, she still managed to cling to Wei Shao’s arm and show up boldly!
 

 
Tong Zhao now looked at Ning Zhiyi as if he were a stranger, focusing instead on her stepsister.
 

 
Seeing the confusion on Tong Zhao's beautiful face, the others turned to look at them and Tong Zhao asked, "Do we look like we’re related by blood?" She then frowned slightly, showing some discomfort as if she had been offended.
 

 
The contrast between their faces was like night and day.
 

 
After stepping into the entertainment industry, Xu Zhu’s appearance improved, upgrading from a plain neighborhood girl to a small beauty. However, she was still not on the same level as Tong Zhao. Especially with the aura of her current appearance, not even the expensive jewelry on display could rival her in prominence.
 

 
In comparison...
 

 
The two didn’t look like sisters at all.
 

 
The second-generation rich kids were very straightforward and didn’t see the need to care about Xu Zhu's feelings as an illegitimate daughter: “Not at all. Tong Zhao is much better looking.”
 

 
“I also think they don’t look alike.”
 

 
Hearing the consensus, Xu Zhu’s face showed panic. She frowned in distress, lacking the previous assertiveness she had shown when she came to confront Tong Zhao. She now played the victim. Wei Zekai was even more displeased: “Ning Zhiyi, manage your girlfriend. How did she get here? I drove her here myself.”
 

 
Hearing this, Xu Zhu became even more convinced that Tong Zhao, like the Consort, relied on men to succeed.
 

 
Tong Zhao had also said the same thing to Ning Zhiyi.
 

 
It seemed that in their mutual childhood friend’s eyes, Tong Zhao had already fallen from grace!
 

 
Ning Zhiyi looked at Tong Zhao with disappointment: "The way you appear in instinct films can’t deceive anyone. Your true nature is exactly like the Consort’s. I used to think you were different, a very independent girl.”
 

 
Well said.
 

 
If it weren’t inappropriate, Xu Zhu would have really liked to applaud him and ask him to increase the dosage.
 

 
Since the stepsister liked Ning Zhiyi, she would definitely want to prove herself after his provocation and might be more likely to take on the role in the apocalyptic film that didn’t suit her!
 

 
However, in an instant, the charming and graceful Tong Zhao changed.
 

 
While the second-generation rich kids behind her were oblivious, Ning Zhiyi, facing Tong Zhao directly, felt an overwhelming sense of hostility!
 

 
It was like an invisible sword, slicing through the air and pressing against his forehead.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao returned, she has been diligently practicing. Although she hadn’t succeeded in establishing a foundation, she had reached a state of surrounding spiritual energy. Ning Zhiyi’s words had directly awakened the dormant Lu Xianzhang within her, even making the enraged Lu Xianzhang take over her primary personality for half a minute.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, caught off guard, was so startled by the spiritual energy that he collapsed to the ground, his knees buckling.
 

 
[Let me strike him! This person’s words are just like my ex-husband’s!]
# Chapter12
[Lu Xianzhang, calm down!]
 

 
[Zhao Zhao is in a lawful society; she can’t kill people.]
 

 
Everyone tried to persuade her. Unlike usual, the Consort, who often competed with Lu Xianzhang, was now smiling happily and encouraging her: [Yes, increase the intensity. Let him underestimate this palace. So what if he relies on men? I’m a professional at relying on men. I can make the world’s supreme ruler my lapdog. Someone like him doesn’t even deserve to carry Zhao Zhao’s shoes.]
 

 
Lu Xianzhang, still seething with anger, used invisible sword energy to strike Ning Zhiyi’s knee before returning control to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew Ning Zhiyi wouldn’t be able to stand up for at least a cup of tea.
 

 
“Brother Zhiyi, hey, get up quickly…”
 

 
The scene of Ning Zhiyi collapsing on the spot immediately became the center of attention in the exhibition hall. Xu Zhu anxiously tried to help him up but found she didn’t have the strength. Fortunately, security guards came forward immediately. After confirming that he couldn’t stand up on his own, they had to carry him to the lounge like eagles picking up a chick.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi, puzzled, asked, “What’s wrong with him?”
 

 
From the perspective of onlookers, it looked like Ning Zhiyi, who had been boasting, suddenly collapsed onto the floor and couldn’t get up.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Could he have a hidden illness?”
 

 
Second-Generation B: “Ah, we should have recorded that. We missed a great chance to get likes on social media.”
 

 
Second-Generation C: “Xu Zhu is impressive. She and Ning Zhiyi have only been seeing each other for a short time, and already Ning Zhiyi is weak in the knees in broad daylight.”
 

 
?
 

 
Everyone turned their heads in unison to look at the driver.
 

 
Tong Zhao responded in the tone of Young Master Wei: “Didn’t he say I’m the Consort? He should kneel when he sees me.”
 

 
The second-generation people hadn’t expected her to play along so well despite her delicate and otherworldly appearance. But thinking about it, since she gets along so well with Young Master Wei, how could her way of thinking be ordinary? It made sense and was quite amusing.
 

 
Tong Zhao said this while still radiating the aura of the Consort, her almond-shaped eyes holding a faint smile, subtly outlining an expensive kind of allure. Ning Zhiyi was right; a Consort fighting in the harem could only rely on men, but not everyone was worthy of her reliance. Most men who saw her subconsciously felt they only deserved to flatter the Consort.
 

 
“To pay such respect, prostration and all, what about me beside you?” Young Master Wei turned to her and asked.
 

 
This rascal has even learned how to flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao asked in return, “What do you think?”
 

 
Wei Zekai responded with caution, “I’d better keep my distance from you, or I might end up as a eunuch.”
 

 
…Well, what a talent.
 

 
In her previous life, after being heavily impacted, Tong Zhao had withdrawn into her shell like a snail, while Xu Zhu had used her thick skin and social skills to break into the circles of wealthy second-generation elites. Now that she had lived through it again, Tong Zhao thought there would be a generational gap with these second-generation elites. However, after Young Master Wei showed her off around, she found it wasn’t the case. They got along well, and after seeing the confrontation between the two, Young Master Wei assured her that he would never bring Xu Zhu into their circle in the future.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t aiming to hit her stepsister over such trivial matters, but she inadvertently closed the door on Xu Zhu’s entry into the second-generation elite circle.
 

 
After strolling for a while, Wei Zekai noticed her bare hands and asked, “Before you ran away from home, did your dad even take off the jewelry you were wearing?”
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t aware of the severity of his friend’s family issues.
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes, her emotional undertone cold: “I didn’t want his things. I’m not interested.”
 

 
“Well said,” Wei Zekai casually stopped at a counter selling gemstone watches. “You should appreciate what I give you. I haven’t given you a congratulatory gift for your debut success yet. How about this one?”
 

 
He picked up a starry sky watch.
 

 
The gemstones on the watch face were more striking than time itself, dazzling and attractive, and the price was equally impressive.
 

 
Even among second-generation elites, not many are so casually willing to buy a seven-figure watch for a friend, essentially wearing a car on their wrist. Wei Zekai lamented, “Watches should never be cheap. The more expensive, the better.”
 

 
Tong Zhao asked, “Any insights?”
 

 
Wei Zekai had his own harsh perspective: “When dealing with someone like Ning Zhiyi, you can tell him, ‘My time is worth a million for a full rotation. Our sense of time is very different, and you don’t deserve to have me waste it on you.’”
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, but she still didn’t accept the watch.
 

 
Wei Zekai insisted on giving her a debut gift, reasoning that when he first performed in a class play in elementary school, she had also bought him a gift. Since that was a long time ago and Tong Zhao didn’t remember it, she finally relented and accepted a relatively cheaper diamond-studded bracelet watch. It looked quite nice on her slender, delicate wrist.
 

 
The friends also rallied to pool funds to buy her gifts—
 

 
“Tong Zhao, from now on, you’re the only star among us!”
 

 
“Yeah, if we want to invest in movies, it’s better to have an acquaintance than to be a naïve investor.”
 

 
“I say we should get that starry sky watch! Or just buy it; after all, Zhao Zhao has two hands, just right for the left Blue Dragon and the right White Tiger.”
 

 
“I think you’re really the Tiger.”
 

 
Finally, they settled for a sapphire necklace as a congratulatory gift.
 

 
Turning the jewelry exhibition into a shopping spree for friends was a privilege for these second-generation elites. They enjoyed the fun of choosing gifts together, and as soon as the necklace arrived, they urged Tong Zhao to put it on. Her neck was slender and elongated, and her shoulder line was impeccable. The gemstone pendant fell between her collarbones, blue like a tear from her heart.
 

 
With the aura activated, Tong Zhao exuded an ethereal grace.
 

 
However, her slightly shallow eyes, like a cat's, conveyed just the right amount of aloofness. Even if someone had watched *The Emperor Ming's Legend* and was overwhelmed by the impulse to pile all the world’s treasures in front of her, they still wouldn’t dare pursue her.
 

 
The Consort Shen felt puzzled: *“I have this strange feeling that ministers from the previous dynasty are partnering to send gifts to me…”*
 

 
Tong Zhao was both amused and touched. She didn’t just accept gifts without reciprocation; she promised that once she became familiar with the entertainment industry, she would definitely bring everyone along to earn money together.
 

 
When Wei Zekai was taking her home, he casually emphasized, “You must wear the award while wearing the gift I gave you. Otherwise, it won’t do for others to have it and you not. You’re now the representative of our little circle, the face of it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao finally recalled some memories.
 

 
She had been too young and narrow-minded back then. Even though friends had tried to help her when she was self-pitying, she hadn’t seized the opportunity. After experiencing countless worlds in fast-wear scenarios, she could now rise on her own without others' help.
 

 
But…
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
“Thank you? Saying thanks makes it seem distant between good brothers.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, the spokesperson for brotherhood like Liu, Guan, and Zhang, laughed heartily.
 

 
※
 

 
Xu Zhu and Ning Zhiyi, the troubled couple, were furious.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi lay in the medical room for a while, his legs still feeling weak. The pampered young master was terrified he might be disabled for life and urgently called his private doctor. The doctor arrived a bit late, but by the time he showed up, the residual spiritual energy on Ning Zhiyi’s knees had dissipated, and he could stand up.
 

 
Xu Zhu had never seen her refined and elegant brother in such a disheveled state.
 

 
They placed the blame squarely on Tong Zhao.
 

 
Thinking about this, Xu Zhu felt a bit better, as she had always feared that Ning Zhiyi might be taken away by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Now that she had witnessed Tong Zhao’s true nature, it was time to wake up!
 

 
Xu Zhu pleaded softly, “Brother Zhiyi, don’t blame me; she might be so cold to you because she cares about Young Master Wei.”
 

 
In reality, Xu Zhu thought Tong Zhao was simply venting her jealousy.
 

 
Tong Zhao definitely disliked her and was cold to Ning Zhiyi because of it.
 

 
This was something Ning Zhiyi shouldn’t have figured out.
 

 
Sure enough, hearing Wei’s surname made Ning Zhiyi’s expression even darker.
 

 
However, despite moving in the direction she wanted, Xu Zhu felt unexpectedly unhappy. She realized that the ambiguous object of her desire was still thinking about her more attractive stepsister. Her heart felt tightly clenched, and her meticulously made-up face showed a fierce frustration.
 

 
Why does she have to play the role of the Empress so well?
 

 
Why does Tong Zhao get everything she wants?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt unbalanced.
 

 
She became even more determined to trip Tong Zhao up. After Ning Zhiyi dropped her off at home, she immediately used her connections—provided by her father—to send the script for *Countdown 72 Hours* to Tong Zhao. She even forced herself to praise her stepsister in front of the director, convincing him that Tong Zhao was just that good and suitable.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* is a live-streamed show, so if the performance is particularly poor, there will be an audience who will pay just to watch the train wreck and have a laugh, minimizing the loss for the production team.
 

 
Xu Zhu didn’t want to offend anyone; she just wanted Tong Zhao’s reputation to be ruined.
 

 
Meanwhile, Tong Zhao was comfortably soaking in a bath.
 

 
Her manager, Chu Jie, was attentive to her needs. After receiving the invitation for the leading female role, she quickly got in touch to discuss it: “I’m not sure why they invited you. Let me put it this way: I remember you don’t like cilantro, right? Well, the script they sent us is like a pie filled with cilantro—extremely fragrant, but not suitable for you.”
 

 
“What’s the content? Is it really that bad?”
 

 
Tong Zhao found the analogy quite harsh.
 

 
"’ Countdown 72 Hours’ is a live-streamed apocalypse reality show. The role they offered you is that of Feng Yanqi, a decisive and individualistic heroine, which means action scenes are inevitable. And since it’s a live format, even if you’re cast as the lead, if your performance falls short compared to other characters, you might end up overshadowed, making it a risky endeavor.”
 

 
Chu Jie’s analysis was thorough: “It’s better to stick to the style of the Empress and take on similar roles that help build a stable fan base. In the future, people will think of you first for roles with that kind of positioning.”
 

 
This is the mainstream thinking for actors in the era of instinctual films.
 

 
Empress: “Oh, those who fight and kill just don’t fit in.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Indeed, if you took the role, it would be the people fighting over you rather than vaccines in the apocalypse.”
 

 
Han Zhi: “Lu Xianzhang or Duan Ge would fit the role better.”
 

 
Duan Ge happens to be a persona that grew from Tong Zhao’s time in the apocalypse side story, similar to Lu Xianzhang in being taciturn.
 

 
“Lu doesn’t work,” the Empress insisted, “Sci-fi would turn into fantasy. Let’s go with Xiao Ge.”
 

 
While Lu Xianzhang disliked men, he also disdained relying on them. Although he had helped many lonely women on their cultivation journey, he mostly did so coldly and with a “give a fish, not a fishing rod” attitude, which strained his relationship with the Empress.
 

 
However, Duan Ge had a nurturing, caring attitude towards women and was well-liked by the Empress.
 

 
After drying herself off, Tong Zhao applied body lotion to her arms and thighs. "It's perfect. The role of Feng Yanqi seems like it was made just for me."
 

 
"…"
 

 
"………???"
 

 
Her manager began to question whether her ears were malfunctioning.
 

 
At that moment, as Tong Zhao was filling the bathtub, the sound of the water in her manager's ears sounded just like the water getting into their artist's head.
# Chapter13
The agent tried to persuade Tong Zhao for a while but couldn’t change her mind.
 

 
Coincidentally, the assistant director from the crew of *Countdown 72 Hours*, who was a friend of hers, was contacted to find out why the invitation was extended to Tong Zhao. The assistant director explained straightforwardly that the team felt Tong Zhao was particularly suited for the role, especially since Xu Zhu, who plays the younger sister in the female lead's role, strongly recommended her!
 

 
Well, it seemed like the whole world had lost its mind.
 

 
Sister Chu felt like she was the only sane person in the world, surrounded by confusion.
 

 
Sister Chu had no choice but to call Tong Zhao again: “It’s strange, the assistant director from *Countdown 72 Hours* said they thought you were perfect for the role, and it seems that Xu Zhu, who plays the second female lead, strongly recommended you. Do you know her?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Yes, I know her. We have a grudge.”
 

 
“Oh, a grudge? No wonder… huh????”
 

 
As Sister Chu was surprised, Tong Zhao had already figured it out—
 

 
Xu Zhu was plotting something.
 

 
A good lead role opportunity is something a newcomer would dream of. Moreover, Feng Yanqi’s character is outstanding, and if performed well, it could overshadow everyone else. Xu Zhu personally endorsing it likely means she wants to use this opportunity to undermine Tong Zhao.
 

 
But can Tong Zhao really perform well?
 

 
Xu Zhu doesn’t think so.
 

 
On the other end, the agent’s displeasure was evident: “It’s a good thing I asked; otherwise, we would have stepped into a pitfall. I’ll decline the invitation now. We won’t work with Xu Zhu or any of her associated projects in the future.” Sister Chu didn’t delve into the details of their grudge, as such situations are too common in the entertainment industry. She always respects the artists' wishes, and being forced into roles is the worst thing.
 

 
“There’s no need to decline. I’m taking this role.”
 

 
Based on Tong Zhao’s understanding of Xu Zhu, she isn’t someone who would rely on underhanded tactics.
 

 
Using such a direct approach means her options for covert actions are limited.
 

 
That’s a good thing.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the bed, applying transparent nail polish while discussing the details with her agent over the phone.
 

 
Consort Chen was displeased: "Red isn't pretty at all. It's like not wearing any at all."
 

 
Han Zhi: "I think it looks quite good."
 

 
Consort Chen: "Who’s playing the role this time? Is it the Lu surname or Xiao Ge?"
 

 
After hanging up the phone, Tong Zhao finally had time to join the meeting: "Originally, Lu Xianchang would have been fine, but now that I know it's my cheap stepsister playing the lead role’s younger sister... It can only be Duan Ge."
 

 
A female reporter commented wryly: "If Old Lu were in the role, Xu Zhu wouldn't last five minutes. She definitely wouldn’t be able to handle the protective sister scenes."
 

 
Lu Xianchang had no way to refute this.
 

 
She hated being betrayed by acquaintances the most and probably couldn’t stand Xu Zhu bouncing around in front of her for even a second in the indulgent movie. The drama would be too severe, though the entertainment value would be high...
 

 
"Duan Ge, is that alright?"
 

 
From the depths of her subconscious, a gentle, slightly hoarse voice surfaced:
 

 
"Of course, I’m very willing to serve Zhao Zhao.”
 

 
Duan Ge.
 

 
Her voice had become slightly fragmented due to a mild infection from the zombie virus.
 

 
Tong Zhao's mission in the post-apocalyptic scenario was not to pursue anyone but to save three key characters. She also managed to establish a settlement in the apocalypse and, as a side note, caused the heroine who was supposed to be happily paired with the male lead to fall for her instead... but that's another story. In any case, among her many derived personalities, this one had the strongest protective instinct toward women.
 

 
"Alright, thank you."
 

 
In the dead of night, only her sea of consciousness was lively.
 

 
Tong Zhao hugged her knees and let the nail polish on her hands dry, as if embracing herself.

@Countdown72HoursV:
 

 
The last piece of the fugitive team puzzle has been found [heart][heart]
 

 
[Give me three minutes. I need to know the details of this actor in three minutes.]
 

 
[How can you discuss things if you don’t finish talking, big brother? Don't you want the water that’s coming to you?]
 

 
[“It’s rare to find an actor who can portray Feng Yanqi well! Lin Shu and Chen Yijie are both quite capable, but weren't their schedules mismatched?”]
 

 
[Look, the official account just followed a new actress!]
 

 
One word wakes people from their dreams. The name in the latest follow on the official account dazzled netizens—
 

 
@Tong ZhaoV
 

 
Is it actually her?
 

 
Since she had just debuted, many people didn’t even remember her name, only her face. As soon as they saw that delicate face, they knew it was the Consort. She had a high approval rating from the public.
 

 
High approval rating aside, the image of Consort Chen and the character Feng Yanqi just doesn’t match!
 

 
In a semi-reality show film like "Countdown 72 Hours," each actor gets a corresponding character template but no specific action instructions, only general guidance.
 

 
In contrast, in "The Chronicle of Emperor Ming," actors know exactly what to do at certain times and places.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," actors have a lot of freedom within a set framework, so some predecessors have delivered particularly impressive performances. For example, in "The Court of Storms," the high degree of freedom allowed for intense rivalries that escalated to the level of six great kingdoms, which is still fondly discussed by drama fans today.
 

 
[Oh, this?]
 

 
[No, you can’t just pick someone based on recent popularity; it’s a recipe for disaster!]
 

 
[You need to think carefully. Feng Yanqi has the heaviest workload in the drama. If the lead actress can’t handle it, the whole group could face a disastrous ending.]
 

 
[Consort’s agent, please be more thoughtful. Don’t just grab at the first opportunity; you need to use your brain.]
 

 
[Agent: Use my brain? What does that mean?]
 

 
……
 

 
Seeing these doubts about the agent’s choices, Chu Jie’s mood deteriorated slightly.
 

 
She had put a lot of thought into it, but the artist has her own ideas.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt that this role was tailor-made for her, so what could she do?
 

 
With the Tong family's connections backing her, Chu Jie inexplicably found herself on this fast track, and the production team quickly confirmed Tong Zhao's leading role. The promotion followed swiftly, making everything feel like the joy of "having influential people making things happen." Xu Zhu’s plan to tarnish Tong Zhao’s reputation and make her untouchable was to boost her fame before the shoot began.
 

 
In "Countdown 72 Hours," besides the lead character, there are also two other female roles.
 

 
If Tong Zhao doesn’t perform well, the spotlight will shift to Xu Zhu, so the current promotion is definitely not a waste, but rather a significant gain. Xu Zhu knew Tong Zhao too well. Even if Tong Zhao was indeed quite stubborn, her stubbornness was of the high-born kind.
 

 
Just like a delicate and fragile violin, even if it produces a powerful melody, it’s still not the same thing.
 

 
In Xu Zhu’s eyes, Tong Zhao was still the same as before—unable to handle provocations.
 

 
A little agitation or provocation would make her stubbornly accept a challenge with slim chances of success.
 

 
She simply wouldn't be able to perform well in "Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
...
 

 
The comments on that Weibo post were chaotic, with the majority expressing disapproval of Tong Zhao's casting.
 

 
As a newcomer, Tong Zhao was discussed with a somewhat condescending tone. Most people mocked her for overestimating herself, daring to take on any role, and being overjoyed at landing a leading role without considering if she was capable of handling the type of character.
 

 
[Trying to plant trees in the Empress’s heart, growing some pressure trees.]
 

 
[Not interested in watching anymore. Does anyone want the movie tickets I won from the lottery?]
 

 
[I want them! Why would anyone not want to watch? I’m curious to see how the Empress performs in an apocalyptic survival film. Isn’t the appeal of a live-streamed, instinctual movie in the unpredictable excitement of what might go wrong next?]
 

 
The forums were abuzz with heated discussions.
 

 
The director didn’t hire any trolls, but Xu Zhu did invest a bit to stir things up, adding fuel to the fire. The criticism was incessant.
 

 
"Let’s open the discussion: what kind of plot twists do you expect from this apocalyptic film?"
 

 
"Laughing my head off, wasn’t Sister Tang still hyping up this role a few days ago? The choice of the lead actress is just ridiculous."
 

 
Tang Jingjie, the male lead of "Countdown 72 Hours," was making his debut as the main character. Fans had been excited for days, only to be met with this shocking turn of events—
 

 
From a highly anticipated Valentine's Day release to what looks like a guaranteed flop.
 

 
Which fanbase can tolerate this?
 

 
Sister Tang couldn't take it and had to rush to the production team, privately messaging the director to reconsider.
 

 
The director, an old-school type, felt that today’s star-chasing young girls were naive and preferred to listen to familiar opinions. Since the familiar source was one who had received benefits from Xu Zhu—using Tong Zhao meant the entire promotion was taken care of by capital—it seemed like a good deal. The director shut down his Weibo and stopped paying attention.
 

 
With nowhere else to turn, Sister Tang and her team didn’t give up and desperately sought out a final option.
 

 
So, Tong Zhao opened Weibo and found that both her private messages and comments were flooded.
 

 
They were all pleas for her not to take the role.
# Chapter14
Tong Zhao was added to the production team’s WeChat group.
 

 
It happened suddenly, and someone clueless posted a screenshot of the comments on Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The screenshot was posted after she joined the group.
 

 
The props master, realizing the blunder, quickly retracted the message.
 

 
But as someone with excellent dynamic vision from her training, Tong Zhao had already seen the content. Under Han Zhi’s guidance, she responded: "It’s a good way to create buzz. Anyway, I’ll perform well. We can let the netizens fuss for a couple of days without responding, and we get the heat for free. Curiosity will bring viewers."
 

 
The lead’s nonchalant response embarrassed Tang Jingjie.
 

 
After all, it was his fans who were pleading for her not to act.
 

 
Tang Jingjie: “I’ll go post on Weibo and manage this.”
 

 
His words didn’t have much effect on his fans. Having just debuted, he had mostly been in supporting roles, and his "true self" was too gentle, attracting a group of "mommy fans." In other words, he felt AAA wouldn’t help, while fans thought BBB. No mother lets her son make decisions; they follow their mom’s advice.
 

 
As a result, it made others want to exclaim, "Damn it.”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [No need, just wait for the release.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can't back out now; I've signed the contract.]
 

 
It seemed Xu Zhu was afraid Tong Zhao might come to her senses and drop the project, so she urged the production team to finalize the contract quickly to reduce uncertainty. Xu Zhu was also in the WeChat group, and seeing her stepsister’s calm demeanor, a pang of unease surfaced.
 

 
What if she really performs well?
 

 
…
 

 
It's impossible.
 

 
Even if Tong Zhao's subconscious drive is strong, she might at best avoid a complete disaster, but she won’t excel. As netizens have said, there are two more suitable actresses in the industry, but their schedules don’t align. They and the Concubine Shen aren’t of the same type, and Xu Zhu doesn’t see any good qualities for the role of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Having thought this through, Xu Zhu relaxed and continued to feign sympathy in the WeChat group.
 

 
Xu Zhu: [Everyone, keep up the good work! ^^]
 

 
Tong Zhao did not respond.
 

 
Because she turned off her phone and began meditating and cultivating.
 

 
For several days, fans of Tang Jingjie and netizens stirred up trouble without any official response. They only received a set of costume photos, indicating that the production team was adamant about using Tong Zhao. However, there were also rumors in forums that the contract had long been signed, and the list of actors had been submitted to the Instinct Film Association, leaving no room for change.
 

 
@Countdown72Hoursv
 

 
The entire escape team is assembled!
 

 
As the female lead, Tong Zhao was unquestionably placed in the first spot. Since it’s an escape film, she wasn’t given an elaborate makeup, but her looks still outshone the remaining female supporting characters. Her beautifully shaped eyes coldly stared at the camera...
 

 
The face was still the same, but there was a subtle difference from when she played the Concubine.
 

 
That difference made her seem like a different person.
 

 
Being gazed at by the Concubine felt like being subtly teased by an invisible force.
 

 
In this costume photo, Tong Zhao’s glance at anyone felt like an electric shock—painful and deeply unsettling, yet unrelated to romantic matters.
 

 
People are visual creatures, and the moment they saw this costume photo, their confidence that Tong Zhao was unsuitable for *Countdown 72 Hours* wavered.
 

 
However, the trending comments helped them reaffirm their stance.
 

 
[If it were a traditional film, I'd be more at ease / dog head]
 

 
[Makeup can change a person's demeanor, but it can't change the "true self" in a short time.]
 

 
[If I hadn't seen Tong Zhao play the Concubine, I'd be looking forward to this film, but now...]
 

 
[And the difference in appearance between the sisters in the film is so big, it doesn’t look like they are sisters.]
 

 
This perfectly captured the sense of incongruity.
 

 
If there’s any flaw in Tong Zhao’s costume photo, it’s that she’s too beautiful.
 

 
The light makeup actually accentuates the sharp contours of her features even more. Beauty cannot be hidden or covered up.
 

 
Alright, the window of opportunity has been shattered. As soon as the costume photo was released, Xu Zhu's freshly enthusiastic fanbase exploded. The post quickly turned into a battleground between fans and haters—despite both groups being relatively small at this stage, the constant bickering caused the comments and shares to surge exponentially, achieving the level of heated discussion the production team wanted.
 

 
The day of the shoot arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
Since this was Tong Zhao’s first time participating in a live-stream format film, her manager, Chu Jie, drove her to the location while explaining the key points to pay attention to.
 

 
There is a roughly five-minute delay between the shooting and the viewing to allow the AI to automatically skip parts that cannot be broadcast, such as wardrobe malfunctions during battles. Before the film ends, the actors remain connected to the cabin, and the AI filters out unnecessary time.
 

 
For instance, when sleeping.
 

 
In the film, if an actor finds a safe place to rest beforehand, and the AI scans the area for any threats, it will skip over this part of the time, making sleep seem instantaneous. However, if an actor carelessly sleeps in a location with potential threats, random events may be triggered.
 

 
"Live shooting is the most different from traditional films; it’s more like a reality show format."
 

 
Chu Jie concluded, and Tong Zhao nodded in agreement.
 

 
Tong Zhao: "The fact that this type of thing can be popular just shows that people still have too much free time."
 

 
As she spoke, the two arrived at the venue.
 

 
When Tong Zhao walked into the shooting area, the conversation momentarily ceased, and countless eyes turned toward her, focusing intently on Tong Zhao while her manager was overlooked.
 

 
Chu Jie wasn’t annoyed; in fact, she was pleased. This was a good sign.
 

 
A promising star naturally commands attention and draws others' gazes.
 

 
Since it was a major event, Tong Zhao confidently embraced the aura of being the center of attention. Her already outstanding presence became almost dreamlike. While the female attendees could resist, the male attendees were dazzled and their hearts raced.
 

 
Aside from the director and core members who had been brainwashed by the Tong family and Xu Zhu, most of the gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism.
 

 
She is indeed beautiful.
 

 
But why should she be able to play Feng Yanqi?
 

 
This is the least beauty-focused female role of the year.
 

 
Seeing everyone's attention fully focused on her stepsister, Xu Zhu's expression fell. She felt uncomfortable, with loathing and hatred filling her chest. But then she remembered that no matter how beautiful Tong Zhao was, she was still not suitable for this role, which made her feel a bit better.
 

 
Xu Zhu's tone held a hint of disdain: "Isn't she just craving attention?"
 

 
"She is the female lead."
 

 
Unfortunately, the third female role was a straightforward girl who didn't catch onto Xu Zhu's shared animosity.
 

 
Shortly after Tong Zhao's appearance, Tang Jingjie hurried over to apologize for the issues caused by fans. Tong Zhao saw his sincere attitude, his weak demeanor, and his puppy-dog look that inspired maternal affection, so she didn't bother to argue and accepted his apology.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This kid is clearly being tightly controlled by his manager.]
 

 
Empress Chen agreed: "Not bad, has potential, might survive for three days."
 

 
Han Zhi: "He is the male lead; theoretically, he should last until the end."
 

 
Empress Chen: "What I mean is, that Xiao Ge prefers soft approaches over hard ones. He’ll do well working under her if he’s this obedient."
 

 
Despite being inexplicably labeled as the head of the family, Duan Ge didn’t refute this.
 

 
Not hearing her voice, Tong Zhao only sensed that she was smiling.
 

 
The gazes directed at Tong Zhao were filled with skepticism, contemplation, or curiosity, but she lay down in the shooting chamber as if she didn’t notice, showing no signs of a shaken mindset.
 

 
"Please ensure all actors have their connection devices properly fitted. The instinctive filming will begin in one minute."
 

 
Unlike ordinary people, Tong Zhao’s mind felt like a shared rental apartment.
 

 
A female reporter commented: "Duan Ge is great at everything except that he talks too much while taking action. If it weren’t for the need to protect someone, it would have been better if Lu Xianchang had come instead.”
 

 
When the device came to take away her "true self," the other personalities tacitly closed the door, leaving Duan Ge in the living room to welcome guests. Overcome by a strong drowsiness, she fell into a deep sleep, as if sinking into a warm, profound ocean...

[That day was the day the conspiracy was set in motion.
 

 
The virus spread through the groundwater. People, unaware of the danger, continued to drink as usual. The mutated undead and the virus spread throughout the city, causing countless deaths in despair. What’s even more perplexing is that the mastermind behind it had no demands—he didn't seek to revolt, seize power, or gain money. He simply wanted—
 

 
All skyscrapers, TV screens, and even fallen mobile phone screens reflected a young, pale face, facing the camera and recounting his achievements: “By the time you see this video, the infection rate will have reached 99%. I intend to personally end this stupid and tedious world, but…”]
 

 
"At any time, I will always leave a window open for the smart ones," the doctor smiled. "The antidote is at the top of the Tower of Wisdom. If you haven’t directly consumed contaminated water, well... you have about three days? You can come and find your Noah’s Ark, but after I die, the tower will automatically enter a defensive state..."
 

 
Thinking about the survivors who narrowly escaped the first wave of the virus, crying in despair outside the tower and slowly dying from the virus’s torment, the doctor’s smile grew more sincere, and his eyes gradually lost focus.
 

 
Feng Yanjie and his group were stranded in a mountain cabin during a weekend outing due to a heavy rainstorm, narrowly avoiding the first wave of the virus spread and becoming some of the few sober people left in K City. Upon returning to the city center and learning about the events and causes, they realized that even a simple escape was impossible!
 

 
The first wave of the virus spread through water. After the storm, the sunny weather filled the air with diluted second-wave toxins.
 

 
In 72 hours, they would be completely assimilated into the undead.
 

 
To survive, they must go to the research institute and find the antidote.
 

 
Since this is a live-action film, the plot background cannot be too complicated to avoid losing control, so the main quest for the protagonist group is clear: survive in the zombie-infested K City and head to the research institute to obtain the antidote. Completing this mission will mean passing the game.
 

 
The main antagonist, the doctor, couldn’t find an actor to achieve a similar effect, so the film was shot using traditional methods, with data directly loaded by a template specialist. This was a clever workaround by the production team.
 

 
When the protagonist’s "true self" woke up in the film, it coincided with Tang Jingjie driving into the city. The car reconnected to the network and started playing the doctor’s speech. Initially thought to be a prank, the seriousness of the situation became apparent when they couldn’t find any employees at the gas station, and upon seeing the first zombie, they realized the gravity of the situation.
 

 
The women in the car were horrified, while only Tang Jingjie was at a convenience store some distance from the car.
 

 
[High-energy opening, bullet screens for protection]
 

 
[Ahhh, Jie, run!]
 

 
[Mommy’s heart aches, seeing how scared the child is…]
 

 
As the zombie lunged ferociously at Tang Jingjie, fans watching the holographic film also felt the rush of danger!
 

 
In an instant, a heavy thud sounded as the zombie fell.
 

 
Seeing the zombie, Tong Zhao had already gotten out of the car, holding a wrench.
 

 
The wrench was stained with dark blood, clearly the tool used to crush the zombies’ heads.
 

 
She raised an eyebrow at the male lead:
 

 
“As a physical education teacher, it’s quite reasonable for me to carry a wrench, don’t you think?”
# Chapter15
[...]
 

 
"......"
 

 
At this moment, both inside and outside the scene, the reactions of the characters and the audience were in sync.
 

 
Tong Zhao nudged the zombie lying on the ground with the tip of her shoe. After confirming that it had indeed met its end, she crouched down and reached for its waist...
 

 
"Yan Qi, what are you doing?"
 

 
Tang Jingjie, horrified by her actions, covered his mouth, trying to suppress both his urge to stop her and his urge to vomit.
 

 
The audience was also curious about what she was doing.
 

 
Even though Concubine Chen liked men, there was no way she'd go after a zombie!
 

 
"Huh?"
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled out a set of keys from the zombie's pocket. "I just noticed that the fuel dispenser over there is locked and needs a key to open it. There might also be supplies we need in the convenience store. It's always a good idea to grab the keys first."
 

 
"Oh, you really think things through."
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao headed towards the convenience store.
 

 
Tang Jingjie's legs were still weak, so he could only stand in place, awkwardly locking eyes with the zombie.
 

 
Even though this was a horror movie, this scene inexplicably had a comedic vibe.
 

 
In the car, Feng Sisi carefully got out after confirming there was no danger. She tiptoed over to Tang Jingjie and tugged at his sleeve, "Kaiyu-ge, are you okay?"
 

 
According to the plot, Song Kaiyu and Feng Yanqi were a couple.
 

 
One taught language arts, the other taught physical education.
 

 
"Countdown: 72 Hours" is a story about a couple escaping with their pampered little sister.
 

 
Due to needing to pass censorship, the setting was an imaginary foreign country, which was a bit different from the domestic environment.
 

 
[...Wait, how could the male lead be in trouble? As soon as the zombie appeared, it got its head blown off by the female lead.]
 

 
[Zombie: I'm the one who's in trouble here.]
 

 
[True, the zombie's fate is tragic. Feeling sorry for it.]
 

 
[Feeling sorry +1]
 

 
The screen was filled with sympathetic comments.
 

 
"I'm fine; Yanqi protected me."
 

 
Song Kaiyu glanced toward the convenience store, just as Tong Zhao came back carrying bags full of stuff. Her beautiful, ethereal face was calm as if she had just come back from a pleasant shopping spree at a designer store rather than having just blown a zombie's head off. Meeting their gazes, she raised an eyebrow and said, "I did leave some money behind."
 

 
If a real zombie apocalypse broke out, cash would become nothing more than waste paper.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao's reasonable action somewhat reassured the two.
 

 
The director then cuts to a shot inside the convenience store.
 

 
Sure enough, a few bills were pressed down on the cashier counter.
 

 
Tong Zhao stuffed the supplies she bought into the car, filling it to the brim. After filling up the gas tank, she also took two large barrels of extra fuel. Once everything was done, she looked back at the two who were still standing dumbfounded next to the zombie. "What’s wrong? Is this your first time seeing a zombie? Are you too reluctant to leave it? Do you want to take a picture with it before we go?"
 

 
[...Hahaha, a photo with the zombie, really?!]
 

 
[I took a screenshot. Mom will make sure Jiezai gets his dream photo!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is unbelievably cool. Her "id" is truly formidable. Thank goodness Emperor Ming dotes on her; otherwise, I suspect she'd be blowing other people's heads off in the harem.]
 

 
[The Noble Consort herself administering justice!]
 

 
These words snapped the two iron-headed fools out of their daze, and they hurriedly got back in the car.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the front passenger seat. She rolled down the window to let in some fresh air and pulled out a pack of soft Zhonghua cigarettes. She flicked the lighter in her hand, turning the act of lighting a cigarette into a display akin to playing with a small knife. With a crisp click, the cigarette lit up. She took a deep drag, finally feeling like her soul had settled back into place.
 

 
Among her many personalities, only a few were addicted to smoking—Duan Ge was one of them.
 

 
After all, the mental stress of surviving the apocalypse was overwhelming.
 

 
As Song Kaiyu's car drove into a tunnel, the surroundings darkened, leaving only the flickering flame between Tong Zhao's fingers. The light and shadow pulled her pale face into an oil-painting-like beauty, so stunning that the audience held their breath, once again reminded of how impossibly gorgeous this talented newcomer was.
 

 
However...
 

 
[Someone, give the boss a Huazi cigarette. .jpg]
 

 
[The boss smokes Zhonghua. .gif]
 

 
[Damn it, it's the member-exclusive privilege of posting animated gifs that won!]
 

 
This scene was truly stunning, prompting a popular influencer with over a million followers to casually share a Weibo post showcasing this breathtaking beauty.
 

 
@DramaLovingBoboRabbitv:
 

 
Give Brother Tong Zhao a Huazi cigarette /dog head emoji
 

 
[GIF]
 

 
Beauty is a universal currency, and with the production team riding the wave and buying some bot traffic, this GIF managed to latch onto the tail end of the trending list, stirring up some minor buzz and attracting more netizens to pay for the live viewing privileges.
 

 
Back to the car interior.
 

 
Sitting in the back seat, Feng Sisi looked deeply worried. Song Kaiyu, who was driving, also had a pale face after seeing the tragic scenes along the way. Only Tong Zhao, after finishing her cigarette, kept gazing out the window, lost in thought. The streets were eerily quiet, with scattered remains of bodies that had been devoured, and the smell of blood lingering in the air. With Tong Zhao's consent, Song Kaiyu closed all the windows.
 

 
"If I smell that stench any longer, I’m going to throw up," Song Kaiyu said with a wry smile.
 

 
The three of them headed back together, only to find that the residential apartment complex had already become a playground for rampaging zombies.
 

 
Tong Zhao quietly observed outside the apartment for a while and then made her judgment: "If water is the primary source of contamination, then Dad and Mom wouldn't have escaped the first wave. With our current combat ability, barging in would only add three more casualties. The priority now is to find the antidote that person mentioned. If Mom and Dad are still alive, as long as they stay indoors, the food at home should last for three days."
 

 
From the omniscient perspective, the audience felt that Tong Zhao made a lot of sense.
 

 
[Seems like the director wasn't wrong—Tong Zhao is quite clever.]
 

 
[The one who laughs last in palace intrigues can't possibly be a fool. The emperor is scarier than zombies, after all.]
 

 
[This is so strange. Tong Zhao's 'id' doesn't seem to plan on relying on the male lead at all. Oh, and isn't Tang Jingjie kind of just playing a background role here...]
 

 
While Sister Tang was anxiously explaining, another person also grew agitated.
 

 
Feng Sisi's eyes were red like a rabbit's, filled with tears as she shook her head, "I won't feel at ease if I can't see Mom. Sis, can't you just try? How can you say Mom is gone without even trying? How can you leave her behind?"
 

 
Xu Zhu grew up relying on her mother since she was little, and subconsciously, she cared about her mother the most.
 

 
Tong Zhao cared too.
 

 
At any given time, Duan Ge would always make the most rational decision that maximizes benefits, ensuring the survival group could go further. Even now, as she fits into the character template, she is no exception. She said, "We will come back to check on Mom's safety once we find the antidote. If she managed to avoid the first wave of the virus, she will probably need the antidote just like us."
 

 
These clear and logical words naturally calmed the viewers' minds.
 

 
From a god's-eye view, the audience is often quite demanding of the characters.
 

 
They want to see them stay composed in crises and make the right decisions with limited information.
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at Tong Zhao in disbelief but didn't refute her. She asked quietly, "Should we leave now?"
 

 
"Yes."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded her chin toward Song Kaiyu, "First, we need to find the location of the research lab, then head to the nearest gun store."
 

 
Hearing "gun store," Feng Sisi flinched a little.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't question her decision; he just asked while driving, "Yanqi, do you have a gun license? How come I didn't know?”
 

 
"I don't have one. Once we get some, I'll practice my aim. As long as I don't shoot at living people, it should be fine," Tong Zhao said.
 

 
While the internet was still working, Song Kaiyu downloaded a map of the entire city and drove to the nearest gun store. The store's door was wide open, and it was eerily silent. Feng Sisi refused to get out of the car no matter what. Tong Zhao didn't force her, nor did she ask Song Kaiyu to join her, as if she intended to act alone.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated for a moment but decided to follow her.
 

 
"If anything happens, call us on the phone," he reminded Feng Sisi, who was staying in the car.
 

 
"Can't someone stay with me?" she asked, feeling a bit abandoned.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
It was already dangerous enough for Tong Zhao to go alone. Just as Song Kaiyu was about to refuse, Tong Zhao spoke first:
 

 
"Sure, whatever you want."
 

 
Tong Zhao had her hands in her pockets, looking indifferent.
 

 
With that, she turned around and walked into the gun store. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth, showing a look of suppressed fear, and followed her inside.
 

 
Rows of guns covered an entire wall. The two moved quietly, one in front of the other, but Song Kaiyu noticed that no matter how careful he was, he couldn't move as silently as Tong Zhao.
 

 
After making a round in the store and confirming there were no living people or zombies, they relaxed and began to search for usable weapons. Tong Zhao advised, "Don't get too greedy; you can't chew what you can't swallow. Ever played PUBG? Pick something simple and easy to use... And put down that sniper rifle. I don't want to see you using a sniper to go face-to-face with zombies."
 

 
Song Kaiyu awkwardly put down the sniper rifle he had taken a liking to.
 

 
Tong Zhao was feeling a SCAR rifle, her expression thoughtful. "I don't know why, but when I touch these guns, they feel strangely familiar. I feel like I could use them right away."
 

 
Song Kaiyu asked, "Huh? Why?"
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, "Maybe it's because I'm a gym teacher."
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn't quite get the logic behind that, but he took advantage of the lighter mood to quickly thank his girlfriend. "Thanks for saving me back at the gas station. Otherwise, I’d probably be dead by now."
 

 
"No need to thank me; just don’t take up my PE class time anymore."
 

 
"..."
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
As Tong Zhao was loading bullets, a door was gently pushed open. Song Kaiyu, alert, aimed his gun toward the source of the sound.
 

 
In the dimly lit gun shop, his sharp silhouette made the barrage of comments explode with excitement—finally, the male lead from all those PUBG fanfics had a face.
 

 
But his coolness lasted less than three seconds. The gun in his hand sank as Tong Zhao grabbed the barrel, pushing it downward. "You haven’t loaded any bullets yet; no need to aim. That's a living person. Are you the shopkeeper? The door was locked just now. We mean no harm. Can we talk?"
 

 
Out of the storage room came a small round face wearing glasses.
 

 
The three of them kept a safe distance from each other as they began their negotiation—
 

 
Well, it was less a negotiation and more of Tong Zhao's one-sided questioning.
 

 
The round-faced girl introduced herself as Anna. She claimed to be a janitor who had escaped from the research institute. While slacking off at work, she overheard information about the dangers of drug research and decided to run away. Because she usually drank only bottled water and had boxes of Evian stockpiled at home, she assumed she would be safe as long as she hadn’t touched tap water. However, after seeing a video posted by the doctor, she panicked and hid in her cousin’s shop.
 

 
She had been hiding in the storage room earlier and only dared to come out when she saw another young woman was traveling with the man.
 

 
“The city is already in chaos. Zombies are dangerous, and living people aren’t safe either,” Anna said. “You want to go find the antidote? That's impossible. The research institute has a fully enclosed security system and laser corridors. Anyway, the doctor was right. We won't get far even if we try to escape…”
 

 
Saying this, Anna began to sob softly.
 

 
“Since you worked at the research institute, you should be very familiar with its layout. You’ll guide us when the time comes,” Tong Zhao said, naturally patting her head. “I’ll handle everything.”
 

 
“Miss Feng…”
 

 
Anna looked at the slender and tall Oriental woman with gratitude.
 

 
Tong Zhao replied, “At worst, we’ll die.”
 

 
Her words extinguished the sentiment like a gust of wind scattering ashes.
# Chapter16
Tong Zhao gained Anna's trust with just a few words.
 

 
Firstly, women who are often seen as sexual resources in extreme environments tend to trust other women more.
 

 
Secondly, it was Tong Zhao's body language.
 

 
She exuded a calm confidence, whether she was scavenging for weapons or interrogating Anna. The other Oriental man also seemed to follow her instructions readily. Anna had no hesitation in positioning herself as a subordinate, and after being patted on the head, her sense of security skyrocketed.
 

 
At the same time, Feng Sisi wasn’t as fortunate.
 

 
A zombie had stumbled over, seemingly noticing the commotion inside the vehicle. The wobbly zombie pressed its half-decayed face against the car window, rubbing it inquisitively. Feng Sisi was terrified, her hands trembling as she held her phone, unable to stabilize her attempt to call her sister for help. Her panicked noise only drew the zombie’s attention further, causing it to bang more aggressively on the window.
 

 
Just as Feng Sisi was on the verge of losing control, the zombie pressing against the window suddenly jerked backward.
 

 
Upon closer inspection—
 

 
It turned out that Tong Zhao had grabbed the zombie by the hair, slammed it to the ground, and then used a crowbar to smash its head.
 

 
[Victimized Zombie +1]
 

 
[Damn, the Empress's fight scenes are so cool! I want to see her in physical palace battles!]
 

 
[So Tong Zhao also knows the wonders of physical combat! Overjoyed and dancing >////<]
 

 
Audience members who watch apocalyptic survival movies generally seek visual thrills and exploration of human nature and strategic thinking in extreme environments, and Tong Zhao delivers on this visual spectacle. She is like a beautiful and graceful berserker, with every move displaying an aesthetic of precision and efficiency. Her actions, though not choreographed, feel more genuine and thrilling!
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao, Feng Sisi, with red eyes, cried out:
 

 
"Why did you only just arrive? I almost died!"
 

 
Before exposing the truth and tearing her face, Xu Zhu and Tong Zhao attended middle and high school together. If anyone bullied her, as long as she sought Tong Zhao’s help, she would always rescue her from dire straits. Even the ungrateful Tong Father once remarked that the bond between them, mother and daughter, was exceptionally loyal and caring toward friends.
 

 
In contrast, after experiencing multiple worlds in quick succession and going through several reincarnations, Tong Zhao’s perspective is different. From Xu Zhu's point of view, they had only fallen out less than a year ago. Before that, whenever she sought Tong Zhao’s help, it was always with the expectation of being rescued.
 

 
Thus, the audience witnessed her authoritative demeanor in action.
 

 
“The zombies' strength is only slightly greater than that of ordinary people, but a barehanded one can't break a car window. You weren't in immediate danger, and I didn't receive your call for help; I was just handling some business. This staff member who escaped from the research institute can provide us with information on the routes inside.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s expression was indifferent as if she were dealing with a younger sister’s unreasonable tantrum.
 

 
The person involved, Anna, cowered behind Tong Zhao and weakly raised her hand: “Sorry, it’s my fault for delaying things…”
 

 
“You didn’t do anything wrong. No need to apologize.”
 

 
Tong Zhao cut off her apology, her tone still cold.
 

 
Feng Sisi, already on edge, was even more upset. She glanced at Anna and then stared in disbelief at Tong Zhao. Seeing that Tong Zhao had no intention of comforting her, she shouted, “Yes, she’s not at fault. It’s my fault for not getting killed by the zombies just now!” After yelling, she turned her head away and refused to engage.
 

 
After getting back in the car, Anna, unable to contain her curiosity, asked quietly, “Miss Feng, you were so cool when you took down the zombies earlier. Is that what Chinese martial arts look like? Are you a master at a martial arts school?”
 

 
……
 

 
[Indeed, the foreigner's “true self” is very on point.]
 

 
[No, no, no, not every Chinese person is as skilled as the empress. She’s just a master of palace intrigue.]
 

 
[Which school of palace intrigue is this? You, Empress Liyang from Yanxi Palace; me, Ip Man of Wing Chun.]
 

 
Tong Zhao waved her hand: “No, I’m just an ordinary physical education teacher.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu recalled something: “But it seems like you’ve been teaching Tai Chi recently?”
 

 
[No, shut up, Kaiyu. The misunderstanding with the foreign friend is really hard to clear up!]
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a cold look: “Yes, but my class time was taken up by too many other things. Since the school year started, I've only taught up to ‘White Crane Spreads Its Wings.’”
 

 
Hearing the familiar pronunciation of “Tai Chi” from kung fu movies, Anna's eyes lit up, increasingly convinced that Tong Zhao was a hidden expert in Chinese martial arts. She leaned in secretly and asked softly if she was a student of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought for a moment: “If I had to say, my style is more like Chen Haonan’s.”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Two traditional film actors suffer from reputation damage!]
 

 
[All I can say is, you’re both brave enough to ask and answer.]
 

 
The audience was laughing uncontrollably, not expecting an apocalypse movie to have such humor, and even more surprised that Tong Zhao’s subconscious could be such a deadpan comedian—
 

 
Her comedic effect in *The Emperor Ming's Story* was not this good!
 

 
It was strange.
 

 
How had she become so witty and sharp-tongued in such a short time?
 

 
The segment titled "The Confusing Exchange Between Chinese and Foreign Friends' True Selves" was cut out by the overjoyed publicity team and prepared for promotion by several paid marketing accounts. They didn’t expect that collaborating with Tong Zhao would be so enjoyable, with promotional material practically handed to them, leaving them with no worries.
 

 
Compared to the unreasonable and troublesome second female lead, Feng Sisi, the audience surprisingly liked the blonde, round-faced Anna more and looked forward to seeing her interactions with Tong Zhao.
 

 
Outside the show, the director sighed: “Xu Zhu didn’t grasp the cute aspects of her character, but Anna’s natural performance was very charming.”
 

 
“It was an accidental bonus. Anna was originally just a supporting role,” said the screenwriter.
 

 
To ensure the plot stayed on track and smoothly reached its conclusion, the screenwriter avoided creating impossible situations.
 

 
Anna, who escaped from the research institute, served as a tool to provide information on the institute’s layout, greatly reducing the difficulty of the high-risk strategy. Otherwise, with an average person’s capabilities, it would be extremely difficult to tackle the stringent and dangerous security systems of the research institute.
 

 
While chatting, a change occurred within the scene.
 

 
On the way to the research institute, they passed by a public restroom. Feng Sisi, who had been trying to maintain her aloof demeanor, couldn't hold it anymore and repeatedly said she needed to use the restroom: “Sister, you have to come with me this time.”
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her.
 

 
Anna timidly raised her hand: “Sorry, I also need to go…”
 

 
“Let’s go together.”
 

 
Tong Zhao got out of the car, intending to check it out first. The two girls, who had been holding it in under high pressure, rushed in as if granted amnesty. They had been holding it in for so long that as soon as they saw the restroom, they couldn’t hold it any longer.
 

 
Typically, at such times, smart AI would only provide a distant shot of the public restroom and footage of hand-washing. However, this time the camera followed them in and experienced viewers immediately sensed an imminent crisis.
 

 
Sure enough, when Feng Sisi pushed open the door to the last stall, a zombie that had been roused by the noise turned around and lunged at her—
 

 
Feng Sisi screamed, but her first reaction wasn’t to step back or dodge.
 

 
Instinctively, she pulled Anna, who was about to enter the adjacent stall, in front of herself!
 

 
“Sister, help me, sister!”
 

 
“Ah—”
 

 
The blonde, round-faced Anna was thrown into the zombie’s mouth, screaming in pain as a large wound was gnawed into her delicate white neck.
 

 
……
 

 
[What is this?]
 

 
[Feng Sisi is crazy! How could she be so selfish? She’s lost her mind!]
 

 
[Is there still a chance? Without Anna, how will we get into the research institute to find the antidote?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the filming set.
 

 
Director: “Props team, who put that zombie there for the door-kill scene!?”
 

 
The props team, feeling aggrieved, explained: “I lowered the zombie’s movement speed data. She just needed to dodge it. Who would have thought she’d pull Anna in front of it? Should I air-drop a map of the research institute now?”
 

 
“I want to air-drop you right now!”
 

 
The director was furious.
 

 
The situation was serious.
 

 
With the key supporting character dead, how would the main characters get into the research institute?
# Chapter17
At the moment the scream rang out, Tong Zhao charged in.
 

 
She moved swiftly, delivering a precise high kick that sent the zombie crashing against the wall. Then, using a crowbar, she smashed the zombie's head to bits, ensuring it could no longer pose any threat. Only then did she turn to embrace the falling Anna. Blood gushed from Anna’s neck wound, which had been bitten, and she tried to speak, but her shattered throat could only produce incoherent sounds.
 

 
Feng Sisi, originally worried that she might be exposed, felt a vague sense of relief upon seeing this scene.
 

 
"Sis, I-I didn’t expect there to be a zombie inside, and Anna was attacked..."
 

 
Feng Sisi, feeling both guilty and frightened, weakly showed her fear to her sister, her mind still reeling.
 

 
They were real sisters, after all; her sister surely wouldn’t turn against her over someone she had only recently met!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn't respond but simply stared fixedly at Feng Sisi.
 

 
The director used the eye-tracking system to switch the camera angles, allowing the audience to see where Tong Zhao's gaze was focused at that moment:
 

 
First on Feng Sisi's eyes, then on the location where the zombie had fallen, and finally on Anna's expression, which was beginning to freeze.
 

 
Through this sequence of camera shots, most of the audience understood.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Anna's death had some hidden aspects.
 

 
[On one side is protecting her sister, and on the other side is a stranger she has just met—she would probably see through it but choose to keep quiet.]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Xu Zhu’s true self is so selfish. However, I’m quite interested. Such a cruel and selfish person should be very intriguing on a talent show. I want to catch up on "Star Selection Girls" now.]
 

 
[I came from "Star Selection Girls," where I was into her sweet and soft princess persona. I can't accept this change... I'm unfollowing. Compared to her, Tong Zhao and this foreign actor are much more likable and charming.]
 

 
[Speechless!! I was into the sisterly Yuri dynamic based on the plot setup, but with the younger sister being so toxic, I can’t keep up with it.]
 

 
How Tong Zhao will handle this unexpected development has become a major dilemma.
 

 
Killing someone demands a price, but Feng Sisi's crime is rather subtle.
 

 
Moreover, it would be strange for the sister to actually kill her.
 

 
If she lets her off lightly, the audience's perception of Tong Zhao will also become subtle.
 

 
The key point is—
 

 
It’s inherently inappropriate for Tong Zhao to act as a judge.
 

 
Why should she?
 

 
Yet, she’s the only one who can make this judgment. Given her previous demeanor and actions, pretending not to notice would only lead to the audience, who stand on moral high ground and love to make cold comments, steering the narrative. In this era of instinct-driven cinema, even villains and shameless people can have fan appeal. The worst is a muddled, indecisive, and mediocre personality.
 

 
It wasn’t Tong Zhao’s fault, but she had to take the fall.
 

 
Tong Zhao pushed away the zombie, closed the toilet lid, placed the nearly dead Anna on top, and adjusted Anna’s head to face the right way.
 

 
As the audience wondered what Tong Zhao was going to do, she cast a cold glance at Feng Sisi.
 

 
“There’s not much time left.”
 

 
In the next moment, things took an unexpected turn.
 

 
Tong Zhao kicked Feng Sisi’s knee with precise force, making her collapse to the ground, her knee striking the dirty, cold floor. As Feng Sisi cried out in pain, Tong Zhao grabbed her by the back of the head and forcefully pressed it down.
 

 
“Sis, what are you doing... Sis... don’t kill me…”
 

 
“Who said I’m going to kill you? I’m not like you. Murder is a grave crime.”
 

 
The director zoomed in for a close-up of Feng Sisi and then cut to a medium shot of the whole scene. Tong Zhao was pressing Feng Sisi’s head to make her bow in front of Anna. Tong Zhao had also positioned Anna’s face to ensure she could see this moment clearly: “Apologize to her.”
 

 
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. I saw the zombie as soon as I opened the door. I was scared too!"
 

 
Feng Sisi sobbed uncontrollably.
 

 
"You were scared, you could have run away, you could have asked me for help. It's really hard to believe how you’ve changed. Feng Sisi, if you truly felt guilty, you wouldn’t have lied to me just now."
 

 
With her face pressed to the floor, Feng Sisi, her dignity shattered, shouted back, "I'm your sister! You want me to apologize to a stranger and even hit me! Who is the real sister here?"
 

 
Tong Zhao ignored her and continued to press her head down until Anna, having lost too much blood, finally passed away. Then, she pulled Feng Sisi off the floor and said, "Clean yourself up and get in the car."
 

 
Feng Sisi, quietly crying, used a tissue to wipe off the dirt. With the city's water supply contaminated, she dared not turn on the faucet to wash her face, fearing contamination through her mucous membranes. Her once-white forehead was now marked with red bruises, looking pitifully tragic and forlorn.
 

 
"You’re so frightening. I really didn’t do it on purpose..."
 

 
The close-up shot clearly captured Feng Sisi’s guilty expression.
 

 
"Alright, let's say it wasn't intentional,"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned around, sweeping her bangs back to reveal her smooth, full forehead. Her pale skin was almost translucent, accentuating her short, jet-black hair. Her cold, exquisite beauty momentarily made one forget their surroundings: "Someone died for you. Is it too much to ask for you to bow dozens of times in apology? Or do you want to die here like her?"
 

 
"With the blood supply to the retina being compromised from massive blood loss, Anna would soon experience dizziness and blindness. What did she feel seeing me before she died? Was she scared and helpless? My actions may seem extreme, but they were the only way to make her feel a little better in that moment."
 

 
In "The Story of Ming Emperor," Tong Zhao’s voice was soft and sweet, capable of infusing even the simplest phrases with a tender, lingering tone that stirred listeners’ hearts. On some male-dominated forums, quotes from Concubine Chen were even edited into standalone audio clips, with high download numbers.
 

 
But in "Countdown 72 Hours," the same voice was cold and sharp, with a slight rasp.
 

 
This time, female viewers found it quite satisfying.
 

 
Previously, while the audience enjoyed watching Tong Zhao's head-bowing actions, they also found it a bit strange.
 

 
After all, the female lead, Feng Yanqi, shouldn’t have such a personality.
 

 
People admire strength but also fear extreme violence.
 

 
But after Tong Zhao’s explanation, the emotional logic made sense. It highlighted her strength while still showing her softer, human side. A paranoid madman can be captivating in certain situations, but a warm, positive personality is the mainstream choice.
 

 
[Despite how brutal Tong Zhao was earlier, why do I feel she’s so warm?]
 

 
[I’ve become her fan! She’s so cool, absolutely amazing!]
 

 
[As an M, I really envy Feng Sisi...]
 

 
[I’ve already edited out the clip of Feng Sisi being forced to bow. I’m declaring it the most stress-relieving video of the year. Selfish people like her should be made to bow to Anna—bow hard and bow fiercely!]
 

 
Men are quick to solve their business in the restroom. Song Kaiyu, who was waiting in the car listening to music, was surprised to see only two people return when three had left. His girlfriend remained her usual calm self, while Feng Sisi looked particularly disheveled. Her eyes were as red as a rabbit's, clearly from crying, and her forehead was also bruised.
 

 
"What happened?"
 

 
Song Kaiyu, puzzled, took out iodine from the car's first aid kit and a bottle of mineral water, asking Feng Sisi to clean the wound on her forehead.
 

 
Feng Sisi gratefully accepted the items.
 

 
In response to Song Kaiyu’s questions, she shook her head, tears welling up at the corners of her eyes. She glanced at her sister with immense grievance, her feelings left unspoken.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t pay much attention to her performance and simply said, “Anna was attacked by a zombie in the restroom, and we couldn’t save her in time.”
 

 
Internal conflicts are detrimental to the whole team.
 

 
Under the pressing time and harsh conditions, Tong Zhao had no intention of delving further into the matter before finding the antidote.
 

 
Seeing that her sister didn’t expose her, Feng Sisi let out a quiet sigh of relief.
 

 
“Well, it can’t be helped. If I had known, I would have gone in with you. Let’s make sure we stick together next time, no matter what.” Song Kaiyu, who was unaware of the full truth, was deeply troubled. It was hard for him to accept that someone who had been with them moments ago was now dead. The sense of despair from the zombie outbreak overwhelmed him.
 

 
“Okay, Kaiyu, I’m really scared…”
 

 
The comfort she couldn’t find from her sister, she fully sought from Kaiyu.
 

 
Feng Sisi looked at him brightly.
 

 
Unfortunately, he was too preoccupied with mourning the loss of a teammate to notice her subtle advances.
 

 
He didn’t realize it, but the onlooking audience saw it all clearly.
 

 
[No way, is someone really trying to hit on the sister’s boyfriend? Did I misread the character setting? Is this really the timid and sweet younger sister? This is quite eye-opening.]
 

 
[It’s probably a case of desperation leading to a hasty solution. Is Tong Zhao’s “true self” really this bad at comforting people?]
 

 
[Huh? Are you kidding me? Tong Zhao wasn’t good enough? Every time a zombie appeared, she was the first to protect her teammates. If I were in a ranked game and encountered such a pro, I’d be scrambling to hug their leg and call them 'daddy.' Noobs who win by luck need someone to comfort them? Do they think they’re a princess or something?]
 

 
[Coming from "Star Selection Girls," I’m really disgusted...]
 

 
[This might be just instinct-driven cinema.]
 

 
Ordinary viewers were reflecting on human nature, while fans of Tang Jingjie were becoming agitated: [Monsters and demons stay away from my baby, Mama doesn’t approve of this marriage!]
 

 
[It’s normal to have a CP in acting, and being with the female lead is quite good—she can protect and take care of the baby.]
 

 
...
 

 
From similar comments, it’s clear that the proportion of Tang Jingjie’s fans who are his "mama fans" is extraordinarily high.
 

 
Back to the show.
 

 
From Tong Zhao’s calm analysis of the street, zombies are light-sensitive and will only be active indoors during the day. She instructed Song Kaiyu to avoid shaded areas while driving. Sure enough, when they passed under a bridge, they spotted a zombie lying on the road, asleep.
 

 
Just as the audience was praising the female lead for her intelligence and bravery, an off-road vehicle appeared, blocking their path.
 

 
“There are other survivors in the city!”
 

 
Song Kaiyu’s eyes lit up, and Feng Sisi also became alert.
 

 
She didn’t want to continue living under her sister’s control.
 

 
After causing the woman’s death, she felt her sister wouldn’t protect her unconditionally as she used to…
 

 
“Be careful, hold your gun steady,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, who had previously maintained a neutral expression, showed a slight change in her demeanor, without any joy at encountering other survivors.
 

 
Deep down, Tong Zhao’s intuition warned her that, in extreme conditions, living humans could be more dangerous than zombies…
 

 
Outside the show, the entire directing team was suddenly energized.
 

 
"Alright, alright, the plot is finally getting back on track."
 

 
The somewhat irrelevant screenwriter was deeply moved: "Is the conflict I designed finally going to be put to use?"
 

 
In the setting, even if people come into contact with contaminated sources, some individuals with unique genes or constitutions don’t die immediately but instead gradually turn into zombies, becoming increasingly malevolent in the last three days.
 

 
The main characters encounter a small group of villains.
 

 
In the face of the conflict, the male lead, Song Kaiyu, showed courage and responsibility, while Feng Sisi, as an intern nurse, treated their wounds afterward, demonstrating the "every member is useful, each with their own shining qualities" trope of typical mainstream drama...
 

 
An off-road vehicle aggressively stopped their car, and a muscular Black man got out with a hockey stick:
 

 
"Hand over your supplies and women!"
 

 
He keenly spotted the Asian girl in the passenger seat, his eyes lighting up.
 

 
A woman?
 

 
Tong Zhao raised an eyebrow: "Is he calling me?”
 

 
The three had been living abroad for some time and had encountered people of various qualities. They naturally did not judge others by skin color, but it was clear that the newcomer was hostile. Song Kaiyu gritted his teeth and said, "I will protect you..."
 

 
"I understand English. He’s asking the women to get out of the car."
 

 
Tong Zhao expertly chambered her gun and opened the car door. "Wait for me in the car.”
# Chapter18
"Yes, get out of the car, just like that..."
 

 
Seeing that the only man was staying in the car, Tong Zhao got out alone, and the thief showed a satisfied, sinister smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao exited the car slowly, so slowly that it should have attracted the attention of a professional.
 

 
Unfortunately...
 

 
The thief in front of her wasn’t a trained police officer or a seasoned gang member but just a thug who had survived a little longer in the virus outbreak. Since the main characters lacked special abilities, the screenwriter and template team wouldn’t set up overly harsh scenarios to force their death.
 

 
In reality, if the confrontation became too dire, the director would find ways to introduce some last-minute adjustments to turn the situation around.
 

 
The thief only saw half of Tong Zhao’s body.
 

 
As she was about to fully exit the car, she suddenly drew her gun and fired multiple shots aimed at his legs, turning them into a bloody mess in an instant!
 

 
"Oh, damn it, how dare this bitch, where did she get a gun…”
 

 
The thief cried out in pain and collapsed to the ground.
 

 
Seeing that he had lost his ability to move, Tong Zhao didn’t fire another shot at him but instead aimed at the remaining people in the off-road vehicle.
 

 
...
 

 
[Damn, the princess is so fierce.]
 

 
[I actually worried about Zhao for a moment there, sorry. Here’s a virtual cigarette for Zhao.]
 

 
[Victim 1, finally taking action against living people!]
 

 
A gust of wind blew, lifting Tong Zhao’s jet-black short hair and revealing her delicate, porcelain-like white face. In stark contrast to her earlier cold demeanor in the car, she now wore a triumphant smile: “If a hockey stick and a knife are your strongest weapons, then it's time for me to set the rules of the game. Everyone get out of the car!”
 

 
The thieves were stunned.
 

 
Feng Sisi was also frightened. She grabbed Song Kaiyu's arm, nearly in tears: “Oh my God, how could my sister anger those people? Couldn’t we have just given away some of our supplies? We already left a lot at the gas station... Did she really shoot at them?”
 

 
She still hoped for a peaceful resolution through negotiation.
 

 
Song Kaiyu hesitated but disagreed with her logic: “These people clearly aren’t good. It wouldn’t be solved just by giving up some supplies. Even if we gave everything, they might not spare us, and did you hear? They also want women.”
 

 
Feng Sisi was disheartened by his scolding.
 

 
Song Kaiyu kept his eyes fixed on the off-road vehicle, gripping his small gun tightly: “I need to find a way to help Yanqi…”
 

 
The ideal situation would be cooperation among multiple people.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the attacker, with two teammates in the car providing fire support. Unfortunately, their shooting skills were poor; they could barely manage blind shooting at zombies. It was unrealistic to expect them to accurately hit enemies during close combat. Tong Zhao didn’t want to risk being shot by her teammates, so she gave up on relying on them.
 

 
But she still handed the gun to her boyfriend, investing in a potential asset.
 

 
“Bitch!”
 

 
The accomplices in the car cursed, and a dark hole appeared. Tong Zhao shouted for everyone to get down, using the car as cover, and clenched her teeth: “Get out of the car, we have to fight them!”
 

 
Their vehicle had gasoline, and if it exploded, everyone inside would be done for.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t immediately think of this and, believing his girlfriend needed help, got out of the car without hesitation. Only Feng Sisi stayed inside the car, hiding from the bullets and refusing to come out.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her, but squeezed next to Tong Zhao: “Is there anything I can do?”
 

 
Tong Zhao pulled a cigarette from her pocket: “Light this for me.”
 

 
...
 

 
Song Kaiyu quickly used a lighter to ignite the cigarette in her mouth.
 

 
“Alright, I’ll rush out and kill them all. Don’t shoot randomly. If I get restrained, you start shooting. I’ll try to turn his body towards you... Got it?”
 

 
“Understood.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu nodded quickly.
 

 
Tong Zhao examined him for a moment more, making sure he truly understood, before giving a slight nod.
 

 
The thieves continued to threaten, but upon seeing that the Asians were armed, they dared not rush in easily, resulting in a standoff.
 

 
Then, Tong Zhao heard the sound of an engine starting.
 

 
Her pupils contracted—
 

 
In a situation where they had inferior firepower, using the off-road vehicle to try and ram Song Kaiyu's ordinary car was a viable strategy. She indeed had no time left; how could she physically confront a vehicle? She wasn't a superhero.
 

 
She had to rely on the thieves' poor shooting skills, and their lack of ruthlessness compared to hers.
 

 
When the narrow path meets, the brave prevail!
 

 
"I'm going.”
 

 
Tong Zhao darted out, crouching to minimize her target area.
 

 
She didn't just rush out; she also fired her gun continuously to cover her advance. The situation unfolded as she had expected. In their panic, even though the robbers emptied their bullets, their accuracy was atrocious. By the time Tong Zhao charged into the vehicle, they had only managed to hit her thigh...
 

 
[Tong Zhao went all out!]
 

 
[Damn, slow-motion, slow-motion, I need to see this in slow-mo!]
 

 
[Give up… Slow-motion can only be watched with a purchase, oh my god, Tong Zhao's real self is so brave… Did the director implant combat skills into her memory? But such life-or-death courage can't be simulated by a template… I'm starting to get curious about the actor herself.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is amazing!!! (Very loud)]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s Superman-like performance completely conquered the audience.
 

 
“Damn…”
 

 
Even Superman can bleed and feel pain. She furrowed her brow and let out the first curse word spoken by the protagonist in the series. The remaining robbers, barely clinging to life, stared at this Eastern girl with a face younger than most white high school students with confusion and suspicion: “Who exactly are you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave them a cold glance.
 

 
With severe injuries and blood loss, the robbers' vision began to blur, and they could only see a flickering flame.
 

 
She exhaled a smoke ring and smiled: “Wing Chun.”
 

 
……
 

 
[……Hey!]
 

 
[The stereotype that all Chinese people know martial arts is hard to shake.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s teasing made me really happy :D]
 

 
“I’m just kidding; I’m actually a high school PE teacher,” Tong Zhao said, patting one of the big men’s faces, ash falling onto his nose. “You ended up in this situation because you didn’t study hard enough back in the day. Now, let me give you your last lesson.”
 

 
“Damn, the thing I hate most in life is teachers… How could a teacher possibly have such good marksmanship…”
 

 
“Maybe it’s because I had extra time after being forced to take English, math, physics, and chemistry classes, so I used that time to practice shooting.”
 

 
This was a made-up story.
 

 
There was no such plot setting.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually stubbed out the cigarette on his arm: “We Chinese believe in reincarnation. Remember to be a good person in your next life, attend classes properly, and respect women.”
 

 
She poked her head out and waved to her teammates: “Come over here.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu hurried over.
 

 
“Move the bodies from the car and bring over the supplies. We’re switching to this vehicle; it’s more durable.”
 

 
The headlights were smashed when the SUV forced them to stop earlier, and Tong Zhao didn’t want to leave any safety hazards. Plus, the SUV was better at resisting zombie attacks. Song Kaiyu was dazed by the first sentence, but since he had just said he would find a way to help his girlfriend, he gritted his teeth and carried on.
 

 
He asked quietly, “Yanqi, aren’t you scared?”
 

 
[It’s likely that our boss, Zhao, isn’t afraid of mere mortal emotions.]
 

 
[One cigarette, boundless magical power.]
 

 
[555555 The little one must be very scared. Hugs to our little hero.]
 

 
Tong Zhao sat in the passenger seat of the SUV, the car’s dim light casting a glow on her nose and lips. In an instant, she looked cold and beautiful, almost unearthly, like a knife quietly shining in the dark. How could a knife have fearful emotions?
 

 
“I’m afraid. Why wouldn’t I be?”
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze to him, her eyes having been tested under close-up scrutiny:
 

 
“I’m afraid of death, afraid of pain, and of course, afraid of zombies. I fear everything a normal person would fear, but my emotions can be separated from my actions. I want to survive, and ideally, I want everyone to survive with me.”
 

 
For some reason, when she said the last sentence, Tong Zhao sounded unusually resolute.
 

 
One reason is that Duan Ge’s mission in the apocalypse scenario was to save specific characters. The second reason is that Duan Ge is one of the kinder personalities in Tong Zhao.
 

 
Because Duan Ge had witnessed cruelty and misfortune in the apocalypse scenario, she deeply understood the bright, warm, and soft aspects of human nature. That’s why Tong Zhao was confident in having her play the role in the film. Duan Ge would neither be an annoying saint nor a terrifying villain.
 

 
She could be ruthless in combat, but her underlying personality is gentle.
 

 
After hearing this, Song Kaiyu was speechless.
 

 
He was overwhelmed with regret.
 

 
How could he have asked such a rude question, “Aren’t you afraid?” just because his girlfriend seemed strong? Yan Qi, like him, was a human who feared pain and death, but she endured her fear to protect him and to survive.
 

 
The audience shared his thoughts.
 

 
From the start of the broadcast, Tong Zhao's portrayal had been that of a tough, no-nonsense heroine, who shows no fear. While they enjoyed the thrill and felt the show was worth the price, there was a sense of distance. After all, gods and humans are different, and the killing god was impressive.
 

 
When Tong Zhao admitted her fear, she transformed from a deity into a human.
 

 
It wasn’t that she was no longer impressive, but rather that the audience could now empathize with her.
 

 
On the barrage, fewer people were calling her "Empress," and more were starting to refer to her as "Zhao-ge," with some even calling her "Wife" and "Zhao-cub"—
 

 
Song Kaiyu gave her a long look, his eyes reddened as he awkwardly turned away. “I’ll go get our stuff.”
 

 
“Okay, bring me the makeup bag from the car.”
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
[Makeup bag 23333 It’s true that wanting to look good is a woman’s nature.]
 

 
[The empress who wouldn't step out without new clothes is back!]
 

 
Song Kaiyu thought, just like the barrage, that Tong Zhao wanted to do her makeup and found her cute, so he smiled slightly. He worried that the items in her bag might not be enough, so he asked Feng Sisi, who had been hiding in the backseat pretending to be dead, “Can I borrow the makeup bag? Your sister needs it.”
 

 
Feng Sisi stared at him in disbelief. “What time is it, and she’s still thinking about makeup?”
 

 
After speaking, she remembered that she should also touch up her makeup and mumbled, “No, I need to use mine. Just use hers.”
 

 
The audience was used to this selfish behavior from the younger sister.
 

 
Some even noted her lines as the most classic example of a petty “true self” for the second half of the year.
 

 
Song Kaiyu didn’t force her and hurriedly handed the makeup bag to Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
She lit another cigarette, still holding it between her lips.
 

 
Can a woman do her makeup while smoking? The audience grew a bit curious.
 

 
At this point, Song Kaiyu had already started to reluctantly move the bodies from the car. He deserved some screen time, but Tong Zhao’s next action immediately drew the attention of the AI, and the director couldn’t bear to cut away the shot—
 

 
Tong Zhao cut open a section of her shorts, revealing the area where she had been shot.
 

 
That piece of snow-white skin had already turned into an ugly, bright red.
# Chapter19
Inside the off-road vehicle’s cargo area.
 

 
Tong Zhao, with a blank expression, took the eyebrow tweezers from the makeup bag and used a lighter to sterilize them before using them on her wound…
 

 
In instinctual films, some memories can be erased and not brought into reality.
 

 
Certain memories of torture and bed scenes, after being reviewed by professionals, are selectively erased to prevent psychological trauma for the actors. Conversely, when actors need to perform difficult action scenes, they might be given a certain level of pain exemption to boost their courage.
 

 
In instinctual films, characters only perceive it as “adrenaline kicking in” or “the pain isn’t as bad as expected.” However, *Countdown 72 Hours* doesn’t involve such high difficulty levels, so pain exemptions were never applied to the actors.
 

 
When pain exemptions are granted, the percentage is also displayed in the film.
 

 
This can be seen as a form of recognition for particularly resilient actors. Some tough male actors take pride in this, and those who endure pain above level III without exemptions often form their own small circles in WeChat groups, sharing resources and recommendations.
 

 
Mature actresses scoffed at this, saying who hasn’t experienced level IV pain?
 

 
In any case, there are currently no female actresses in this small group.
 

 
“How much of a pain exemption should be granted to Tong Zhao?”
 

 
The staff asked.
 

 
The director, focusing intently on the screen, had access to an actor’s various status indicators in an area unseen by the audience. This allows the director to detect and prevent any potential breakdowns before the actor does.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal status panel…
 

 
Was surprisingly normal.
 

 
“Don’t rush to apply the exemption. Let’s observe for now,” the director said.
 

 
The wound did not contain a complete bullet; Tong Zhao removed all the metal fragments without even furrowing her brow. The only sign of her true pain was the sweat covering her forehead and the fact that she smoked two more cigarettes.
 

 
Close up, sweat beads fell from Tong Zhao’s high-bridged nose, creating a beautiful arc that made one’s heart tremble.
 

 
The director gave her many close-ups, and she handled the intense camera work well. Despite her immense pain, her light-colored eyes occasionally lost focus and her breathing became labored. In stark contrast, her hands moved with an emotional detachment, meticulously removing each metal shard from her flesh and tossing them aside with frustration before applying a simple bandage from the off-road vehicle's first aid kit.
 

 
During this process, Song Kaiyu, who was transporting supplies, noticed her treating her own wound. Shocked and heartbroken, he hesitated to speak, afraid of disturbing her. Timing it carefully, he handed her a bottle of opened mineral water, a small packet of bread, and a small pack of sugar to replenish her energy after she finished bandaging her wound.
 

 
“Thanks.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the mineral water and chugged it down.
 

 
“Drink slowly, be careful not to choke.”
 

 
Seeing her drink hurriedly, Song Kaiyu attentively handed her a tissue and opened the small packet of bread for her.
 

 
This scene…
 

 
He looked just like a gentle and virtuous girlfriend!
 

 
“What’s there to thank me for?” Song Kaiyu chuckled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, accepted his logic, and smiled at him, saying, “I was wrong.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile was very gentle. In this film, she smiled rarely, and when she did, it was often in a wild, over-the-top way during fight scenes, as if she was about to say ‘Why so serious?’ This tender smile was like a refreshing spring, so sweet it melted the audience’s hearts.
 

 
[Wow, wow, I finally feel the chemistry between the male and female leads after all this time!]
 

 
[The female lead looks so adorable when she smiles!]
 

 
[I’m officially a fan of Zhao Bao now!!]
 

 
[Guys can admire too.]
 

 
Song Kaiyu was momentarily stunned by her smile.
 

 
In their character relationship set up, they were a couple. Tang Jingjie had no ill feelings toward her personally and had been treating her as his girlfriend since getting into character. Now, moved by her smile, he straightforwardly held her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t refuse but looked at the hand being held with some confusion.
 

 
In the apocalypse scenario, there were no male characters to pursue. Apart from protecting specific female characters, Duan Ge had never been in a romantic relationship, leading to a near-innocent clumsiness in handling romantic matters. To put it simply…
 

 
“Are you scared?”
 

 
Tong Zhao clasped his hand in return: “Don’t be afraid; I’m here.”
 

 
??
 

 
??
 

 
The audience was filled with question marks.
 

 
What are you talking about?
 

 
Although you’re very brave, isn’t that the male lead’s line?
 

 
It’s enough; everyone already knows you’re super brave. Let the male lead have a break!
 

 
And because Tang Jingjie’s personality is gentle, without the big-man ego of Wan Zhuo, his portrayal of Song Kaiyu smoothly accepted this setting and bumped heads with her: “It’s really reassuring to have you by my side.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was quite pleased.
 

 
It felt great to be trusted by a companion.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was also happy; his girlfriend was so strong and gave him a strong sense of security.
 

 
Only the scriptwriter was unhappy.
 

 
The scriptwriter repeatedly banged his head against the director's tropical fish tank: “Reverse CP! Reverse CP!”
 

 
The innocent tropical fish, clueless about what was happening, scattered in fear.
 

 
※
 

 
Feng Sisi noticed that no one came to persuade her to change cars and saw that the supplies had been moved. Fearing that her sister would abandon her, she walked over with a look of grievance. When she climbed into the SUV, she found the two of them cuddling together, and the warm atmosphere made her feel a pang of sadness.
 

 
It's not that she likes her brother-in-law that much.
 

 
It’s just that, seeing her sister so wronged and distressed, how can others be happy while leaving her out?
 

 
"Brother Kaiyu, are you hurt?"
 

 
Feng Sisi, noticing the bloodstains on the ground and the bandages in the trash can, rushed over anxiously: “Sis, let me see. I didn’t waste my time interning at the hospital; I do know a bit of first aid…”
 

 
“Uh,” Song Kaiyu stopped her outstretched hand and continued speaking: “I’m not hurt. By the time we got in the car, those robbers were already dead. It’s your sister who got shot in the thigh. She just used tweezers to extract the bullet fragments.”
 

 
……
 

 
This was quite awkward.
 

 
[Let the injured person take a look, Feng Sisi, you’re really something.]
 

 
[Help, my embarrassment is acting up. I really want to skip the parts with her and just watch the female lead solo.]
 

 
[To be honest, Feng Sisi is just like a useless accessory and even got Miss Anna killed.]
 

 
In all artistic works, people naturally dislike those who hold them back.
 

 
Moreover, Feng Sisi’s performance not only shows her lack of insight and usefulness but also lacks the traits of kindness and gentleness. She isn't a major villain but reveals selfish details in the finer points.
 

 
The sense of immersion is too strong.
 

 
We don’t get to see villains who are ruthless in real life, but who hasn’t encountered self-righteous and selfish people in everyday life?
 

 
However, it’s not entirely a negative evaluation.
 

 
A comment [I won't watch face-slapping dramas without Xu Zhu as the villain; that bowing scene was so relieving] received 99 likes, indicating that sometimes, the most seemingly insignificant roles can stand out and be appreciated.
 

 
"Sis, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were hurt.”
 

 
Feng Sisi, knowing she was in the wrong, apologized hesitantly.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t even glance at her, opening the window and lighting a cigarette: “Let’s head to the research institute. Don’t waste time.”
 

 
Seeing that her sister was ignoring her, Feng Sisi finally panicked.
 

 
In the current situation, she had no one else to rely on besides her sister. Her previous words had a hint of living off her sister’s kindness, but since she accidentally caused Anna’s death, she felt her sister’s attitude had completely changed.
 

 
She tried to boost her favorability: “Sis, you should smoke less; it’s bad for your health.”
 

 
“Not smoking hurts.”
 

 
The camera captured Tong Zhao’s cold and refined features as if sculpted by wind and snow, immaculate and noble.
 

 
Feng Sisi was taken aback: “Huh?”
 

 
“Not smoking will hurt your mouth,” Tong Zhao clarified.
 

 
Feng Sisi fell silent, finally realizing, just a little, how selfish she had been and that she had never truly paid attention to the suffering her sister had endured.
 

 
She secretly felt relieved that her sister was always there to protect her from such physical suffering.
 

 
As nightfall approached, Tong Zhao insisted on finding a place to hide and stay as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the zombies’ attention.
 

 
Although Feng Sisi was eager to obtain the antidote as soon as possible, she dared not oppose her sister's wishes.
 

 
Soon, the changing environment confirmed that Tong Zhao’s approach was correct.
 

 
After night fell, the city became a playground for zombies. Even the slightest sound would draw their attention. The three of them hid in the car, remaining so quiet that not a single word was spoken. Feng Sisi, terrified by the sight of zombies roaming outside the car window, quietly edged closer to Tong Zhao in the darkness.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t sleep well.
 

 
With Feng Sisi on her right and Song Kaiyu on her left, how could she possibly get any rest?
 

 
This cozy scene gave the behind-the-scenes staff a sense of satisfaction as if the plot had finally gotten back on track.
 

 
Screenwriter: "Don’t get too excited. How will you get into the research institute without Anna’s fingerprint?"
 

 
Screenwriter: "And there’s a whole series of deadly traps inside. The female lead is injured... Do you think these two are useful? Maybe it's better to take the chance now to lower the difficulty inside the research institute and just have them walk straight into a ‘Grand Opening Free Antidote Giveaway’ event?"
 

 
The others glanced at him, concluding that he was rambling due to the chaos caused by the altered plot.
 

 
"No need to lower the difficulty just yet. I want to see how far the female lead can go in this apocalypse live show."
 

 
A male voice cut in, and everyone in the backstage immediately put down their work and turned to the source of the voice, including the director, who gave a respectful look: “Supervisor.”
 

 
The man referred to as the supervisor was about twenty-five years old, strikingly handsome, with tea-colored eyes that gave him a slightly stern appearance. He wore a long black trench coat, jeans, and combat boots, moving as if he had his own background music and wind.
 

 
"She’s very interesting."


 
The supervisor’s gaze fell on the screen, where Tong Zhao’s face, flushed with fever, was visible.
 

 
The female lead had a fever.
# Chapter20
Tong Zhao's sleeping face captured the audience’s attention.
 

 
The girl, who had been resolute and formidable like a war deity since the broadcast began, suddenly showed signs of vulnerability, making people feel even more pity and sympathy for her. One of the advantages of live broadcasts in instinct films is that both your strengths and weaknesses are visible to the audience. If you have the talent, it will shine.
 

 
With each cough, her long eyelashes fluttered lightly—
 

 
With such beauty, why endure such suffering?
 

 
Many viewers felt a pang of sorrow upon seeing this scene, and even the backstage staff were no exception. Only the cold-hearted screenwriter proudly revealed the truth: "The faster the heartbeat, the quicker the virus spreads in the blood. Combined with her injury and lowered immunity, her blood virus concentration should be higher than others."
 

 
"…"
 

 
Everyone turned to look at him.
 

 
"These are things Anna would have originally reminded them about, but now the strategy is gone..."
 

 
The screenwriter shrugged and put on an innocent expression.
 

 
Clearly, it’s not his fault!
 

 
It’s all Xuzhu’s "true self" being too selfish!
 

 
His CP was reversed and the plot was altered, which was already quite tragic!
 

 
The director pulled up Tong Zhao’s personal data, and her temperature had risen to 65%, showing signs of fever: “Besides the fever, what else is there?”
 

 
“Well, if you want to talk about this, there’s plenty more,” the screenwriter listed off: “Though she feels hot to the touch, the infected person will experience cold hands and feet, a sense of mental confusion, occasional random body pains, and an increasingly strong desire to suck blood… If Anna were still alive, or if they had cooperated every time they faced difficulties, the average value should have been around 60% by the time they reached the final level, with these symptoms being quite mild.”
 

 
But now?
 

 
The assistant director pulled up the personal data of the other two actors. Song Kaiyu was at 50%, while Feng Sisi’s was shockingly low at only 43%. This proved that playing dead and doing nothing was indeed very effective. Considering her performance every time they encountered a challenge, even knowing it was just a movie, people couldn’t help but question Xuzhu’s character.
 

 
How can we pass the final level with a patient, a bystander, and a selfish person?
 

 
Everyone's expressions changed.
 

 
Only the supervisor showed interest: “This background setting can be shown to the audience. Also, make sure to synchronize and publicly release the personal data.”
 

 
“This…”
 

 
“What’s the matter? Isn’t it what everyone loves to watch in live movies?”
 

 
The supervisor was very amiable, lacking the domineering CEO vibe, and his fox-like eyes were smiling.
 

 
But once he spoke, no one dared to contradict him. The director immediately had people act according to his instructions.
 

 
The supervisor found this little actor interesting and wanted to give her a helping hand, a favor in passing. The stubborn “true self” would suffer in silence when unnoticed, but if handled correctly, it could quickly attract fans. After all, the most loyal fans are those who have been through hardship.
 

 
Sure enough, once this newly introduced data-checking feature became familiar to the audience, the discussion heat skyrocketed exponentially.
 

 
The official sources didn’t directly indicate the relationship between infection levels and fever, but based on previous clues from the official blog about the story’s background, it was easy to deduce. Observant viewers made inferences, while those less inclined to think later received educational content, leading to the understanding of one fact—
 

 
Tong Zhao is the one who put in the most effort, so she’s the most severely infected.
 

 
Then there’s the guy who’s useless at everything, but still alive with a 43% infection rate.
 

 
[Can I say I envy Feng Sisi a lot? If I had an older sister like that, I could win just by lying down.]
 

 
[Seeing her dragging behind is so annoying.]
 

 
[My heart aches for the sister…]
 

 
In instinctive movies, the suffering of actors is the most real, leading to the emergence of a specific audience group.
 

 
They were originally reality show viewers, interested in seeing how far others could push their limits, dissatisfied with traditional movies for lacking authenticity and failing to engage the audience’s emotions. Instinctive movies perfectly cater to this hidden preference.
 

 
When this audience learned about the shooting mishaps in "Countdown 72 Hours," they flocked to watch the live stream.
 

 
Especially the video of Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove bullet fragments from her flesh.
 

 
So exciting!
 

 
Even if paying to enter now means only experiencing one-third of the content, it’s still worth it.
 

 
In instinctive movies, viruses are not just about adding a poisoning debuff.
 

 
Humans enter the holographic system with their consciousness, and the virus is another string of code. The effects of different codes vary. Because it involves human nerves, the difficulty of creating these codes is quite high. The production team usually prefers to purchase existing virus code rights because it is much cheaper and safer than creating a new virus code.
 

 
The virus code used in "Countdown 72 Hours" is codenamed [Desire].
 

 
It’s quite well-known.
 

 
Because it’s cost-effective and fits the general public's imagination of zombie viruses, it’s popular.
 

 
At a 65% infection rate, movement difficulties begin to appear.
 

 
Every virus has a ranking chart showing how long actors' “selves” were able to continue performing after reaching a certain infection level.
 

 
Some viruses that cause immediate breakdown are rarely purchased by production teams.
 

 
After all, the show must go on.
 

 
[Desire] is a more moderate choice. At the top of the ranking chart is Darren, a foreign actor from "Glacial Survival." In the freezing cold, with a 70% infection rate, he lasted 20 minutes until the rescue team arrived. It was said that the director was most worried he might attack the female lead, but fortunately, the couple was married in real life, and the female lead had just given birth to their baby. Their strong relationship helped Darren suppress his instincts.
 

 
Tong Zhao is currently at 65%.
 

 
But her challenge is not just to endure the desire to attack the living.
 

 
It’s about moving, using both mind and body to find the antidote.
 

 
[Feels like this movie might end badly, the female lead has already come a long way.]
 

 
[Not easy, and if she doesn’t find the antidote, don’t mock her.]
 

 
[Admiring how the female lead has persisted until now with a sidekick who only tags along and drags on her progress.]
 

 
[Female lead’s Weibo handle @Tongzhao, come join us in supporting the fierce and cool Empress!]
 

 
"Cough, cough..."
 

 
The Empress was awakened by the coughing.
 

 
Just after a few coughs, Song Kaiyu next to her quickly covered her mouth.
 

 
It wasn't fully dawn yet, so they couldn't cough too loudly and attract the zombies' attention.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him gratefully.
 

 
"You're running a fever...?" Song Kaiyu asked in a very low voice, leaning close to her ear.
 

 
"A little," Tong Zhao said as she touched her forehead, hesitating, "It feels different from the usual cold and fever, maybe it's a change due to the virus. Do you feel uncomfortable?"
 

 
"My throat seems a bit inflamed.”
 

 
The two of them conversed softly.
 

 
With an infection level of 50%, Song Kaiyu began to feel slight discomfort. He sympathetically held Tong Zhao's hand and said, "Even though my stamina isn't great, you can rely on me. Whatever you think I can handle, just let me do it."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded.
 

 
"Get some more sleep; it's not dawn yet."
 

 
Song Kaiyu shifted slightly, allowing Tong Zhao to lean against him.
 

 
The director captured this moment between the two with a separate shot, excluding Feng Sisi from the frame.
 

 
So what if the female is strong and the male is weak?
 

 
It can still be heartwarming and sweet.
 

 
At this moment, most of the audience sensed the chemistry between the two and began to cheer for them in the comments, hoping they could overcome the challenges together.
 

 
※
 

 
When Tong Zhao woke up, she looked much better.
 

 
Song Kaiyu was quite pleased. "Rest is indeed very important."
 

 
However, the audience with the god's-eye view knew that Tong Zhao hadn’t improved at all. Even though she was just sitting and resting, her infection level had risen by another percentage point—she looked better only because she was well-rested and had the energy to suppress her physical discomfort.
 

 
The image of a beautiful, strong, and tragic character was fully on display.
 

 
By the time Song Kaiyu drove the car to the front of the research institute, Tong Zhao’s infection level had reached 68%.
 

 
The research institute was a building about twenty stories high.
 

 
From the outside, it looked like any other office building in the city, but according to Anna, it was equipped with many security measures unfriendly to intruders. The primary challenge was how to enter the building without Anna’s fingerprint.
 

 
The building's doors were completely shut.
 

 
It wasn’t just an ordinary glass door but also a solidly closed metal door.
 

 
Neither manpower nor firearms could break it; blasting methods would be needed.
 

 
[Where’s the demolition team?]
 

 
[There’s no blasting team. It would have been great if the female lead had awakened some special power from her fever last night.]
 

 
[I’m too lazy to comment. This isn’t a supernatural theme… but I really want to see Tong Zhao in an action-packed supernatural movie. She’d be amazing! What was she doing before entering the entertainment industry? She looks like a top soldier!]
 

 
[There were rumors she was a high-end escort during the filming of "The Ming Emperor's Legend." No need to guess anymore; this woman is hard to figure out.]
 

 
Facing the challenge, Feng Sisi looked towards Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was a very familiar action.
 

 
Many large trucks were parked near the research institute.
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly turned her gaze to the vehicles parked nearby, focusing on one particularly long truck with an open cargo door containing steel bars.
 

 
"I have an idea."
 

 
?
 

 
What have you thought of now?
 

 
Amidst a flurry of question marks in the comments, Tong Zhao smashed all the glass windows of the truck with a wrench. She then reached inside to open the truck door, violently broke open the control panel, and, after studying the wiring for a while, called over Song Kaiyu to help bind several steel bars to the front of the driver’s seat and the passenger seat.
 

 
What was originally an unremarkable truck now had steel bars protruding from its front.
 

 
Tong Zhao then drove the off-road vehicle and forcefully maneuvered the truck, which was originally angled away from the research institute’s main gate, to face directly toward the gate.
 

 
[Hey, I have a bold idea…]
 

 
[Don’t even think about it. No one here has the guts of Zhao Ge.]
 

 
"Step back a bit. The scene might get a bit explosive soon," Tong Zhao instructed.
 

 
Due to the virus affecting her vocal cords, her once melodious voice had become faintly hoarse.
 

 
The two complied obediently and drove the off-road vehicle to the end of the street.
 

 
Next, Tong Zhao crouched down, and found the ignition wire among a tangle of wires, and after several attempts by short-circuiting the positive terminal, she finally heard the engine start! This was a vulnerability of older cars, and since the steering wheel couldn’t be unlocked, Tong Zhao had to adjust the direction in advance…
 

 
With the throttle set to maximum, the truck barreled towards the research institute’s main gate at an unstoppable, suicidal speed.
 

 
At the critical moment, Tong Zhao leaped out of the moving truck through the open door!
 

 
The steel bars acted like an ancient battering ram, smashing through the research institute’s first line of defense. The explosion door and its frame were shattered into pieces. The loud noise stirred the zombies in the city, causing a faint disturbance.
 

 
She rolled on the road and finally came to a stop, with blood slowly seeping through the bandages on her thigh.
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s infection level: 70%]
 

 
She only slightly furrowed her brows.
# Chapter21
“Yan Qi!”
 

 
Seeing Tong Zhao being thrown out of the truck, both the audience and Song Kaiyu felt their hearts tighten.
 

 
Song Kaiyu rushed over and helped her up.
 

 
The fall was severe, and Tong Zhao, feeling dizzy and disoriented, allowed him to hold her for a moment. The close-up that the audience saw showed her gazing at the male lead’s neck with a look of hunger as they embraced.
 

 
Was she going to bite him?
 

 
Before the tension could fully build, Tong Zhao pushed away from Song Kaiyu's embrace: “I can stand on my own.”
 

 
Tong Zhao stood still, her slender frame upright like a sword with its edge bared—something that could only be observed from a distance and not touched. Just a touch would cut, and a sword didn’t need to be embraced by anyone.
 

 
The three of them climbed through the open cargo container into the driver’s seat and then entered the research institute’s lobby through the window that had been smashed open.
 

 
Like many office buildings, the first floor had a reception desk and elevators.
 

 
The interior decoration was in disarray due to the crash. Since there might be zombies inside, Tong Zhao turned to the group and signaled for silence, and the two immediately shut up, swallowing all their questions.
 

 
The office building was too tall for Tong Zhao to search alone; she might end up poisoned or worse before finding anything. The intelligent AI, detecting the importance of the scene to the plot, broadcasted Tong Zhao's inner monologue at this moment:
 

 
[My physical condition is getting worse. It’s definitely more than just a fever or a cold; the virus must be starting to take effect... Ha, it seems like we don’t have much time left. Or maybe I inadvertently did something that accelerated the virus activation? Forget it, I’ll put that aside for now.]
 

 
The protagonist is truly intelligent!
 

 
Watching a resourceful and capable hero navigate challenges is quite enjoyable.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the injured beauty face these trials makes the audience feel closer to her, evoking a sense of sympathy and hope that fate will be kinder to her.
 

 
With the guide, Anna, having fallen earlier, the director added a schematic map code at the research institute’s reception, essentially providing a map. Tong Zhao looked up at the plastic board nailed to the wall.
 

 
The doctor’s laboratory was on the top floor, the 23rd.
 

 
The elevator was still operational, sparing the three from the grueling climb up the stairs and accelerating their infection.
 

 
In the original script, they were supposed to climb, but the props team estimated that Tong Zhao might become so aggressive during the climb that she could potentially kill the other two. Therefore, the script was changed to allow the use of the elevator.
 

 
However, the elevator only went up to the 20th floor, so they would have to walk the remaining three floors.
 

 
The 21st and 22nd floors were designated as staff dormitories and patient wards respectively. After the virus outbreak, those who hadn’t escaped would likely have become hungry zombies, and they would need to pass through these two floors to reach the 23rd.
 

 
Tong Zhao informed the others of her conclusions.
 

 
“After reaching the 20th floor, we’ll definitely have to fight zombies,”
 

 
Her light-colored eyes were filled with coldness, and her grip on the gun was tight. Only the audience with the God’s-eye view knew that she was barely holding back the murderous urges caused by the virus and had no time to act kindly: “If you’re scared or want to stay back and wait for me to protect you, you can stay here and wait for me to bring back the antidote.”
 

 
“I’ll stay here, so I won’t be a burden to my sister.”
 

 
Feng Sisi quickly made her choice.
 

 
Song Kaiyu pressed his lips together, showing the resolute demeanor expected of a man: “There’s no way I’m letting you go alone. I’ll follow you. Even if it’s just firing at zombies, having an extra person means more firepower. I won’t back down in the face of danger.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him, slightly moved.
 

 
“No!”
 

 
Feng Sisi tugged at her sister’s sleeve with a pleading expression: “Don’t leave me alone again. It might not be safe here; there could be zombies sneaking in... What if you don’t get the antidote? Am I just supposed to wait here to die?”
 

 
She was genuinely anxious.
 

 
[……]
 

 
[Help, Feng Sisi is so selfish! Even the screenwriter couldn’t come up with this level of selfishness. Is she only thinking about herself?]
 

 
[How many good deeds did she do in her past life to be reborn as the female lead’s sister?]
 

 
[I accept that her values are skewed, but I really want to see Tong Zhao give her a couple of shots! Autumn pear syrup!]
 

 
Tong Zhao looked down at her, her expressive almond-shaped eyes showing no emotion.
 

 
“Yeah, wait here to die, what else?”
 

 
She spoke with a hint of curiosity, her voice even more hoarse: “Do you think I’m guaranteed to find the antidote? That I’m certain to survive? Stop dreaming. We should have died a long time ago. Right now, we’re just fighting for a sliver of hope in the hands of death. Don’t expect me to rely on you. Just stay put and wait.”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice was no longer pleasant to hear.
 

 
It was used for mockery, giving it a different flavor.
 

 
“I don’t mind if you’re useless or foolish, but you’d better obey.”
 

 
She suddenly frowned, biting her lower lip until it cracked and bled.
 

 
“I, I…”
 

 
Feng Sisi was left speechless, her face pale and filled with grievance as she looked at her, silently accusing her of cruelty. Tong Zhao, however, had no interest in watching her performance and asked, “Last chance—will you come with me or stay here?”
 

 
Feng Sisi opened her mouth and then shut it again, finally whispering with tears in her eyes, “I’m too scared to go up…”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t waste any more words with her. She grabbed her by the hair and dragged her onto the truck, then hoisted her up and shoved her head-first into the cargo area. “Stay here. If you don’t want to die, don’t make any noise.”
 

 
This kind of rough, trash-like behavior was unanimously approved by the audience.
 

 
Feng Sisi’s character had gone from being the group’s favorite to a much-despised “green tea sister.” If Tong Zhao were too kind to her, she’d be criticized as a saint.
 

 
Besides, Tong Zhao was right.
 

 
In a life-or-death escape, who has time for such pretentiousness?
 

 
Also, it was the older sister’s protection that had shielded her from hardship, but live-action films have no time for gradual character development. The stronger get stronger, and the foolish remain foolish—an unchanging rule.
 

 
The sun blazed, and everything was laid bare.
 

 
The two of them entered the elevator.
 

 
“Yan Qi, your voice is really hoarse,” Song Kaiyu noticed something.
 

 
“The virus is starting to take effect,” Tong Zhao smiled, recognizing that his voice hadn’t changed yet. “I’m experiencing it worse than you. If I completely lose control and attack you, just…”
 

 
“Then let’s die together.”
 

 
Song Kaiyu interrupted her.
 

 
Tong Zhao raised her eyebrows.
 

 
“I have to admit I’m a rather weak man. I don’t have the resolve to shoot my girlfriend. If one of us is going to survive, it should definitely be you.”
 

 
The elevator was rising quickly, so quickly that she was starting to get a bit of ear pressure.
 

 
Their situations were the same, and Song Kaiyu reached out to touch her ear. “If eating me when the virus takes over makes you feel a bit better, then I’m happy to finally be of some use in this escape journey.”
 

 
With this joking remark, the elevator arrived at the 20th floor.
 

 
The elevator doors slowly opened.
 

 
They had already heard many heavy, dense footsteps, but none of the steps were hesitant.
 

 
[I think, Feng Sisi will never know what she missed.]
 

 
[Can the romance of a strong woman and a weak man be this touching? I’m teary-eyed.]
 

 
[The writer is amazing!!]
 

 
The writer, feeling a mix of emotions and not daring to claim credit, posted a tweet:
 

 
@DailyScriptwriterQiao:
 

 
“The current plot of ‘Countdown 72 Hours’ compared to my script…
 

 
I can’t say it’s identical, but I can say it’s entirely unrelated.”
 

 
*
 

 
As Tong Zhao had expected, the 21st and 22nd floors were like scenes from hell.
 

 
Fortunately, the two were well-prepared with ample firepower, unloading magazine after magazine. As Song Kaiyu’s hands began to tremble from firing so much, Tong Zhao's infection level visibly soared, peaking from 70% to 80%. In the grand scene, every close-up shot was given to Tong Zhao, while the male lead didn’t get any close-ups.
 

 
Because she was in immense pain.
 

 
Her lower lip was bitten raw, and her beautiful eyes were half-stained gray.
 

 
The zombie horde wouldn’t give them a chance for close combat. The small knife Tong Zhao had prepared was used to cut herself, on her arms, thighs, and shoulders, inflicting pain where it was needed to maintain a minimal level of awareness. By the time they reached the stairway from the 22nd to the 23rd floor, Tong Zhao could no longer move and had to collapse in the stairwell, signaling Song Kaiyu to go up to the 23rd floor to find the antidote.
 

 
Since Song Kaiyu had been relatively unaffected, his lower infection level allowed him to search through all the bottles and jars on the top floor and find the antidote for 【Desire】. This was the margin Tong Zhao had fought to secure for him, and he seized it, grasping the faint glimmer of hope offered by death. Returning to the unconscious Tong Zhao, he personally administered the antidote to her...
 

 
As if fate had already made its arrangements.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, who had been a background character throughout the entire film, ended up having his moment of glory in the end.
 

 
Yet, not a single Tong Zhao fan felt this was undeserved.
 

 
In fact, many thought this scene was even more touching than the previous solo performances of Tong Zhao and were glad that Tong Zhao's trust in him had not been misplaced.
 

 
The two of them relied on each other and fell into an exhausted sleep, waiting for the antidote to take effect.
 

 
There was no strength left to return to the first floor to deliver the antidote to Feng Sisi, who had hoped to lay low until the end.
 

 
And she never mustered the courage to come up and find them before the end of the show.
 

 
[It’s a relief!]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, can I say I cried watching this? It’s over. I’m a fan of Jie Zai’s girlfriend, but I support this marriage now. It’s so sweet. I also want to be the female warrior protecting Jie Zai!]
 

 
[Tong Zhao, forever a god!]
 

 
At the end of the show, the actors opened their eyes simultaneously.
 

 
It felt like waking up from a long dream, still disoriented.
 

 
When Tong Zhao opened her eyes, Duan Ge was still in control of her primary persona. However, the memories of everyone in the drama had not yet returned, so no one knew how they performed or what had happened in the drama. As soon as Tong Zhao stepped out of the cabin, a blonde-haired, round-faced figure and Tang Jingjie rushed over, hugging her from both sides.
 

 
?
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Duan Ge was a bit confused and habitually patted their heads, one hand on each: “Be good, be good.”
 

 
“Wuwuwu, I don’t even know why, I just really want to hug you…” Tang Jingjie, being a soft-hearted boy, couldn’t help but blurt out: “I’m doomed, my manager is definitely going to kill me. We won’t be rumored, right? Oh my God, what happened in the drama, I don’t want to let you go…”
 

 
“It’s normal to not want to let go, you should hold on!”
 

 
Anna, who had watched the second half of the drama due to leaving early, was also crying.
 

 
Everyone was quite moved, but Xu Zhu, who had been left aside, awkwardly looked towards the director's team. She guessed that Tong Zhao must have had a particularly tragic end because they were all so upset, and she gave Tong Zhao some comforting words:
 

 
“It’s normal for a post-apocalyptic survival film to be very challenging. It’s okay if you didn’t perform perfectly. Tong Zhao, don’t be too hard on yourself.”
# Chapter22
As soon as she finished speaking, Xu Zhu felt countless gazes turning toward her.
 

 
It was as if she had said something hilariously foolish.
 

 
She wasn’t unfamiliar with this kind of attention.
 

 
Before entering the holographic filming chamber, she had always been the focus of such looks, usually directed at her stepsister.
 

 
Was there a problem with the filming?
 

 
Xu Zhu grew anxious and quickly tried to make amends: “My memory hasn’t fully returned yet. If I said something wrong, I’m sorry. I still hope the filming went well!” She then flashed a compliant smile to everyone.
 

 
She was a bit smarter than her character Feng Sisi, knowing how to shift the narrative.
 

 
After all, they had returned to a peaceful world. Unless faced with life-or-death situations, people’s darker sides are hidden beneath their polished exteriors, and once the lights are on, everyone appears dignified.
 

 
“The filming was very successful. I believe the box office will reach an ideal number!” The director stepped in to smooth things over.
 

 
With the director’s words, the other staff members also gracefully shifted the topic.
 

 
Xu Zhu's intentions for bringing Tong Zhao into the group were not entirely pure, but that was only known to her.
 

 
In the eyes of the director and some core members, Xu Zhu was seen as the final piece of the puzzle for "Countdown 72 Hours," a key contributor to the funding and promotion!
 

 
If she spoke negatively about Tong Zhao here, what would that imply?
 

 
It would imply that she was being modest!
 

 
Before filming, she praised Tong Zhao excessively, boosting their confidence, and after filming, she did not seek credit for herself, truly a generous person.
 

 
Xu Zhu, feeling uneasy, joined the conversation. Due to her blank memory and uncertainty about the developments, she could only engage in conversation with Anna, the third female lead whom she had chatted with pleasantly before filming. However, Anna politely avoided her.
 

 
Since Anna's role was brief and she died early in the story, her in-film memory had already recovered.
 

 
How should one put it?
 

 
Although she knew it was all acting, being used as a scapegoat still wasn’t pleasant.
 

 
Hatred is too strong a word; being close friends is unnecessary.
 

 
If she had this time, why not get to know Miss Tong better?
 

 
Anna, in high spirits, went off to find her Eastern beauty.
 

 
Only the screenwriter walked over, patted Xu Zhu's shoulder, and gave a wry smile: “Xu Zhu, you really caused me a big trouble!”
 

 
His private messages and comments on Weibo had exploded.
 

 
The movie was good, but the key was that it had nothing to do with him; he was just a gatekeeper, with the highlights all coming from the actors themselves. The downside of instinctive films is that they test the editor's ability to create new worlds, and often, the outstanding performance is credited to the actors.
 

 
Especially actors like Tong Zhao, who have a very strong personal presence.
 

 
Oh well!
 

 
He could only think about the bonuses and fame that would come if the movie became a hit.
 

 
The screenwriter’s worried frown was partly genuine, while Xu Zhu, with a pleased expression, apologized to him on behalf of Tong Zhao.
 

 
The two of them comforted each other across channels; although they weren't talking about the same thing, they both had a mutual understanding and unspoken sentiments of regret and happiness.
 

 
After adding a long list of new contacts on WeChat, Tong Zhao was allowed to rest before attending the celebration banquet the next day. According to the stage crew, the unedited and raw footage had already been sent to their personal email, while the polished movie would be available for viewing rights online a week later.
 

 
She took a shower and was about to go to bed when the door was knocked.
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit surprised, and even more so when she saw a golden head through the peephole.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Xiao Ge, are you awake?]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I’m here.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Anna came; she’s probably here to find you.]
 

 
Duan Ge responded, and Tong Zhao then handed over the position of the main personality to her.
 

 
At their core, they were the same person and had never competed for the main role.
 

 
Staying in the memory palace to sleep was quite comfortable; as long as "she" was doing well, that was enough.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door to find Anna standing outside with a snow-white pillow, looking quite embarrassed.
 

 
"Is there something you need?" she asked gently.
 

 
"The feeling from the scene hasn’t faded. I keep feeling like zombies might break into my room at any moment. I'm scared alone and can’t sleep by myself..." Anna continued, "Could I sleep with you tonight? I can just sleep on the sofa."
 

 
The actors’ rooms on set were spacious, with a long sofa available for resting.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, "Come in. You can sleep with me."
 

 
Anna tiptoed inside and stole a glance at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Unlike her stylish short hair in the film, Tong Zhao outside of the scene had long, jet-black hair that looked like seaweed. She probably had just showered, as her hair was still damp. Her almond-shaped eyes, black and white under the light, had a poetic and picturesque quality unique to Eastern beauties. Anna stared, fascinated, and asked, "Can I help you dry your hair?"
 

 
Tong Zhao turned her gaze slightly, surprised.
 

 
Anna quickly added, "Consider it as a thank you for letting me stay."
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded with no objection.
 

 
After receiving permission, Anna happily went to get the hair dryer.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat down, and Anna placed her damp hair on her hands. As she dried it, she said enviously, “Your hair quality is really amazing. Do you have any special maintenance tips? I’ve heard that many Chinese actresses drink traditional Chinese medicine to stay looking so young.”
 

 
Tong Zhao pondered for a moment and replied, “Go to bed early, get up early, and exercise more to boost your metabolism.”
 

 
“That’s it?”
 

 
“That’s all.”
 

 
Anna marveled once again at Tong Zhao’s beauty, which seemed to have been kissed by the gods.
 

 
If the so-called "system" claiming to be the main deity can be considered a god, then this statement does hold some truth.
 

 
Once the hair was half-dried, Tong Zhao held Anna’s hand and said, “I plan to watch some of the rough cuts before bed. I’m going to start now; would you like to join me? If not, I’ll just use headphones and watch alone.”
 

 
Anna agreed happily, so the two young women sat side by side on the sofa, turned off the lights, and watched the rough cuts of their own performance.
 

 
In the neighboring room, separated by just a wall, Xu Zhu was doing the same thing.
 

 
The movie started, but Tong Zhao didn’t immediately switch to double speed. Instead, she stayed with Anna, watching the scene where she was dragged off as a substitute. Anna was still deeply affected by this scene, angrily hitting the pillow: “She’s so annoying, just a bitch. I really… I can’t face this face anymore! She only needed to avoid it! I didn’t do anything wrong, and I’m so useful!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Continue.”
 

 
Anna, with a confused look on her freckled face: “Huh?”
 

 
“If you can talk, say more.”
 

 
As soon as she finished speaking, the scene switched to where Tong Zhao was pressing Xu Zhu’s head down onto a public restroom floor, making her bow.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t recall this memory at the moment, so she had to replay it repeatedly to savor it.
 

 
Anna, witnessing this personal grudge: “…”
 

 
After that scene passed, Tong Zhao switched to double speed to save time.
 

 
Anna was shocked and asked, “Do you hate her that much?”
 

 
“Not really. Don’t you think this part is quite satisfying?”
 

 
“You switched to double speed right after making her bow…”
 

 
Tong Zhao curved her lips slightly, the blue light from the TV screen casting a cold outline around her: “Don’t you have scenes coming up? Since you want to watch, I won’t fast-forward.”
 

 
With that, she became fully engrossed in the plot.
 

 
Anna, however, couldn’t focus on the screen anymore. Her heart was pounding as she watched Tong Zhao intently. Taking advantage of Tong Zhao’s concentration, she quietly moved closer and snuggled up to her. Tong Zhao didn’t mind at all. Noticing the added weight on her shoulder, she glanced at Anna, assuming the air conditioning was too low and that Anna was cold. She grabbed a thin blanket from beside her and draped it over Anna’s shoulders, pulling it closer around herself as well: “Still cold?”
 

 
……
 

 
The intimidating Eastern beauty knows how to flirt too well!
 

 
Apart from the part where she taught Xu Zhu a lesson, Tong Zhao mainly reviewed the crisis management aspects of the film, identifying many areas for improvement. In case of another apocalypse, she……
 

 
After finishing the sample footage, Duan Ge returned control of the body to Tong Zhao and also triggered two system notifications.
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s passive skill “Best in Show”: Physical fitness greatly enhanced, allowing the host to enjoy the physical strength developed by Duan Ge during the apocalyptic scenarios without any pain.]
 

 
[Congratulations, host, for activating Duan Ge’s active skill “Ultimate Moment”: The host can exceed human limits for ten minutes each day, performing theoretically impossible actions.]
 

 
Notably, the system also provided conditions for upgrading the skill.
 

 
For the Empress Shen-related skills, receiving a confession from an S-rank man grants one upgrade opportunity, while confessions from ranks below S (ABC) increase experience points accordingly. What surprised Tong Zhao was that a confession from an E-rank man actually decreases experience points.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Experience points can be deducted?]
 

 
Empress Shen: [It's reasonable. If a low-quality man has the courage to confess to me, it’s a disgrace. You must not have appeared noble or aloof enough; it’s time for reflection.]
 

 
Fair enough.
 

 
A woman favored by the emperor indeed has the right to be so demanding.
 

 
In comparison, the conditions for upgrading Duan Ge’s skills are more reasonable and positive.
 

 
Saving a man grants half an upgrade opportunity.
 

 
For women, it grants a full upgrade.
 

 
Female Reporter: [Duan Ge’s true nature confirmed.]
 

 
[It’s not me, I didn’t do it,] Duan Ge denied, scratching her face. [I just care more for women. If women don’t pity women, should we wait for men to save us?]
 

 
Lu Xianchang silently gave a thumbs up.
 

 
Given this trend, Tong Zhao really feared that one day after acting in a fantasy drama, Lu Xianchang’s skill upgrade condition might be to personally eliminate scumbag men—killing one would grant a level-up. But that’s a long way off, so she tried not to think too much about it.
 

 
After the movie ended, Anna was once again moved to tears by the ending.
 

 
Tong Zhao handed her a tissue and acted as a comforting, secure pillow all night until the golden-haired round-face fell asleep in her arms.
 

 
They slept soundly, but someone in the neighboring room couldn’t sleep.
 

 
After watching the sample, Xu Zhu finally understood why the other staff members looked at her oddly.
 

 
It turned out, it wasn’t because Tong Zhao had ruined the performance…
 

 
On the contrary, she had performed exceptionally well.
 

 
It was Xu Zhu who had messed up!
 

 
Xu Zhu twisted her fingers until they were white, too afraid to check Weibo on her phone.
 

 
Her mind was filled with images of Feng Sisi from the movie—
 

 
How could she be like this?
 

 
Recognizing oneself is an eternal challenge in life. Those often called brave might flee when faced with true danger, while the most ordinary and unremarkable individuals might sacrifice themselves to save others during an earthquake... Xu Zhu knew she wasn't particularly kind, but she never imagined she could be so outrageous.
 

 
What puzzled Xu Zhu even more was how she might have messed up, but how could Tong Zhao perform so well?
 

 
Wasn’t she just someone who flattered men?
 

 
It was all Tong Zhao’s fault. If Tong Zhao hadn’t performed so well, Xu Zhu wouldn’t have looked so selfish and conspicuous.
 

 
While Xu Zhu was anxious and confused, a message from a special contact on WeChat arrived:
 

 
Dad: [How was your performance in the first film?]
 

 
Dad: [I have high hopes for you. In my heart, you're actually better than Tong Zhao. Don’t let me down.]
 

 
She had longed for such words for many years.
 

 
At that moment, her heart rate suddenly quickened, and she felt her hands and feet turn cold with panic.
# Chapter23
The bright phone screen hurt Xu Zhu's eyes.
 

 
But she couldn't ignore her father's message, so she hesitantly replied: [It was okay.]
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhenming replied with a voice message.
 

 
“What do you mean by ‘okay’? You are now the rightful young lady of the Tong family, my daughter, and you need to be confident. I don't like the way you speak; you need to change that. Don’t embarrass me and make me regret choosing you.”
 

 
Judging by the slightly tipsy tone, it seemed he had remembered to ask after leaving a drinking session.
 

 
In the dimly lit room, Xu Zhu clutched her phone tightly, her face showing a look of defeat.
 

 
She wanted her father to comfort her…
 

 
Clearly, she had hinted at her unhappiness and was nearly choking up, but what her father cared about was something else—
 

 
He didn’t like her tone and was concerned about her causing him embarrassment.
 

 
If we’re talking about confidence, Tong Zhao certainly had plenty of it.
 

 
Whether at school or at home, even if her father abandoned her, Tong Zhao always appeared as if she were the chosen one, calm and graceful, exuding an air of elegance.
 

 
Xu Zhu, infuriated, threw her phone onto the bed and took out a Polaroid photo from her wallet.
 

 
It was a photo of her and Tong Zhao together.
 

 
Xu Zhu traced over Tong Zhao's face with her glittering nails in the photo, leaving scratches on that impeccably beautiful face. This action somewhat cooled her anger—envy is truly the most burning emotion, and she resented Tong Zhao so much. Tong Zhenming was also a despicable man—didn't she want to have that kind of long-term, ingrained confidence? Why didn’t she? Just because she grew up alongside the Tong family's daughter!?
 

 
If only Tong Zhenming had married her mother back then.
 

 
Why didn’t her mother act sooner?
 

 
Xu Zhu clenched and flattened the photo, feeling heartbroken and on the verge of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao was her obsession.
 

 
Only by defeating her and proving she was better could Xu Zhu hope to resolve this knot.
 

 
---
 

 
After filming *Countdown 72 Hours*, Xu Zhu had to return to shoot the second half of *Star Selection Girls*.
 

 
The girls in the group all knew that Xu Zhu had connections. Except for a few contestants with backgrounds who had some conflicts with her, the other contestants were all polite. The director even arranged a short-haired roommate for Xu Zhu, who was kind and willing to play a supporting role.
 

 
Before Xu Zhu left, she was full of confidence.
 

 
Everyone knew she had film resources even before officially debuting.
 

 
However, upon returning, Xu Zhu was very low-key. Only when her roommate came back from dance practice and found an extra person in the room did she excitedly ask, "Xu Zhu, you finished filming the movie? When can we see it? I will definitely buy a ticket to support you."
 

 
"Yes, it's done," Xu Zhu replied.
 

 
Mentioning the movie made Xu Zhu's eyes redden a bit. "Don't watch it. It feels strange for people I know to see me in a movie."
 

 
She really wished the film would never be released.
 

 
It would be best if it failed to pass review and stayed forever in the vault.
 

 
The short-haired roommate thought Xu Zhu was just being shy and laughed, "I'll buy twenty tickets and invite the whole group to watch. By the way, the team-building event hasn't been decided yet. How about we go to watch your movie together? It sounds like a great idea and would show our team spirit."
 

 
Xu Zhu: "…”
 

 
She knew her roommate was just flattering her.
 

 
After all, this roommate didn’t have any connections, had average popularity, and her only persona was "Xu Zhu's little princess's maid and close friend." She had attracted some fans who liked Yuri through the cute "sisterly" angle, barely surviving each voting period, and was definitely trying to curry favor with Xu Zhu.
 

 
It was awful.
 

 
Xu Zhu couldn’t imagine how the top contestants, who usually didn’t get along with her, would react when they discovered she had messed up the movie. They would likely make a big deal out of it and criticize her.
 

 
According to Murphy’s Law, "the more you fear something, the more likely it is to happen," as soon as Xu Zhu dropped her luggage in the dorm, Gu Yanzhi, who had been in second place in the last voting, pushed open their slightly ajar door. Even before showing her face, her voice was already heard, "Xu Zhu, your sacrifice for this movie is too great!"
 

 
"What sacrifice?"
 

 
Her roommate looked confused.
 

 
Gu Yanzhi grinned and waved her phone, which was playing a scene of Xu Zhu bowing repeatedly, her forehead reddened and eyes full of tears.
 

 
【"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."】
 

 
This short video even had sound, and Gu Yanzhi was laughing so hard she almost cracked.
 

 
It was so satisfying, a really good movie, even better than some indie films.
 

 
Xu Zhu, relying on her wealthy father and connections with the production team, had been flaunting her little princess act. Gu Yanzhi had long been annoyed by her. With both having similar backgrounds and fan popularity, when it was revealed that Xu Zhu landed this movie opportunity, everyone thought Xu Zhu would definitely overshadow her upon returning.
 

 
Who would have thought?
 

 
The little princess was now bowing down.
 

 
Xu Zhu glared at the phone Gu Yanzhi was waving, her face dark with anger, almost wanting to leap forward and tear her face apart.
 

 
But realizing that a physical altercation would not benefit anyone, Xu Zhu chose to hold back, ending this small dispute with her suppressed anger.
 

 
In the instinctive movie, she would explode and turn things around.
 

 
In reality, after weighing the pros and cons, she decided to remember this incident and settle scores with Gu Yanzhi and Tong Zhao later.
 

 
Because of this, Xu Zhu’s performance in the filming of the program significantly declined.
 

 
She couldn’t focus at all.
 

 
Moreover, *Countdown 72 Hours* was broadcast live. Although most viewers chose to wait for reviews and the final cut before watching, evaluations of the film had already leaked, along with some edited short videos:
 

 
The top three most popular clips were:
 

 
1. Feng Sisi drags Anna in to be a scapegoat, then apologizes while being forced to bow her head.
 
2. Tong Zhao using tweezers to remove a bullet from her eyebrow.
 
3. In the final scene, Song Kaiyu, having obtained the crucial antidote, feeds it to his girlfriend and then they fall asleep shoulder to shoulder.
 

 
Except for the third clip, which was marketed by Sister and Tang Jingjie’s companies, the first two clips spread virally on their own, hitting all the high points for netizens—beautiful, powerful, and tragic. The ugly scars left by the bullets on her white thighs were visually striking. Traditionally, such "cutting the bones to remove poison" scenes were privileges reserved for male actors, showcasing their tough-guy image.
 

 
But Tong Zhao was determined to make her mark in the male-dominated field.
 

 
When *Countdown 72 Hours* aired, the character that drew the most attention was the female lead.
 

 
Tong Zhao had such a strong presence that even fans of the male lead had to bow down.
 

 
#FengSisiDoesNotDeserveIt#
 

 
#TouchingChineseSisterFengYanqi#
 

 
#BowDownToTheSister#
 

 
The male lead was originally quite unworthy.
 

 
However, in the end, overcoming his fears fighting alongside the female lead, and saying lines like, "Then let’s die together," which female viewers love, turned around the audience's favor in the final ten minutes. Fans of the mom were comforted and commented: [Jie’s grown up / heart/heart]
 

 
A passerby commented: [Why not call him Jiebao?]
 

 
And this comment received likes well into the next year.
 

 
Tong Zhao's new fans were eager for her work. Unlike the first batch of fans who got into the fandom, they could also explore *The Legend of Emperor Ming*...
 

 
However, they were stunned to see that the role of the ultra-cool "Yanqi" in the first episode of her new work was actually set in a palace intrigue theme.
 

 
How can she do palace intrigue?
 

 
A physics major excelling in palace intrigue?
 

 
It’s truly unfathomable.
 

 
But the numbers are objective. The episodes of *The Legend of Emperor Ming* featuring Tong Zhao saw a small spike in sales, and the Empress's dance received renewed attention, especially when combined with Duan Ge’s action scenes…
 

 
You don’t even need to watch the movie; just seeing those three clips and GIFs is enough to understand that the meme has truly gone viral.
 

 
Moreover, these memes have attracted a large number of people to purchase viewing rights. Zombie action movies haven’t been a popular genre in recent years, but due to the crowd mentality, many people watched *Countdown 72 Hours* to avoid missing out, to have something to discuss with friends, and to show off their knowledge on Weibo and Moments, creating a positive cycle of admiration among peers.
 

 
Since the film is available online, with strict copyright control, it effectively curtails the possibility of piracy and avoids the "screening tyranny" of cinemas, which forces viewers to watch poorly reviewed movies due to overbooked schedules. With just a helmet on or lying in a cabin, you can watch any movie you want without interference, even if the cinema's big shots come.
 

 
In this environment, the quality of the film and the effectiveness of its promotion are greatly enhanced.
 

 
Good wine isn’t afraid of deep alleys, but if the aroma is strong enough, even a film that’s just passable can make a decent profit.
 

 
*Countdown 72 Hours* has both of these qualities.
 

 
It’s genuinely exciting and visually appealing, and it has become a hit because of various interesting memes.
 

 
It emerged suddenly, and no film could compete with it.
 

 
Tong Zhao's Weibo follower count skyrocketed, and the number of invitations sent to her agent, Chu Jie, multiplied several times. If the industry had merely extended olive branches to her after she finished *The Legend of Ming Emperor*, after *72 Hours*, she would have been in high demand for variety shows, interviews, and endorsements—everyone was eager for her.
 

 
It can be said that now, as long as she agrees, there are no resources Tong Zhao can't get, except for the top-tier celebrities!
 

 
"Interviews are a given, and now you can finally choose some high-end ads. It was right to turn down that spicy noodle ad before. Now there are offers for watches and perfumes," Chu Jie said happily. "There's also a supplement cover for *YQ*. Although it’s just a supplement, it’s still *YQ*. I've marked it in your schedule; you need to keep those times open."
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Tong Zhao responded.
 

 
Chu Jie looked up at her: “Are you doing yoga?”
 

 
Tong Zhao answered seriously, “I’m doing yoga while absorbing the essence of the sun and moon.”
 

 
With her foundational training solidified, she no longer needed to sit cross-legged; she could now practice advanced poses, effectively multitasking and achieving more with less effort. However, Chu Jie clearly didn’t quite understand and looked at her with a puzzled expression before continuing, “Then there are variety shows… two guest appearances, one long-term.”
 

 
The variety show invitations were all aimed at her, with both guest appearances related to survival themes.
 

 
One is about surviving on a desert island, and the other is about farming in the countryside.
 

 
The long-term one is interesting—it’s a romance variety show.
 

 
As soon as Empress Chen saw this topic, she couldn't sit still: "Let me have a go; I want to raise fish!"
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately crossed out the farming option. She had never done farming during her quick transmigrations and saw no need to challenge herself in an area she wasn't skilled in. However, the desert island survival show was worth considering.
 

 
As for the romance variety show?
 

 
She glanced at the title: *Beware of the Sea King: Attack with Heart*.
 

 
This peculiar title sounded somewhat familiar; it seemed to have been popular in her previous life.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded, “Interesting, let’s go with that one.”
# Chapter24
“Romance variety show?”
 

 
After hearing Tong Zhao's decision, Sister Chu gave her a subtle look, one that seemed to say—
 

 
"Are you trying to pull another stunt?"
 

 
She had the same expression when Tong Zhao wanted to take on a big female lead role in a zombie action film.
 

 
At that time, she had stopped her, but considering the box office success of *Countdown 72 Hours*, her advice lingered on her lips. Instead of directly dissuading her, she said, “The show you’ve chosen is in holographic format, which is similar to shooting a reality film. It will reveal your most authentic side.”
 

 
With current technology, holographic filming can only be done this way.
 

 
Audiences seem to love it.
 

 
It makes sense; people want to see the real side of glamorous stars, and even for ordinary people with no fame, exposing their true nature can be intriguing—whether it’s a seemingly innocent student engaging in shady online activities, a well-educated white-collar worker secretly mistreating stray cats, or a wealthy young man showing his lonely and kind side…
 

 
Whether good or bad, it’s all about satisfying voyeuristic desires.
 

 
The criminal code outlines ways to make big money.
 

 
And industries that cater to human vices often make a substantial profit.
 

 
“Although traditional variety shows have fewer viewers, they are stable and can help establish your existing persona,” Sister Chu said.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook her head.
 

 
She was confident this variety show would be a hit. Since she had been invited, she didn't want to miss out.
 

 
Perhaps it was a habit from her experiences in the quick-wear world of completing tasks and missions, Tong Zhao found it hard to relax. She was always purposeful, and if she stopped for a moment, she began to feel anxious, eager to keep working. High productivity was a source of her security; not advancing meant falling behind, and she wouldn’t let an opportunity slip by.
 

 
However, she needed a good reason to reassure her manager.
 

 
“I also want to experience a sweet, innocent romance in a variety show.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said.
 

 
As she spoke, her aura seemed to radiate an otherworldly charm, as if every word she said was profound wisdom.
 

 
“Are you sure?”
 

 
Sister Chu gave her a sidelong glance and flipped over the proposal for the romance variety show to show her the content summary.
 

 
“Beware of the Heartbreaker: Conquering the Heart”
 

 
“Six single men and women will live under the same roof. They will forget their real-life identities and receive a new identity card, along with different tasks, and must find a way to earn living expenses. Each person has one opportunity to confess their feelings. Will you find true love, or will you be just another fish in someone else's pond? Be careful, as there are two heartbreakers among the six, with impure motives aiming to set your heart on fire.”
 

 
...
 

 
Sweet, innocent romance.
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit pained, but she was certain Empress Shen would love this concept.
 

 
Without missing a beat, she said, “I’m sure. It’s perfect for me as if it was tailor-made for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was confident. Even if she didn't draw the heartbreaker card, she had the ability to make any heartbreaker release all the fish in their pond and love only her. After all, how could a mere heartbreaker compare to an emperor with three thousand beauties? An emperor doesn’t just have a pond but the entire Pacific Ocean and he alone favors her, a beautiful mermaid.
 

 
Sister Chu studied her for a moment, then nodded without further discussion. “Alright, I’ll clear your schedule.”
 

 
She made a few notes on the calendar. “You’ll need to film a promotional video before entering the cabin, and the identity cards will be drawn before filming starts.”
 

 
That was good.
 

 
If a more suitable personality emerged, it could be swapped in advance.
 

 
“Is there a script?” Tong Zhao asked.
 

 
“Reality variety shows only have guiding plots, not the kind of script you’re imagining for traditional variety shows.”
 

 
“Oh, and at the beginning of next month, you and a few other leads from ‘72 Hours’ need to appear on a show for promotion. You’ll need to keep that day free…”
 

 
“How long will ‘Survivor Island’ take to film? If it’s less than three days, I’d like to join,” she said, recalling what Duan Ge mentioned.
 

 
“Sure.”
 

 
After some back-and-forth, Tong Zhao’s electronic calendar was filled to the brim with appointments.
 

 
*
 

 
After finishing ‘72 Hours,’ Tong Zhao enjoyed a valuable week off.
 

 
She had slept all day in the apartment, spent the entire next day dealing with personal matters at her computer, and was woken up on the third day by the doorbell.
 

 
Expecting it to be some kind of sales visit, she peered through the peephole and saw a familiar brown-dyed head—the long-lost Wei Dasha.
 

 
Tong Zhao opened the door, a bit surprised. “A rare visitor.”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t come empty-handed; he carried two large bags full of items and, without hesitation, took off his shoes and walked in. The bags were filled with daily necessities, and soon enough, he had packed her refrigerator and bathroom cabinet. Tong Zhao was even more surprised. “So, you’ve finally decided to give up on inheriting the family business to become a civil servant, and you’re practicing precise poverty alleviation at my place?”
 

 
“Poverty alleviation my foot, I’m just worried you might starve at home.”
 

 
Wei Zekai had seen her perform on stage with Xu Zhu and, concerned that she might be feeling down, found an excuse to check on her.
 

 
Seeing that she was doing well, he felt relieved and started paying attention to some trivial matters. “By the way, can you perform that thing again?”
 

 
“What thing?”
 

 
“You know,” Wei Zekai gestured on his thigh, “the one with the bullet.”
 

 
Tong Zhao forced a smile. "I could use your head to demonstrate bowing."
 

 
"Ugh."
 

 
Although he knew it was impossible, Wei Zekai still sighed deeply with regret.
 

 
Tong Zhao rummaged through the snacks he hadn’t put in the refrigerator and found three large packs of premium cigarettes, clearly expensive. She was speechless. "Why did you buy me cigarettes? When have you ever seen me smoke?"
 

 
"You smoked in the movie."
 

 
Wei Zekai gave her a sidelong glance.
 

 
The rebellious young man’s usually cool and arrogant face was now full of melancholy.
 

 
Tong Zhao, even if slow on the uptake, understood. She slammed the table. "Do you really like the character Feng Yanqi I played?"
 

 
Wei Zekai extended his face. "It’s somewhat interesting."
 

 
"So you do like it."
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, unpacked the cigarettes and lighter he gave her, and, like in the movie, flicked the lighter with a flourish before lighting the cigarette. She held it between her fingers and gave him a smile that was very much in the style of "Duan Ge," making this arrogant young master freeze in place. Before he could react, she extinguished the cigarette. "How’s that? I’ve even done a special performance just for you.”
 

 
... So cool!
 

 
Wei Zekai took a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure. "It is somewhat interesting."
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled, then remembered something important.
 

 
"Wen Kai and the others mentioned wanting to invest in the film industry before, right? It definitely has potential, but I think their vision is still a bit narrow. Relying solely on your pocket money and my current salary won’t be enough."
 

 
The film industry is an expensive endeavor, and even the Tong family might struggle with it.
 

 
The Wei family, however, could handle it.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reputation was a concern. As far as Tong Zhao knew, his most profitable investments were those where he did nothing at all. During periods when he followed motivational posts on WeChat and Zhihu about starting businesses, he ended up losing a lot of money.
 

 
This led his well-meaning friends to secretly feed him the toxic message, "Effort doesn’t guarantee success, but not trying is definitely comfortable," to prevent him from wasting more money.
 

 
The Wei family no longer dared to let him play around and planned to find someone else to manage the group in the future, turning Wei Zekai into a figurehead. They hoped he would quickly settle down, start a family, and have a grandchild with some investment sense, or even a granddaughter would do.
 

 
Although Wei Zekai had already given up on starting a business, his legendary status still persisted in the world.
 

 
A legendary status earned for nothing.
 

 
But Tong Zhao remembered that, in her previous life, Wei Zekai had initially failed many times before learning from his mistakes and improving.
 

 
But now, no one believes he can succeed.
 

 
"I'll find a way to get some money from home," Wei Zekai pondered, causing his family’s elder to have a headache. "Should I go back and tell them I'll castrate myself if they don’t give me a billion?"
 

 
"If you say anything more, I might not be able to stop myself from stepping in," Tong Zhao shot him a look. "I want to pool the money and give you some investment advice, as long as you trust my judgment."
 

 
Firstly, she has a few years' worth of advanced knowledge about which companies and stocks will rise.
 

 
Secondly, her experiences in the modern world of quick-wear have also given her some insights into investing.
 

 
What she lacks is the capital.
 

 
She also wants to create a business circle where she holds the leading position, a circle that Xu Zhu and the Tong family have no right to touch.
 

 
Not only does she want to act, but she also wants to surpass Tong Zhenming in his most proud field.
 

 
"Actually, even if you hadn’t come to me, I was planning to invite you out to discuss something serious," Tong Zhao said, walking over to the top of the cluttered cabinet with her long legs. She placed a document, which had been weighed down by a mooncake tin, in front of Wei Zekai. The faint smell of smoke still lingered in the air, adding a touch of business atmosphere to the otherwise casual setting. As Wei Zekai looked at her, he almost saw through her and glimpsed the highly confident female lead from *Countdown 72 Hours*.
 

 
“Duan Ge” is just one of Tong Zhao's personas in the world; she is still herself.
 

 
"Here are seven investment opportunities I’m very optimistic about. You can review the details. They’ll use up more than a year's worth of your pocket money, including my acting fees. You can take them back to consult a lawyer and see if there’s anyone else who wants to join us."
 

 
Tong Zhao paused and gave him a teasing smile:
 

 
"Mr. Wei, are you willing to go bankrupt with me again?"
 

 
Her young and beautiful face radiated with vibrant ambition, burning into Wei Zekai's retina.
 

 
After understanding her words, Wei Zekai's heart raced.
 

 
He was moved.
 

 
Not in a romantic sense.
 

 
Why do rich second-generation heirs repeatedly fall for investment and entrepreneurship scams? It’s clear they could easily live a comfortable life just by collecting dividends and rent. The desire to prove oneself in youth often outweighs everything else. Everyone thinks Wei Zekai lacks the ability to start a business and the vision for investment…
 

 
But Tong Zhao was telling him to try again.
 

 
"Alright, I’ll go back and take a look,”
 

 
Wei Zekai made an effort to keep his voice calm, but he was insistent: "From now on, as long as you have a film you're working on, my family will invest in it."
 

 
He was eager to support his good friend in this way.
 

 
He wanted to tie his investment directly to the films she made.
 

 
Tong Zhao nodded without hesitation and smiled at him again.
 

 
The news about Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao working together spread quickly among the second-generation circles. Those who were friendly with Wei Zekai found it amusing and interesting, so without much hesitation, they joined the investment venture, forming an investment interest group. An unnamed friend even humorously renamed the group to:
 

 
【Mr. Wei’s Charity Foundation】
 

 
No one had much faith in this venture set up by the second-generation heirs playing around.
 

 
The most skeptical was Ning Zhiyi, who had just started dealing with the business in his own company.
 

 
He thought Tong Zhao must be crazy to be interested in Wei Zekai. Others also couldn’t understand why they would get involved, so he advised the more diligent and well-behaved second-generation heirs to stay away from this group that seemed like throwing money into the sea. His advice had some effect, as many cautious second-generation heirs turned down Wei Zekai’s invitation.
# Chapter25
Ning Zhiyi didn't feel at all that he was cutting off someone's financial path.
 

 
He thought he was actually doing a good deed, accumulating merit.
 

 
And it was for Tong Zhao's benefit.
 

 
If Tong Zhao collaborated with Wei Zekai and a bunch of second-generation heirs lost money, even if they had agreed in advance that the investment could result in a loss, how could they not hold a grudge against her? He didn’t want to see her offend so many people. Not only did he advise others not to invest, but he also called Tong Zhao to persuade her to reconsider.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi cautiously asked, “Are you really going to invest with Wei Zekai?”
 

 
“Yes, is there a problem?”
 

 
Tong Zhao responded coldly.
 

 
Ning Zhiyi frowned and tried to give good advice, saying many heartfelt words. As the conversation went on, he drifted further: “You’re a girl, you shouldn’t mix with Wei Zekai and his crowd. I heard you even invested your own film earnings? They’re all only children in their families; no matter how they waste money, there’s always someone to cover it. Now that Uncle Tong is old and has a child, and you’ve fallen out with him, you need to think about your own future…”
 

 
“I’m investing for my own benefit,” Tong Zhao interrupted him. “I know you’re advising people you know not to invest.”
 

 
Caught off guard by her directness, Ning Zhiyi awkwardly fell silent for three seconds. “I’m just worried about you.”
 

 
“Worried about me? That’s a bit amusing. But I don’t mind your little maneuvers behind my back. I’m not planning to bring too many people into this. I just want to let you know that since you’ve chosen your side, there’s no need to contact me again. I’m not interested in being friends with Xu Zhu’s boyfriend.”
 

 
In a flash, Ning Zhiyi thought he had grasped the issue.
 

 
He softened his tone, “Are you jealous of Xu Zhu?”
 

 
Tong Zhao was momentarily at a loss for words.
 

 
Duan Ge was quite displeased: “I’d rather eat raw than be jealous of Xu Zhu. What a joke.”
 

 
Empress Chen: “Help, does he think Zhao Zhao likes him? I’m offended; it’s disgusting.”
 

 
She pulled at the corners of her mouth, remaining calm. She smiled and said, “Why is it that you’re so confident when you’re even less appealing than Wei Zekai? Goodbye, don’t bother me again.”
 

 
With that, Tong Zhao ended the call.
 

 
When Ning Zhiyi tried calling again, the line was already disconnected.
 

 
“What do you mean that even Wei Zekai is better?”
 

 
Wei Zekai himself felt somewhat offended.
 

 
Tong Zhao turned off the speakerphone and looked at the group of friends gathered in her apartment. Five young men and women had crowded the already small room to the point where there was barely space to move. These pampered young masters and mistresses didn’t seem to care at all. They brought their own drinks and junk food, and were huddled together munching on McDonald's.
 

 
When she turned back, she saw Wei Zekai with a whole chicken wing hanging from his mouth.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite good-looking, but his nutritional supply seemed uneven. He must have lacked a crucial bit of brain function, as there was a glob of ketchup smeared on his straight nose, though it was unclear how it got there—truly a unique character.
 

 
This was the final small group willing to invest and make money with Wei Zekai and her.
 

 
The group consisted of only seven people in total, with clear roles of president and vice president.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the president, and everyone gave him the nickname "Philanthropic Gambler.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was the vice president, not because the others thought she was inferior to Wei Zekai, but because she was responsible for stopping the president from turning investment into charity.
 

 
The second-generation rich were not merely ignorant. They had received high-quality education and understood business and investment knowledge better than children from ordinary families. They could deduce why a business would succeed based on results, but when it came to starting a business from scratch and making money...
 

 
They were at a loss.
 

 
Originally, everyone thought this was just a new kind of social gathering for eating, drinking, and spending money, with the chance to get to know the hot and popular Tong Zhao and take some pictures to show off on social media. However, after sitting down and listening to Tong Zhao’s series of personal speeches...
 

 
They realized how knowledgeable Tong Zhao was.
 

 
The more they listened, the more they realized.
 

 
It seemed like it really had potential!
 

 
In the past, Tong Zhao had managed to gather a group of followers during the apocalypse. Now, in peacetime, persuading others to make money with her was not difficult, especially when dealing with pampered young masters and mistresses who had never experienced significant hardships.
 

 
By the end of the afternoon, they were convinced that listening to Tong Zhao would eventually lead to big profits.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought that if she weren’t acting, she might have become a successful pyramid scheme leader and made a fortune.
 

 
“Ning Zhiyi thinks I like him,” Tong Zhao said casually.
 

 
Second-Generation A: “Ning Zhiyi really has too high an opinion of himself. I can’t wait to see his reaction when he finds out we’ve made money.”
 

 
Second-Generation B handed Wei Zekai a tissue to wipe the ketchup from his nose: “Don’t even mention it. My brother was on good terms with him. I had persuaded my brother to join, but after Ning Zhiyi talked him out of it, he stood me up today. It’s so annoying.”
 

 
…
 

 
In the shabby room, a group of not-so-promising young rakes had gathered.
 

 
The high-quality cigarettes that Wei Zekai had bought for Tong Zhao were also divided among them.
 

 
To be honest, Tong Zhao thought they were a bunch of simpletons.
 

 
But what did it matter if they were simpletons? Just like in many stories where the protagonist enjoys being favored by a group, the most important thing in life is to be on the right team.
 

 
And the biggest advantage of these simpletons was that they had chosen her.
 

 
Simpleton C: “Strategist, I want to take a photo with you!”
 

 
…
 

 
Tong Zhao lifted her chin: “Alright, come over.”
 

 
*
 

 
After finalizing the investment plans, Tong Zhao went to participate in the promotional program for “Countdown 72 Hours.”
 

 
Since it was Duan Ge's performance, she also took charge of this interview, gladly taking a break.
 

 
The interview included some common mini-games, and the content of the games was directly taken from the film. Tong Zhao sat in the makeup room, having her makeup touched up by the artist while flipping through the script, worried that the director might ask her to perform a demonstration of her marksmanship.
 

 
In the end, the program team asked her to perform some shooting skills on stage.
 

 
They used a temporary shooting range, originally intended to show the audience the difference between reality and holographic filming, emphasizing that being a cool sharpshooter isn't as easy as it seems. However...
 

 
Holding a real gun similar to the one used in the film, Tong Zhao wore safety goggles and earmuffs.
 

 
She was dressed in a bright red cocktail dress with high heels, a stark contrast to her more neutral, professional attire in the film. Yet, after pulling the trigger and achieving a score of 200 hits from 20 shots, no one could see her as just a pretty face.
 

 
Why?
 

 
Despite her beautiful appearance, she was remarkably formidable.
 

 
Duan Ge: [Is this all you wanted me to do?]
 

 
Duan Ge curled her lips with a hint of disdain.
 

 
That smug, over-the-top smile was captured in a close-up by the production team, adding an extra layer of shine to her fierce persona.
 

 
Anna and Tang Jingjie clapped excitedly, letting the audience know that the lead actor had good chemistry.
 

 
Only Xu Zhu stared blankly at her step-sister.
 

 
There was no venomous jealousy to prompt netizens to write more negative commentary. However, her dazed and out-of-sorts appearance meant she couldn’t grab any camera time or opportunities to shine. All the spotlight went to Tong Zhao.
 

 
When did the step-sister learn to shoot?
 

 
Xu Zhu was a bit unsettled.
 

 
But it wasn’t surprising; wealthy children often learn a wide range of things—piano, flower arranging, skiing, extreme sports. There are plenty of extravagant ways to spend money.
 

 
During the interview, Tong Zhao was specifically asked a few questions that netizens were curious about.
 

 
“Your two characters are quite different, but since it’s a primal instinct film, which one do you think is closer to the real you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Feng Yanqi. I am very ambitious; the Empress often has to act against her will.”
 

 
Against her will.
 

 
Seeing this interview, Ming Emperor Song Wanzhuo felt as if he had experienced heartbreak all over again.
 

 
When the topic of "acting against one's will" came up, her tone suddenly softened, likely due to thoughts of the Empress.
 

 
The male host grinned mischievously and said, “So, among the ‘Zhao Jie CP’ with Tang Jingjie, it seems the female lead’s name is ranked first this year. I heard this is... implying the dominant role, right?”
 

 
The female host nodded knowingly.
 

 
Tang Jingjie’s face flushed red.
 

 
“It’s normal,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, not at all shy about the scandal, turned to smile at Tang Jingjie and reached out to drape her arm over his shoulder. “When I stand next to him, the roles of dominant and submissive are quite clear, right?”
 

 
As soon as the answer was given, the studio erupted in laughter without needing any cues from the stage crew.
 

 
Tang Jingjie, covering his face in resignation, said, “I wish I were half as handsome as Sister Zhao.”
 

 
The host responded, “It’s okay, the fans just love your cuteness.”
 

 
Tong Zhao and Tang Jingjie’s CP was essentially a pairing that happened halfway through, without much fanfare.
 

 
The buzz around Ming Emperor X Empress is far behind.
 

 
It’s clear that the dominant-male, submissive-female dynamic is mainstream.
 

 
However, this does not affect Tong Zhao's fan base.
 

 
On the contrary, most of her followers are career-oriented fans who do not want her to be involved in romance or interact with male celebrities. They prefer her to remain independent and exclusive.
 

 
After this episode aired, the video of Tong Zhao using a real gun again topped the trending searches.
 

 
Before it even fell off the trending list, she moved on to filming the promotional video for *Be Careful, Sea King*, where she met the five people who would live with her in the holographic world for a month.
 

 
Reality shows in this format emphasize authenticity, so not all participants are celebrities.
 

 
Many are influencers or just ordinary people.
 

 
The only common trait they share is that they all look quite good.
 

 
However...
 

 
After greeting the director, Tong Zhao walked over to a man with dyed golden-brown hair and tapped Male Contestant Number One on the shoulder:
 

 
“Charity Gambling King, explain why you are here.”
 

 
“Call me Mingzun,”
 

 
Today, Young Master Wei was wearing a shorter black shirt, and when he lifted his arm, the tattoo on his abs was visible, making Tong Zhao think he might need an extra layer; “Didn’t I say? I invest in any show you’re involved in. The director thought I had a talent for acting and invited me to join. Everything’s all set, and I’m free!”
 

 
He seemed quite excited: “Let me tell you, this show is the first time our Mingzun and Anzun are collaborating, and we absolutely can’t mess it up.”
 

 
From Wei Zekai’s brief explanation, strategist Tong Zhao had already deduced the truth.
 

 
The director must have seen Wei Zekai’s good looks and wealthy background, figuring he’d be a great addition to the show and persuaded him to join.
 

 
“Wei Zekai,”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him thoughtfully: “Do you know this isn’t a movie shoot? You’re here to find romance.”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...What?”
# Chapter26
Tong Zhao spent five minutes explaining what a dating reality show is.
 

 
Wei Zekai was stunned.
 

 
He pointed to himself and asked, "Is it real dating? Not acting?"
 

 
Well, it's not really real dating.
 

 
The scheming of people's hearts in a reality show is different from reality. However, quite a few who pair up on the show end up seeing each other as soulmates afterward because they've seen the truest side of each other's souls. "This show has a storyline and background setting. In a bit, we'll draw identity cards. Who knows, you might go from being a rich second-generation heir to a pauper."
 

 
"It doesn't matter."
 

 
Wei Zekai seemed quite confident.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought it made sense, after all, he was a handsome guy, and there were always a lot of girls who liked him back in school.
 

 
But it turned out his confidence came from something else: "I am spiritually rich, and I have personal charisma."
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him but didn't see any sign of spiritual richness.
 

 
Just as she was about to ruffle his golden-brown hair, she saw a man with a strong, chiseled face, dressed in a casual suit, walking over and greeting the two of them, "Hello, I am Contestant No. 2, He Shun." He pointed to the small square name tag on his chest and smiled at Tong Zhao. "I’m your fan. May I shake your hand?"
 

 
Tong Zhao politely shook his hand.
 

 
Although he claimed to be her fan, He Shun remained very restrained and didn't take advantage of the situation. Maybe it was because the cameras were rolling. "I’m the boss of Feiteng Capital, so you could say I'm a somewhat well-known investor. But recently, my sharpest investment was still on the first episode of 'The Legend of Emperor Ming' when you appeared. Really, I knew you had potential from the very first episode."
 

 
He looked down at Tong Zhao, his eyes burning with intensity.
 

 
It was the kind of gaze a man has when he sees someone he is attracted to.
 

 
Off to the side, Wei Zekai’s internal alarm bells went off, and he quickly cut in to introduce himself: "My surname is Wei, Wei Zekai. I mainly focus on charity... no, I mean, investment as well. I’ve been investing in Tong Zhao since a long time ago. Back in elementary school, when she played the lead role in a play, I cast my vote for her as the Best Young Actress."
 

 
Tong Zhao was his only successful project to date.
 

 
The more popular Tong Zhao became, the more it proved that Wei Zekai had a good eye for investments.
 

 
Damn old man, he also wants to compete with him for the position of the first investor!
 

 
"......"
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a bit too embarrassed to watch.
 

 
Just then, the host called for everyone to gather and draw cards, so the three of them stopped talking and headed to the center of the room.
 

 
The walls of this room were painted pink, with red balloons and ribbons everywhere. The lighting created a shimmering visual effect, making the setup look like a proposal scene.
 

 
"Let me reintroduce our show."
 

 
"The official name is *Beware of the Sea King*, but it can also be called *Sea King Killer*."
 

 
In front of the host was a box, with a stack of demonstration cards next to it.
 

 
He held up a card featuring a person in black clothing wearing a dog mask: “This is the Judge. While enjoying the process of dating, whoever draws this card has the responsibility to identify the 'Sea King' hiding among you and expose the true nature of the players who are insincere in love! The Judge has a mysterious special ability, which only the player who draws this card will know about. For now, let’s keep it a secret.”
 

 
[Judge]
 

 
The second and third cards the host raised happened to be a pair of elegantly dressed man and woman standing back to back.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
"For the players who draw the Sea King card, your task is to make everyone fall in love with you within the given time and collect declarations of true love from all participants."
 

 
"Note that among you six players, there will be one male Sea King and one female Sea King. Our show is very gender-equal; no matter whether you’re a man or a woman, everyone has a chance to experience the hardships of love."
 

 
"And regardless of whether you are a Sea King, Judge, or a regular player, there is a ‘True Love’ app on your phone. This is the app you will use to express your feelings. Its function is quite simple."
 

 
The host opened an app with a pink heart icon on their phone: "You can use it to send messages to other players, and you can also enter the name of the player you have feelings for.”
 

 
A huge peach-pink heart appeared, with a space in the middle where you could indeed enter a name.
 

 
Romantic music started playing at just the right moment—
 

 
"I have never been so certain, so sure, about who would be my destiny..."
 

 
"Please remember, once you enter a player's name, it cannot be changed."
 

 
"Until your halo descends into my dark night..."
 

 
A delicate-looking girl with glasses timidly raised her hand, "What if we realize the person is a Sea King after entering their name?"
 

 
The music stopped abruptly.
 

 
The host smiled slightly.
 

 
This smile was a bit different; it clashed slightly with the warm and sweet atmosphere of the setup:
 

 
"Then you still can't change it. After all, in reality, even if most of us find out our partners are jerks, it's hard to let them go."
 

 
The girl with glasses pressed her lips together, her eyes turning red; she was also a player with a story.
 

 
"The condition for the commoners to win is to mutually become each other's true love."
 

 
"For the Sea King, the goal is to make everyone fall in love with them."
 

 
"Note that if a player doesn't feel moved or fall for anyone, and safely makes it through the entire show, they can win a cash prize and earn the title of [Solitary King]!"
 

 
Before drawing the cards, everyone had to introduce themselves. The girl with glasses was named Zhong Muxi. She said she no longer trusted men after being hurt by a jerk and didn't need love anymore, claiming she would definitely not fall for the Sea King's tricks: "On this show, not falling in love is the rule for winning, so as long as I don't draw the Sea King card, I'm confident I'll get the Solitary King's prize."
 

 
The crowd generously applauded her.
 

 
Concubine Chen was unimpressed: "The more someone claims they’ll never love again, the harder they usually fall the next time. Love and men are both wonderful things; it’s just that her experience with one was bad. Someone in their early twenties saying such naive things is likely to be deceived again."
 

 
The female reporter laughed: "I suspect you’re talking about Master Lu Xian and even have evidence to prove it."
 

 
Concubine Chen: "Let’s all chant together like Master Lu Xian: 'Solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary, solitary.'"
 

 
It was Wei Zekai's turn. He swaggered up to draw a card, only to have his hand held back by the host, who told him he needed to introduce himself first.
 

 
Young Master Wei was a bit stunned. Wherever he went before, everyone already knew who he was.
 

 
But in the entertainment industry, he was a nobody.
 

 
The male guests all seemed to want to showcase themselves, especially He Shun, who earlier had an impressive self-introduction, boasting his title as an investor and sharing his shining success stories. However, Tong Zhao knew that, at present, Wei Zekai was just a student taking online courses, not good at anything, and best known for losing money.
 

 
Sure enough, he said, "I’m Wei Zekai, born into the wealthy second-generation by talent, currently a university student, and planning to transition into an investor in the future."
 

 
Amid the uproarious laughter, Tong Zhao really wanted to turn her face away and not look at this fool.
 

 
However, the female guest Chang Xiaonian, who had previously said she’d never been in a relationship, was staring at him with bright eyes, as if she genuinely saw his spiritual richness and extraordinary personal charm.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to go up, the finale.
 

 
"Do I also have to introduce myself?”
 

 
She was the only celebrity among them, and the host smiled and nodded.
 

 
Tong Zhao naturally showcased herself in front of the camera, her flawless beauty radiating a confident ease. As she casually glanced around, her dazzling presence captivated everyone, leaving both men and women momentarily stunned. "I’m Tong Zhao, a newcomer in Instinct Films. Fans on Weibo often say they’re curious about what I’d be like in a relationship. Since dating in real life isn’t possible, I’ve come on this show to have some fun."
 

 
The host seized the opportunity to ask curiously, "Why can't you date in real life? Does your manager not allow it?"
 

 
"No time."
 

 
Tong Zhao spread her hands in a helpless gesture.
 

 
It’s partly because she’s busy, and partly because it’s hard to please everyone.
 

 
Although each persona is still her, just as a woman's preferences in partners can change throughout her life, each of her different personas has its own slight preferences. Then there’s Han Zhi, who she can't quite figure out if he likes men or women.
 

 
So, until she meets a man who can accept her fully...
 

 
Forget it, no need to trouble anyone.
 

 
Finally, the host let her draw a card.
 

 
Everyone would draw two cards: one for their apparent role setting and one for their special identity card.
 

 
The two cards Tong Zhao drew were...
 

 
[Student]
 

 
Message: With zero dating experience, only by studying hard can you earn life points.
 

 
[Sea King]
 

 
Message: A great beauty wants to keep multiple suitors—there’s no one you can’t take away.
 

 
After reading the contents of the cards, Tong Zhao put them away without a hint of emotion on her face. She could feel that she was the focus of everyone’s gaze, with each person observing her expression for clues. Since this was just a warm-up promo, lingering too long wouldn’t be good, so after everyone had drawn their cards, the host announced that the filming for the day was over.
 

 
Wei Zekai eagerly came over and whispered, "I drew a super awesome identity, but I won’t tell you now!"
 

 
"Even if you told me, you’d forget such key information after entering the reality show," she replied.
 

 
Tong Zhao waved goodbye to the host, director, and crew.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, "Shall I give you a ride back? Today, I’m driving a green car—it goes perfectly with my outfit today."
 

 
Young Master Wei's level of material wealth was just that ridiculous.
 

 
While an average rich second-generation might choose a car based on their mood, he had the same model in every color, just to match his daily outfits.
 

 
"Sister Chu assigned me an assistant and a driver, so I don't need a ride."
 

 
"Oh."
 

 
The two walked side by side to the underground parking lot. Young Master Wei glanced in the direction Tong Zhao indicated and spotted a dull gray nanny van, showing a look of barely concealed disdain.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew he was about to give his "high opinions" again, so she reminded him, "Keep it high EQ."
 

 
"This car of yours..."
 

 
Wei Zekai managed to squeeze out a compliment: "It’s pretty safe. Just looking at it, you can tell it won’t get hijacked."

The preview video of this reality show aired, and it unexpectedly received a good response.
 

 
Tong Zhao was recently in the spotlight, and netizens were very curious about her. She was a treasure yet to be fully discovered, especially since she was appearing on a reality show that couldn’t hide one's true nature... It was quite bold, and netizens' prying curiosity reached new heights, with discussions on major forums and websites fervently rising:
 

 
“Anyone who has seen *Countdown* knows Tong Zhao is set to be the Solitary Queen. She’s stunning on her own and doesn’t need a man.”
 

 
“Waiting to see Concubine Chen slay the entire scene. Is there really a man who can escape the Empress's grasp?”
 

 
“The wealthy second-generation is hilarious! Seems like he already knows Tong Zhao? Could he be her boyfriend outside the industry?”
 

 
Opinions on Tong Zhao among drama fans were as polarized as a diode.
 

 
Those from *The Legend of Emperor Ming* thought she was the Sea King.
 

 
Those who got into the fandom from *Countdown* felt she didn’t need a man at all and seemed like a tough, ironclad woman.
 

 
Controversy breeds heat, and the director felt his decision to involve Wei Zekai was absolutely correct. This handsome and charismatic young man was a natural focal point. Netizens quickly dug up his Weibo, Instagram, and even his gaming affiliations, discovering that he was a genuine wealthy second-generation heir, but…
 

 
"The second-generation heir photo dug up from Wei Zekai's Weibo—The question is, whose old, shabby background is that?"
 

 
This post generated a lot of discussion and went viral that afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai was shocked.
 

 
His first thought wasn’t about his privacy being violated.
 

 
He sent two WeChat messages to Tong Zhao:
 

 
"I told you the place you rented couldn't be lived in!"
 

 
"It seems this generation of netizens isn't very emotionally intelligent either!"
# Chapter27
The manager also sent Tong Zhao the related news.
 

 
Since Wei Zekai's Weibo post caused a stir, the subsequent reactions included sharp-eyed netizens discovering that Tong Zhao and that group of rich second-generation heirs were all mutual followers on Weibo. Furthermore, in that group photo, she was definitely in the center position, not looking like a small star being casually played with by the second-generation heirs, but rather like a close friend.
 

 
[Hasn't anyone dug up Tong Zhao's background yet?]
 

 
[A post from her middle school classmate on the eighth forum group says her family is very wealthy and that she's in the same circle as these second-generation heirs.]
 

 
[Wealthy but living in an old, shabby place? The nanny car Tong Zhao uses is also quite low-end.] (Wei Zekai secretly liked this post)
 

 
Tong Zhenming didn't want to give his eldest daughter a "white and rich" image, so he naturally wouldn't admit it directly, and Xu Zhu felt the same way.
 

 
Coincidentally, Tong Zhao perfectly agreed with them on this.
 

 
Who would care about being the Tong family’s daughter?
 

 
If it weren’t for the fact that her mother’s last name was Tong, she would have changed her surname before debuting.
 

 
As a result, the real information was ignored, while the false information was spread convincingly—
 

 
It was said that Tong Zhao came from a grassroots background, which was why she had a tough and resilient subconscious.
 

 
Which rich young lady hasn’t been pampered and cherished growing up? Who could have the courage to face challenges without any help?
 

 
“Is Wei Zekai your boyfriend? It’s fine if you're really in love, and you two do seem to match. Just remember not to let your manager be the last person to know about your relationship.”
 

 
Sister Chu asked.
 

 
“It’s not true. I’ll have him clarify…”
 

 
Just as Tong Zhao thought she might have a chance to fight back, she realized that she and Wei Zekai would soon be filming a dating reality show together. Given her identity card, she would definitely have to flirt with Wei, and anything could happen. She decided to stop talking: “In any case, we’re not dating. If we were, would I still be living in that small apartment? I’d have to respond, right? As if nothing happened?”
 

 
Sister Chu said it was fine since she had her own work.
 

 
In the era of Instinct Films, the moral standards for "actors" had dropped to a new low.
 

 
After all, it’s instinctual; anything can happen in a show.
 

 
For example, Xu Zhu’s character, Feng Sisi, once faced widespread online criticism but didn’t lose all her opportunities. On the contrary, her deeply selfish portrayal attracted a group of self-interested fans and offered more negative roles.
 

 
As long as the “true self” has character and charm, it can keep attracting attention over time.
 

 
“Alright.”
 

 
Tong Zhao decided not to respond publicly and also instructed her team to stay silent.
 

 
Once the investment results come through, the rumors will naturally die down.
 

 
Her team liked this feeling of holding back their big move and agreed unanimously with Tong Zhao’s request to ignore the netizens' speculations about their relationship. Thus, the public perception of Tong Zhao settled into the image of a “grassroots girl who gets along well with the second-generation heirs.”
 

 
The controversy over the group photo cooled down significantly after that.
 

 
Just because of that photo, Tong Zhao's residence was dug up by keen-eyed netizens, and that very day, some fans showed up at her door asking for autographs. Feeling helpless, she had to borrow some money from Wei Zekai and move to a community with better security—
 

 
Given her current level of fame, she indeed couldn’t afford to live in a poor place any longer.
 

 
Wei Zekai, knowing he was in the wrong, personally drove her to the move.
 

 
Seeing her furniture nearly deforming his sports car, Tong Zhao sighed with a tinge of discomfort.
 

 
"I spent more on moving company services than you’d spend fixing this car," she remarked.
 

 
Young Master Wei wasn’t pleased with this comment.
 

 
He thought his driving skills were a hundred thousand times better than those of the moving company: "I can reach your new home in ten minutes; this car goes from 0 to 100 in just 2.9 seconds..."
 

 
"City speed limits, thank you."
 

 
※
 

 
Once the moving ordeal was over, the day for filming *Sea King Killer* arrived in the blink of an eye.
 

 
The director added all the cast members to a WeChat group so they could get to know each other in advance.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t check the conversations in the group, and Wei Zekai had directly muted them.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, enthusiastically added her as a friend. Since she needed to interact with him for work, she accepted the request and took the opportunity to learn more about her potential target— the female Sea King corresponds to all the male players. She asked Concubine Chen to also check out his social media.
 

 
He Shun’s social media was very glamorous and filled with the aura of successful individuals.
 

 
“The appreciation of RMB is the most important factor in offshore RMB liquidity expectations...”
 

 
“Next week, I will be giving a lecture at K University as an alumnus...”
 

 
“Self-discipline is a prerequisite for success [Fist][Fist]”
 

 
“Appropriate rest is also important! [Attached a filtered snapshot of first-class cabin with a Mac]”
 

 
Concubine Chen: “What a boring man. If His Majesty posted something like, ‘Have you seen the Golden Hall at 4 a.m.? Do you know how hard I work?’ I would vomit.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed: “Haven’t we seen him in person? Let’s analyze based on his social media.”
 

 
Concubine Chen, having the leisure to indulge her, responded: “He probably doesn’t listen to others. His politeness in front of women is just an act. Once someone is out of his control, his true nature will show. However, if you go along with his temperament, you’ll quickly fall under his spell.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed; he was indeed the type she had no interest in.
 

 
He Shun, on the other hand, had a lot of interest in her and invited her twice, but she had to refuse due to scheduling conflicts.
 

 
Concubine Chen, growing a bit annoyed, said: “Let him try a few more times. I’ll make him regret it and give him a psychological scar about women.”
 

 
The other personas were in awe.
 

 
The filming set for *Sea King Killer* was located in the villa area of the film city.
 

 
The holographic variety show would last for more than half a month, and the actors couldn’t stay in the set all the time. Therefore, medical teams and fitness trainers were provided to ensure that actors left the set daily for their required exercise to prevent muscle atrophy. This was a government mandate to prevent exploitative practices by unscrupulous production teams.
 

 
Tong Zhao was the last to arrive.
 

 
By the time she arrived, it was already quite late, and she found that the guest lineup was not complete; a male guest was missing.
 

 
Seeing her arrival, the director immediately approached her to explain: “Here’s the situation. The third male guest, Lu Yiqi… he’s in custody and won’t be able to make it to the shoot.”
 

 
“In custody?”
 

 
“For drunk driving.”
 

 
Tong Zhao understood; it seemed he was temporarily out of reach.
 

 
For holographic variety shows exceeding ten days of filming, due to certain risks, applications had to be reported in advance. Missing one person was acceptable, but adding one more was a serious legal issue, so the crew couldn’t find a replacement: “We’re filming with one less person?”
 

 
The director looked resigned: “It has to be this way, but there’s another issue…”
 

 
“You can go ahead.”
 

 
“Lu Yiqi drew the male Sea King card.”
 

 
That’s really problematic.
 

 
The Sea King has a key role; missing one significantly reduces the appeal.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but glance at Wei Zekai, suspecting that his bad luck was affecting everything he was involved in.
 

 
“Others don’t know yet. Our production team has discussed and has a somewhat unwelcome request,” the director said, biting his lip as he revealed their solution: “We can create a new male model for you. This way, your Sea King card in the show will have the ability to transform.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao was stunned for a moment.
 

 
Realizing that the idea was a bit outrageous, the director adopted a very humble stance and pleaded with her: “The pre-show hype has been so great, and we really don’t want to let this show, which is about to become a hit, slip away. We will also give you more screen time and opportunities to perform. What do you think?”
 

 
What did she think?
 

 
The more she looked at it, the more she felt that this director and the dog system were cut from the same cloth.
 

 
At that time, she had no preparation at all; she had just been transmigrated into a young, handsome guy named Han Zhi and lived a life as a man. Consequently, her mental palace also gained a male persona…
 

 
“Alright, but the model has to be handsome.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a deep breath and woke up the well-rested Han Zhi in her mind.
 

 
[Brother Zhi, get up and get to work.]
# Chapter28
Playing dual roles is almost impossible in instinctive films.
 

 
The vast majority of people's consciousness isn't strong enough to sustain it.
 

 
The director sought out Tong Zhao because the difference in character between Concubine Gui and Feng Yanqi is particularly large, and it's guessed that she has the best chance of handling it.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the medical team prepared for her by conducting a full set of brain scans and simple psychological tests to ensure her health wouldn’t be affected. They also assured her: “Dividing a person's consciousness into two parts can easily become particularly one-sided and extreme. We will explain to the audience that this is an exceptional case. If the modeling fails during the film, then… we’ll just have to accept losing one guest!”
 

 
In the end, everything was normal.
 

 
However, the medical team was puzzled by a set of codes in Tong Zhao's brain that could not be decrypted and were quite numerous. They suggested she visit a more specialized hospital or research institute for a check-up after filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled but remained silent.
 

 
The other guests, unaware of the change in situation, had already settled into the filming cabin early.
 

 
To split into two virtual models, the production team temporarily applied for the highest-level filming cabin, allowing Tong Zhao to sit alone in a more sophisticated filming device, covered in sensors. She closed her eyes, feeling a bit uneasy.
 

 
Han Zhi comforted her: "Don’t worry, the worst-case scenario is just that I’ll end up in the female model."
 

 
Concubine Gui: "I’m very worried. I don’t want to be a tofu grinder!"
 

 
…
 

 
Other personalities, along with Tong Zhao, gave sidelong glances at Concubine Gui's harsh words.
 

 
Under the influence of medication, Tong Zhao fell into a deep sleep.
 

 
…
 

 
"Can it really work?"
 

 
Backstage, the assistant director voiced everyone's concerns.
 

 
There have been cases of a person playing dual roles before.
 

 
There was an actor with a very strong “id” who, in a film exploring the self, split off another version of himself. As a result, he ended up with two extremely contrasting roles: one was aggressive and domineering towards subordinates, while the other was timid and insecure, craving others’ approval… In fact, combined, they represented the actor's true “id.” Every personality has both positive and negative sides, and theoretically, it should be possible.
 

 
But this was a renowned actor with a strong subconscious!
 

 
After being honed through dozens of instinctive films, Tong Zhao's consciousness thickness couldn't compare to someone who had acted in only two works.
 

 
A props team member muttered, “At worst, just act really effeminate. Anyway, Tong Zhao is good-looking, so being effeminate can be seen as being a pretty boy.”
 

 
“Success in separation!”
 

 
“Compatibility 100%, deployment can proceed.”
 

 
After a busy period for the backstage staff, Tong Zhao's consciousness was successfully split into two—
 

 
Countless people are curious about the composition of the soul.
 

 
Does the soul have weight?
 

 
What happens when a person loses their soul?
 

 
What exactly is the soul?
 

 
Is it in the heart or the brain?
 

 
The director sighed: “The code deconstructed from this scan should represent a person’s soul!”
 

 
※
 

 
On a perfectly sunny afternoon.
 

 
Wei Zekai got out of a luxury car with a suitcase and walked up to a mansion.
 

 
The mansion was surrounded by tall walls with greenery, and it had its own courtyard with the elegant sound of a small bridge and flowing water. From any angle, it could be called a mansion. However, Wei Zekai, wearing silver noise-canceling headphones, frowned slightly as he looked over the high-cost rental model code for the mansion used by the production team, clicking his tongue and saying, “This?”
 

 
…
 

 
“Can we drop a set of bird droppings code on him now? It should be quite explosive, right? The audience will support me! Modeling team, don’t you want to teach him a lesson?”
 

 
A props team member, who had developed a bit of envy toward the wealthy, earnestly sought advice from the modeling team.
 

 
To enhance the realism of the instinctive variety show, after the filming begins, guests are unaware that they are being recorded the entire time and only know they need to complete the task at hand. The brain automatically disregards any strange aspects.
 

 
For example, Wei Zekai's role, like in real life, is that of a super-rich second-generation heir. The production team discovered that viewers were very interested in his wealthy background, believing it would create good chemistry on the show.
 

 
At this moment, Wei Zekai was portrayed as someone sent by his family to stay here for a month while also searching for a partner.
 

 
As he walked into the mansion, he answered a call from home: “I’ve arrived. Got it, stop nagging. If you keep insisting I bring a girlfriend back, I’ll bring a boyfriend back to surprise you!”
 

 
Of course, this was also a call arranged by the production team.
 

 
Combined with the voiceover and subtitles added in post-production, the audience quickly learned the current situation of the guests: they were to live in the mansion for a month and develop relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai did not disappoint the production team; his brief words effectively painted the image of a rebellious young man.
 

 
He turned the door handle and found three people already waiting inside.
 

 
Passing through the foyer, the entrance led to a spacious and luxurious living room. The three-story structure included multifunctional rooms, a maid’s room, a wine cellar, and numerous bedrooms, too many to count. Since everyone was required to gather first, three people were scattered on the living room sofa.
 

 
A young girl wearing glasses and another sweet-looking girl were whispering to each other, while a stern-looking man sat in an armchair, giving Wei Zekai a polite smile.
 

 
“The rooms on the second floor without nameplates are free to choose. You can put your luggage in a room first. There are still two people who haven’t arrived yet,” said the sweet girl in response to Wei Zekai’s puzzled look. “I’m Chang Xiaonian. The girl with glasses is Zhong Muxi, and this is Mr. He.”
 

 
“You don’t have a name?”
 

 
Wei Zekai turned to the man.
 

 
Mr. He smiled and said, “Just call me He Shun.”
 

 
“I’m Wei Zekai. Feel free to call me however you like.”
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced around the second floor, with the camera following his movements.
 

 
He looked back at the three people downstairs with confusion: “Aren’t there only maid’s rooms on the second floor? They’re so small!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi: “……”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian calmly responded, “The rooms are all the same size. They’re not small at all.”
 

 
In the instinctive variety show, Wei Zekai's emotional intelligence was on full display.
 

 
The backstage staff were tempted to arrange a bit of "heavenly bird droppings" for him.
 

 
Previously, the three who arrived first had marveled at the luxurious accommodations provided by the activity, saying it felt like a vacation. Anyone in such an environment would likely be inspired to pursue a romantic relationship!
 

 
Zhong Muxi had a poor impression of him and muttered quietly, “How can he be like this? The rooms are already very nice.”
 

 
“Wei Zekai… that name sounds familiar.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took out her phone to look him up online.
 

 
Of course, the information she found was about the character's background arranged by the production team.
 

 
But it was not much different from the real Wei Zekai.
 

 
Displayed before the two were countless names of industries and chain groups, along with some news highlighting his immense wealth. Zhong Muxi clicked her tongue in disdain and felt even less favorably towards him: “Someone this rich must definitely not lack women.”
 

 
“I actually think he’s pretty good,” Chang Xiaonian said, her eyes showing admiration after discovering Wei Zekai’s great wealth.
 

 
After Wei Zekai came downstairs, Chang Xiaonian took the initiative to explain the details of the activity.
 

 
It was similar to what the host had introduced earlier, but with added details about daily life.
 

 
“You must return to the mansion and clock in every night, and you can’t engage in any intimate behaviors like kissing or hugging. You can only choose one person as your romantic interest,” Chang Xiaonian read from the booklet. Seeing the "sea king" rules, Wei Zekai clicked his tongue again and said, “What the heck, a sea king? I despise people like that the most! It’s a desecration of pure love!”
 

 
……
 

 
The backstage staff were all shocked.
 

 
Their impression of the wealthy second-generation heir was rather stereotypical, and Wei Zekai’s reveal of a mermaid tattoo during the pre-show recording only added to his Playboy image. They didn’t expect his “true self” to make such a cliché statement about “pure love.”
 

 
Director: “...Instinctive variety shows are truly full of surprises.”
 

 
The writer, excited, said: “We could add a ‘Judge’s Comment’ effect in post-production. It turns out giving him that card was spot on.”
 

 
Wei Zekai plopped down into an armchair, acting all high and mighty.
 

 
“There are still two people missing. No sense of time at all, so disappointing.” After complaining, he put on his noise-canceling headphones and started playing a mobile game.
 

 
The wait extended from a clear afternoon to a cloudy evening.
 

 
Soon, the villa was enveloped in heavy rain, with occasional thunder adding a touch of a crime scene atmosphere reminiscent of a Conan murder case. It wasn’t really the fault of the “two people” for lacking a sense of time; it was because Tong Zhao was undergoing consciousness splitting and reorganization, which delayed her entry into the holographic space.
 

 
“The weather is so bad. Do you think they might come tomorrow instead?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked softly.
 

 
She wasn’t very confident in her own words and immediately turned her gaze to Chang Xiaonian, who had just become her friend. As Chang Xiaonian was about to speak, the door was opened—
 

 
In the foyer stood a young girl enveloped in a transparent raincoat.
 

 
Beneath the raincoat, she wore a pure white chiffon dress, the hem of which did not reach her knees. Her slender, beautiful legs were bathed in the soft light of the foyer, giving her skin a flawless, creamy appearance.
 

 
The raincoat was slightly oversized, making the girl seem even smaller, as if only her palm-sized face was peeking into the living room. Her light-colored eyes reflected a mix of innocent bewilderment and curiosity about the new place.
 

 
Even the production team, who had seen Tong Zhao in person before, were astonished by her appearance.
 

 
The director was a bit surprised: “She doesn’t look like Feng Yanqi at all.”
 

 
“Actually, she doesn’t look like Concubine Gui either.”
 

 
“No, she does,” said the staff member, a fan of Tong Zhao, who had gotten into it through *The Legend of Ming Dynasty* and had repeatedly watched the edited videos on Bilibili: “She looks especially like Concubine Gui when she first entered the palace!”
 

 
Enchanting men is an art, a skill that Concubine Gui absorbed from her experiences in the harem.
 

 
Starting with a weak position is always a safe choice.
 

 
……
 

 
“Sorry, I got stuck in traffic due to the typhoon.”
 

 
Tong Zhao spoke with a voice that was both soft and delicate, more pleasing than a nightingale's song.
 

 
She looked like a small white flower battered by a storm, innocent and pitiable.
 

 
The character background template implanted in Tong Zhao’s mind was that of a financially struggling female student.
 

 
Her parents had passed away, her grandmother was critically ill, and she needed to win this event to secure the prize money for her grandmother’s medical expenses and her own tuition fees.
 

 
After seeing Tong Zhao's entrance, the director decided to have the voiceover introduce this background immediately.
 

 
From the moment she appeared, the audience became curious about this seemingly poisonous white flower.
 

 
“Am I the last one?” She frowned, looking very apologetic.
 

 
“No, there’s one more. You’re not the last to arrive.”
 

 
He Shun came to his senses, immediately stood up from the sofa, and took her luggage with a warm but not overly familiar attitude, explaining the details of the event. After receiving a grateful and admiring look from the pretty girl, he volunteered to help carry her luggage to her room.
 

 
Tong Zhao seemed uninterested in the other female guests and instead focused her beautiful eyes on Wei Zekai, who was engrossed in his game.
 

 
[This one seems a bit challenging.]
 

 
The production team captured her inner monologue.
 

 
Clearly, in her view, He Shun was just a simple, easygoing type of man.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually chose a bedroom without fussing over its size.
 

 
He Shun, being very gentlemanly, only carried her luggage into the room and didn’t step further inside. He returned to the living room sofa and explained to everyone, “Tong Zhao needs some time to freshen up before coming downstairs.”
 

 
“If you hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have known her name was Tong Zhao.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian said, a bit dissatisfied.
 

 
Women understand women best, and she immediately had a negative impression of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Since arriving, Tong Zhao’s gaze had only lingered on the men, briefly glancing at the two women, with her focus clearly on the men.
# Chapter29
The heavy rain was still continuing.
 

 
The three of them were hungry, so Chang Xiaonian went to the kitchen first to check the situation.
 

 
The usual pots, plates, spices, and cooking oil were all present, and the full rice jar was reassuring. The refrigerator was packed with drinks. However, there was a very conspicuous sticky note on the fridge:
 

 
[Ingredients in the kitchen are limited and will not be replenished once used.]
 

 
[Please make sure to complete tasks to earn living resources before the ingredients run out]
 

 
After explaining the situation to the others, Chang Xiaonian, a bit embarrassed, said, “I’m sorry, but I only know how to order takeout and make instant noodles…”
 

 
The other two showed similar awkward expressions.
 

 
Here, only Wei Zekai, with his “rich second-generation” identity, had the freedom to use money for takeout. However, given the torrential rain and the remote location of the villa, no delivery person was willing to come. Chang Xiaonian sighed, “Who would deliver without ten times the delivery fee!”
 

 
She glanced at Wei Zekai.
 

 
He looked like someone who didn’t care about the tenfold delivery fee.
 

 
And indeed, he didn’t.
 

 
However, what Wei Zekai said next surprised the staff:
 

 
“Is this a matter of money? With an eighth-level typhoon and torrential rain outside, if a delivery person is tempted by the tenfold fee and something happens to them while delivering, how long would I feel bad about it? I’d be at a loss.”
 

 
How could he...
 

 
Turn such morally high-grounded statements into a pompous rant?
 

 
The production team felt conflicted.
 

 
“I can’t cook either,” He Shun said, looking at the closed door on the second floor. “I don’t know if Tong Zhao can, but she just arrived, so let her rest for a while. Can’t the kitchen have some unpacked food? Surely, she can boil water and cook noodles.”
 

 
Saying this, he seemed just as unwilling to make a move.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at him anxiously.
 

 
She could actually cook, though not particularly well. She had been used as a free maid by her ex for two years, and since the breakup, she had been afraid to show her capable side in front of men... [What’s the use of being capable? Being a nanny to men will only make you seem like an old hag.]
 

 
This bit of negative mental activity was also captured by the AI.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows amplify human traits infinitely; as long as they hit a point of resonance with the audience, they can achieve high ratings.
 

 
Accompanied by the rumbling thunder, the three people with their own agendas fell into silence.
 

 
The door was opened again.
 

 
The man folded his black umbrella. The rain had left droplets on his dark hair, and his white shirt was slightly damp, clinging to his skin and outlining well-defined lines. His chest muscles and abs were enough to make one instinctively swallow. After putting away the umbrella and changing into indoor shoes, he looked up at everyone, revealing an exceptionally handsome face.
 

 
He was stunningly handsome.
 

 
If it weren’t for the sharp jawline, one might believe he was a beautiful woman.
 

 
The man obviously looked tired from the journey; his light amber eyes were not sparkling and lacked the intimidating sharpness. They resembled those of a slightly tipsy traveler, clouded with an indescribable haze, giving anyone a poetic sense of unspoken thoughts.
 

 
He was very tired.
 

 
At that moment, Tong Zhao, having just finished washing her hair and wearing a floral nightgown with half-dry hair, emerged from the bedroom and met his gaze.
 

 
Tong Zhao:
 

 
[Wow, top-notch.]
 

 
“Sorry for arriving a bit late,”
 

 
The man didn’t think much of it and simply smiled at everyone:
 

 
“Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ meaning ‘persistent.’”
 

 
……
 

 
Except for Tong Zhao, the two female guests blushed simultaneously.
 

 
He Shun was handsome among successful people and a looker even among ordinary folks, while Wei Zekai was a young, attractive man who could live off his looks. However, compared to the man in front of them… they fell far short. Even a single glance from Han Zhi was on a completely different level. No woman could resist him, even if he was tired.
 

 
Or perhaps because Han Zhi was tired.
 

 
A handsome and commanding man gives off a sense of pressure. Women are drawn to strength and also have a certain maternal instinct, and Han Zhi embodied the perfect combination of these two qualities.
 

 
Han Zhi was composed; through his eyes, one could feel his rock-solid inner strength. No problem could defeat him, and there was nothing he couldn’t solve. Indecisive and weak-willed? He was certainly someone you could rely on. At the same time, he seemed tired, and if you met his gaze, he would wave you over to rest your head on his shoulder, gently kiss the top of your head, and be tender and affectionate.
 

 
At this moment, the production team’s identity card for him was gradually revealed through special effects and narration:
 

 
【“The King of the Sea” and “Writer” Han Zhi. He is an unknown writer who attracts female readers through his good looks and receives continuous rewards. His book signings are like star meet-and-greets. His editor once lamented that if his writing were a bit better, he wouldn’t be so poor.】
 

 
【Han Zhi’s early life was full of women. He sought fame and praise, was always chasing new interests while getting bored with the old, and no matter how beautiful the woman, she could not stay on his girlfriend’s throne for more than a month.】
 

 
After understanding the current situation, Han Zhi said, “Wait for me to change clothes, and then I’ll make dinner.”
 

 
Hearing that someone volunteered to cook, Wei Zekai took off his headphones and looked at him appreciatively: “Thanks, brother. I’m starving.”
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian regretted not having learned how to cook better.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa drying her hair, which was also a dramatic, murder-like gesture.
 

 
The director was completely unprepared for the normally efficient and sharp Tong Zhao to appear as a naive and cute water lily in this reality show.
 

 
As Tong Zhao dried her hair, she shivered and sneezed.
 

 
She rubbed her red nose, and her unadorned face appeared even more charming.
 

 
She was already a young girl, and with this youthful appearance, she looked like a little loli.
 

 
If Tong Zhao's inner thoughts hadn't been captured, this would indeed be a very cute scene.
 

 
However, the production team clearly heard Tong Zhao, after casting a shy glance at Han Zhi’s waist, think to herself: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
If Han Zhi were another male celebrity, this could have caused a major incident.
 

 
But considering Han Zhi's true identity as an “extreme” type, the production team exchanged a complex look…
 

 
After changing into casual clothes, Han Zhi went straight to the kitchen to cook.
 

 
Soon, a spread of two meat dishes and three vegetable dishes was served on the long table in the living room. Han Zhi also made a mushroom soup. After everyone tasted it, they were captivated by the incredibly fresh and delicious flavor, each person drinking two large bowls.
 

 
He Shun was surprised, "Mr. Han’s cooking skills are really impressive. Young people these days... well, actually me too, are used to eating takeout. We get so used to it that we forget how to cook, and the mere thought of cooking is a headache."
 

 
"My ex-girlfriend had a stomach condition and couldn’t eat takeout," Han Zhi said, laughing at himself. "After we broke up, I didn’t let my cooking skills go to waste. Being able to make sure everyone doesn’t go hungry today is a way for them to come in handy."
 

 
His mastery of language was employed to its fullest extent.
 

 
He didn’t say why they broke up, but how bad could a man who learned to cook for a girlfriend with a stomach issue be? Coupled with his slightly melancholic eyes, his affectionate image was vividly conveyed in just a few sentences.
 

 
Indeed, Zhong Muxi, who remained cautious around all males, cast a sympathetic look toward him.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished a bowl of rice, she looked up with a satisfied smile and said, "I really envy Han Zhi’s girlfriend."
 

 
Her obedient and sweet little loli image was well established.
 

 
But despite how soft and sweet her voice sounded, the intelligent AI scanning of her inner thoughts revealed a starkly contrasting, coldly mocking sentiment:
 

 
[All men’s descriptions of their exes are probably all the same.]
 

 
[Think about it. Which man would brag about being abandoned by an ex? It’s not just about hiding it; they wouldn’t mention it at all. Showing weakness always hides something ulterior—he’s just trying to create a sentimental image.]
 

 
[The cooking is actually quite good.]
 

 
“Same here.”
 

 
Wei Zekai, who enjoyed the meal, chimed in with a somewhat awkward tone.
 

 
And his inner thoughts were quite honest: [Wow, this soup is delicious. I really want to hire him as a personal chef.]
 

 
After the meal, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi took on the responsibility of washing the dishes voluntarily.
 

 
Han Zhi, who cooked, was not expected to wash dishes as well.
 

 
This also highlighted the "true selves" of the remaining three.
 

 
The chauvinistic He Shun thought that anything related to housework had nothing to do with men.
 

 
Wei Zekai always believed that dishes and furniture would clean themselves automatically and that meals would appear hot and ready on time.
 

 
As for Tong Zhao…
 

 
[Fortunately, I wasn’t asked to wash dishes. But if I were, I’d need to find a good tool to help.]
 

 
The production team: "..."
 

 
This is just too lazy!
 

 
Is Tong Zhao really this lazy?
 

 
Feng Yanqi’s character was not like this!
 

 
The assistant director clicked his tongue in amazement: “Good looks really give an advantage. I actually don’t find her annoying. She’s like a kitten looking for a caretaker, glancing around.”
 

 
Tong Zhao was assessing the three men in her mind.
 

 
[Wei Zekai clearly can’t do housework. He’s a useless layabout.]
 

 
[The top-notch guy should be saved for later. He’s a bit hard to figure out. I’ll handle the others first. Anyway, Han Zhi doesn’t seem the type to back off just because someone else is flirting.]
 

 
[Hmm, let’s start with the guy named He!]
 

 
The female sea king took the initiative, and the production team perked up, knowing there would be content to film.
 

 
What is the modern version of a queen’s flirtation like?
 

 
At the same time, the night fell.
 

 
After everyone clocked in and returned to their rooms:
 

 
When Wei Zekai got back to his room, he didn’t continue playing games. Instead, he took out a collar from his suitcase.
 

 
Though he was alone in the room, he nervously looked around to make sure no one else was present before putting on the collar: “Does it really have this magical function... damn!”
 

 
With a very cartoonish smoke effect, Wei Zekai disappeared.
 

 
In his place was a golden-brown dog.
 

 
[As a bold and unruly prodigy with the titles of "Judgment Officer" and "Rich Second Generation," you have an important task this time besides finding your beloved person—discover the hidden sea king among you and protect true love! To enhance your investigative abilities, you will have the power to transform for one hour each day.]
 

 
Wei Zekai: “...Woof!”
 

 
What’s the point of guarding someone else’s love?
 

 
But transforming into a dog is quite novel, so Wei Zekai decided to go for a walk.
 

 
The soft little paw pads made no sound as they stepped on the soft mat. The small Zekai quietly made its way downstairs, hearing some noise from the kitchen.
 

 
Hmm?
 

 
Could someone be sneaking a midnight snack?
 

 
Wei Zekai wagged its tail excitedly, curious about who might be so hungry.
 

 
However, as it entered the kitchen, the noise became clearer—it was the sound of a girl sobbing.
 

 
“Why did you have to leave me... couldn’t you stay with me a little longer? I thought many times about you leaving me, but I didn’t expect that when the day actually came... it’s so scary…”
 

 
The frantic and confused whispers, mixed with the suppressed crying, made the little Zekai’s tail bristle.
 

 
It peered around and saw an even more horrifying scene.
 

 
The usually subdued and gloomy Zhong Muxi was repeatedly cutting her wrist with a fruit knife.
 

 
In the place where her watch was removed, there were overlapping fresh and old wounds of varying depths.
 

 
The girl did not intend to end her life.
 

 
Through the pain, she seemed to gradually calm down. After washing the blood off the fruit knife, she regretfully rushed back to her room on the second floor.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who was experiencing being a dog for the first time, wanted to hide in shock.
 

 
Although his movements were slow, he stood in a blind spot due to his short legs and was not discovered.
 

 
So, this is how serious the harm from a breakup can be?
 

 
Wei Zekai was deeply shocked.
 

 
He thought about the other two men in the villa, one of whom might be the sea king and a scumbag...
 

 
The little dog shook its fur and wore a serious expression on its face.
 

 
At that moment, it felt a profound sense of mission.
# Chapter30
The camera pulls up, giving a bird's-eye view of the entire estate.
 

 
In the shot, each bedroom door gradually becomes transparent, revealing what each guest is doing.
 

 
The smart AI automatically identifies restricted and overly private scenes.
 

 
If a guest is changing clothes, that door will not become transparent, and even the production team cannot secretly peek.
 

 
...
 

 
He Shun is flipping through a book.
 

 
Zhong Muxi, who has returned to her room, is holding a first aid kit and iodine to treat her wound. She lets her tears slowly dry on her cheeks, her face showing numbness. This small first aid kit is something she brought in her luggage, and it’s clear that this self-harming behavior has been going on for some time. She is also quite accustomed to cleaning up the mess left on her body after an emotional breakdown.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian is lying on the bed playing with her phone, and the smart AI enlarges the screen of her phone.
 

 
"Prince Street No. 23"
 

 
"The Young Master's Rule"
 

 
"Sparrow Wants to Rise"
 

 
"No wonder she's so nice to Wei Zekai; turns out she likes prince-and-princess love stories," the young stagehand said.
 

 
Tong Zhao placed all the bottles and jars she had brought on the desk and was going through a complicated skincare routine. While she was applying body lotion to her calves, the director, with a bit of self-interest, had the camera linger on her for a moment, treating it as a fan-service shot for the audience.
 

 
The camera panned to the last bedroom—Han Zhi's room.
 

 
He was sitting at his desk, holding a sketchbook.
 

 
When drawing, Han Zhi wore glasses. The frameless, square glasses concealed the emotions in his passionate eyes, giving him a touch of cool abstinence and intellect. His pale, slender fingers held a pencil, and in no time, a gentle and simple face appeared on the paper.
 

 
The assistant director widened his eyes in surprise, "He actually likes Zhong Muxi?"
 

 
Who would have thought that the "sea king" would first set his sights on an unremarkable girl with glasses?
 

 
Not to mention Tong Zhao, who is stunningly beautiful, even Chang Xiaonian, who has a sweet and cute style, looks better than Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It's not polite to judge someone's appearance, but the entire production team was genuinely surprised.
 

 
The young stagehand made a sound, "Hmm. Some guys like him are like that. They go after plain, honest girls because they're easier to control... Think about it—if a handsome guy like Han Zhi confessed to you, wouldn't you feel particularly surprised, like you're unworthy? Even if you fought or argued in a relationship, you'd want to slap yourself for it."
 

 
As he spoke, Han Zhi gently tore out the completed sketch from his sketchbook and carefully placed it in the drawer.
 

 
Then, he began to draw on a new page.
 

 
Even if he is handsome, there's no point in continuously filming him just drawing, so the director was about to switch the camera when he noticed something unusual.
 

 
This time, Han Zhi was drawing a different face.
 

 
Lively, spirited round eyes and lips that always curve up into a sweet smile—the face of Chang Xiaonian, who the production team had just been discussing.
 

 
Production team: "..."
 

 
So, he's really just an expert at keeping things balanced?
 

 
After finishing, Han Zhi carefully tore out this sketch as well and put it away.
 

 
The assistant director, who had some experience with sketching from studying art, watched for a while and remarked, "Han Zhi is quite skilled at drawing. You can tell who it is, but he makes them look even better than in real life; he's very good at capturing the highlights."
 

 
Even Zhong Muxi, who was labeled as "ordinary" by the production team, appeared different under Han Zhi's pen. With her eyes lowered, he captured the graceful lines of her neck when she looked down. Only then did everyone realize that Zhong Muxi actually had a nice side profile, with a well-proportioned head and neck, looking fragile and delicate enough to evoke sympathy.
 

 
Han Zhi has a keen eye for discovering the good qualities in others.
 

 
If he could make someone so ordinary look so good, how stunning must Tong Zhao look under his pen?
 

 
The production team couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.
 

 
However, the previously inspired Han Zhi encountered difficulties when drawing the third sketch. Several times, he completed rough drafts only to tear them up and crumple them into a ball. After three repeated attempts, he finally drew a large, messy question mark over the oval face draft he had completed.
 

 
The small night lamp cast a warm glow on half of his face.
 

 
"I'm starting to think I'm filming an idol drama here. He doesn't need much directing at all—he's a man who naturally looks good on camera. Any random shot looks like a movie poster. If Tong Zhao were a man, she might achieve even more success!" the director said.
 

 
Leading roles for women in films are still a rarity.
 

 
You could say it's a blue ocean market, but no one wants to explore it; everyone thinks it's unprofitable. There are almost no actresses who can carry a box office hit—most of them just add a little extra appeal. However, actresses have their strengths: their "true selves" are more consistent and less likely to fall apart in their performances, even if they rarely shine.
 

 
While the production team drifted off-topic, Han Zhi put down his pencil, stuffed the sketchbook into the drawer, and furrowed his brows.
 

 
※
 

 
Early the next morning, Wei Zekai woke up very early.
 

 
He had a nightmare.
 

 
He dreamed that Zhong Muxi had slashed down with a knife, severing the major artery in her wrist, and blood kept gushing out, covering the floor. The fear from the morning shock still lingered. Being a young boy who gets hungry quickly, he habitually goes downstairs. Seeing the empty dining room, he remembered he wasn’t at home; no aunt woke up earlier than everyone to prepare breakfast, and a wave of sadness came over him.
 

 
He hadn’t been sad for long when he smelled the aroma of food.
 

 
Sniffing the air, he walked towards the kitchen and saw a tall, slender figure.
 

 
Han Zhi was cooking something delicious.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up, and at the same time, Han Zhi happened to turn around.
 

 
Han Zhi had no particular interest in cooking for another man, but when he saw the hungry young master staring at him with eyes practically turning green from hunger, he gave a gentle smile. “I’m a bit hungry. If you don’t mind, would you like to eat together?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn't have asked for anything better.
 

 
In the skillet, there was a pot of diced tomatoes, green and red peppers, onions, and bacon being stir-fried, with two sunny-side-up eggs cracked in. The wobbling egg yolks were incredibly appetizing, and the smell was irresistible. The rich tomato juice mixed with the egg yolk, perfectly paired with lightly toasted bread, awakened both the stomach and taste buds in the early morning. Han Zhi had also prepared a pot of plain porridge, blending Western and Eastern styles seamlessly.
 

 
Even Wei Zekai, who was used to eating all kinds of delicacies, was captivated by Han Zhi's cooking skills.
 

 
After hearing Wei Zekai's praise of him, Han Zhi was momentarily stunned and said, "This is just Shakshuka made with last night's leftover scraps, nothing extraordinary."
 

 
Here, a segment of Han Zhi's inner monologue was mixed in:
 

 
[The same goes for love.]
 

 
[When you've dated a lot and have all kinds of beauties at your fingertips, your pursuit begins to diversify. There isn’t a girl who isn't worthy of my love. If other men think a girl is ordinary, it's because they lack the ability to polish a rough diamond or uncover a hidden treasure. That's their incompetence, not the girl's fault.]
 

 
Assistant Director: "Damn, he’s so poetic in his player ways."
 

 
The scriptwriter joked, "How about we cut this part and let me steal it for my novel?"
 

 
The young stagehand was puzzled: "Is that being a player? I think what he said sounds quite pleasant. If this is what being a player is like, I'd like to be played by him!"
 

 
The production team debated endlessly about whether Han Zhi's mindset was considered "playing" or not, until the props team, staying true to their focus, gently reminded them, "Wake up, everyone. He's just a subconscious manifestation split from Tong Zhao; this man doesn’t actually exist in reality."
 

 
The statement jolted everyone to their senses.
 

 
The assistant director, however, came up with a new idea: "Hey, how about we reveal Han Zhi’s true identity only after this season airs?"
 

 
"Good idea! Since Han Zhi has managed to charm the women in our team so thoroughly... Forget about his charisma, just look at that face—who wouldn't love it? Is this really extracted from Tong Zhao's memory? She’s got quite the imagination!"
 

 
"Then, we could create a trending topic like #DemandHanZhiToDebut and build up some hype, followed by a plot twist later. That would definitely make a splash!"
 

 
...
 

 
Amidst their discussions, the rest of the people gradually woke up.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi came to an agreement and cooked a pot of noodles to share, deliberately not making any for Tong Zhao and He Shun.
 

 
After eating their fill, the two girls curled up on the sofa, whispering while watching TV, gossiping about how Tong Zhao was a “green tea bitch.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi hesitated a bit, "She didn’t really do anything, right…?"
 

 
"Women understand women best!" Chang Xiaonian declared confidently. "I knew it last night during dinner. She didn’t even look at us and only responded to the guys. It was super obvious. I just don’t know which one she’s targeting. Hopefully, she’ll leave Wei Zekai alone. I think Teacher He would suit her better; he kept staring at her."
 

 
"That He teacher is pretty annoying too. Calling him 'teacher' is already giving him too much credit. You can tell he’s got a 'straight man cancer' mentality—probably the kind who would dump all the household chores on his wife after marriage and treat her like a nanny. Asking him to step into the kitchen is like asking him to sacrifice himself."
 

 
Zhong Muxi nodded silently.
 

 
She wasn’t interested in finding a partner in this event, so she didn’t care who Tong Zhao tried to flirt with. However, Chang Xiaonian was her only female friend in this unfamiliar environment, so she wouldn’t contradict her friend just for Tong Zhao.
 

 
But just as Zhong Muxi nodded, she heard the sound of the sofa sinking down beside her.
 

 
The two were startled and looked toward the source of the sound, only to find that the very person they had been talking about—Tong Zhao—was sitting on the single-seater sofa sipping a yogurt. Her fair and delicate face was adorned with a subtle “no-makeup” makeup look, and her almond-shaped eyes cast a casual, teasing glance in their direction.
 

 
[Did she hear what we were just saying?]
 

 
[Whatever, so what if she did hear? We’re not friends anyway; saying a few bad things behind someone’s back is pretty normal!]
 

 
This was Chang Xiaonian’s inner monologue.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also worried that Tong Zhao had overheard them, so she looked down and pretended to be playing on her phone.
 

 
In this reality show focused on natural interactions, storylines of girls scheming against each other were also very popular with viewers, so the AI instantly captured Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts.
 

 
Tong Zhao had indeed heard everything.
 

 
She thought that what Chang Xiaonian said made a lot of sense.
 

 
Concubine Chen wasn't interested in women at all and didn't care about their opinions of her.
 

 
"I totally didn't notice you come over. How do you walk so quietly?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian awkwardly tried to start a conversation.
 

 
Tong Zhao swung her well-proportioned legs and chuckled, "Maybe it's because I'm too light. Oh well, I'll just have to try harder to gain some weight."
 

 
The ordinary girls who gain weight no matter how much they eat: "..."
 

 
Without any men around, the "Concubine" wasn't pretending to be innocent at all.
 

 
At this moment, she resembled a flamboyant carnivorous flower; every glance and smile seemed to flaunt her beauty.
 

 
After speaking, Tong Zhao patted her flat stomach. "Talking about gaining weight makes me hungry. I'll go ask Teacher He to make me something to eat."
 

 
?
 

 
Do you not have hands of your own?
 

 
Question marks popped up in the heads of the two girls.
 

 
After a while, Chang Xiaonian saw He Shun—whom she had labeled as someone who would absolutely never do housework—enter the kitchen with a "can't say no to you" smile and make Tong Zhao a bowl of fried sauce noodles. After she happily finished eating, he even took the initiative to wash the bowl.
 

 
What’s going on?
 

 
Where did your macho attitude go?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was shocked to her core.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was also a bit surprised.
 

 
Teacher He resembled her ex-boyfriend a lot, so when Xiaonian bluntly said that He Shun would never do housework, she agreed wholeheartedly. However, seeing this scene made her somewhat confused.
# Chapter31
"I can’t figure it out."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stole a glance at Tong Zhao, who was happily eating fruit at the long dining table. "It seems like that woman really has her eyes on Teacher He, but... she hasn’t done anything at all. Why is Mr. He being so attentive to her?"
 

 
"I don’t know either."
 

 
Zhong Muxi looked down, hiding the envy in her eyes.
 

 
He Shun’s "straight man cancer" was quite evident, and he also showed signs of looking down on women.
 

 
Just like her ex-boyfriend.
 

 
Of course, her ex had many advantages—he was a prominent figure in school, came from a well-off family, and had a smooth career path after graduation. If she hadn’t pursued him in college, she might never have encountered such an outstanding man in the workplace.
 

 
Back then, Zhong Muxi did all the laundry and cooking for her boyfriend, delivering freshly washed fruit to his dorm, and baking handmade cookies and various snacks. Because he had expressed a desire for a virtuous partner, she strived to fit the mold of his ideal companion, believing that meeting the “CHD Girlfriend Requirements” would secure the bright future he had envisioned.
 

 
Zhong Muxi had far exceeded those expectations.
 

 
She didn’t want her boyfriend to worry, so after starting work and moving in together, she took on all the household chores.
 

 
She didn’t dare to stay late at work to improve her performance because she needed to get home earlier than her boyfriend so that he could have hot meals when he arrived after working overtime.
 

 
But all she received in return was increasing impatience.
 

 
Her boyfriend told her to improve herself, but after work, she was too exhausted from cooking and doing housework to have time for the gym. He paid the rent and utilities but never cared about the cost of groceries, yet he would give her the cold shoulder if there was no meat or seafood on the table, putting down his chopsticks after only a few bites.
 

 
Eventually, because she was too ordinary and unambitious, her boyfriend ended their relationship amicably.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t want an amicable breakup, but she couldn’t learn how to cry, argue, or fight.
 

 
So in the end, all her destructive impulses and hatred, like the utility knife in her hand, turned inward, with the blade pointing at herself.
 

 
She lifted her eyes to look at Tong Zhao, who had finished eating and pushed the bowl towards He Shun. Her eyes, behind her glasses, were filled with complex longing.
 

 
After everyone had their fill, the large screen TV in the living room lit up with colorful images.
 

 
The variety show had a main storyline driving the guests’ actions to increase viewer interest.
 

 
In the show, guests had to complete mandatory tasks, which varied randomly. Completing them would yield corresponding random rewards, while failure meant facing penalties.
 

 
Everyone turned their gaze to the giant screen.
 

 
"Love won't come just by sitting around. Now, the official provides you with an opportunity to get familiar with each other. Please choose one and head to the game room!"
 

 
"1: Werewolf"
 

 
"2: Truth or Dare"
 

 
"3: King's Game"
 

 
"Isn't it better to quickly get acquainted by playing Honor of Kings together?" Wei Zekai was unimpressed by the official game options. The first two seemed too old-fashioned, and the third was something he had only heard of in nightclubs and bars, not a serious game.
 

 
Han Zhi said they should follow everyone's preference.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t mind.
 

 
He Shun naturally took over the decision-making and chose Truth or Dare.
 

 
His internal monologue at this moment also had a personal touch: [Werewolf... this kind of brain-intensive game is no fun when half the participants are women; they think too emotionally. The King's Game is a bit vulgar, so Truth or Dare is a better choice.]
 

 
The stage crew girl said, "I really want to hit him. What should I do?"
 

 
Other female staff members echoed her sentiments.
 

 
---
 

 
The game room was very spacious, equipped with both popular and rare board games.
 

 
As everyone walked into the room, a board labeled “Truth or Dare” was quietly placed on a round table, with chairs around it marked with their names, suggesting they should sit in an alternating gender arrangement.
 

 
Tong Zhao sat between Wei Zekai and Han Zhi.
 

 
He Shun glanced towards her and hesitated before suggesting he wanted to switch seats.
 

 
“Han Zhi…”
 

 
He had just begun to speak when Han Zhi’s piercing gaze made him feel as if his thoughts were being clearly seen through a high-powered lens. He Shun instinctively felt a bit unnerved and instead asked Wei Zekai, who, although tall, was clearly more of a big boy than a man, “Can I switch seats with you?”
 

 
Wei Zekai didn’t really care where he sat.
 

 
What difference did it make where he sat to play a game?
 

 
Just as he was about to impatiently agree, Wei Zekai suddenly recalled the unsettling scene in the kitchen last night and the heavy responsibility he had—he wasn’t here just to play; finding a partner was secondary. His main goal was to identify the "sea king" among these people.
 

 
He Shun, who seemed to have an inexplicable reason to switch seats, was highly suspicious!
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaze suddenly became sharp.
 

 
“Why do you want to switch seats with me?” Wei Zekai asked, his tone unfriendly.
 

 
However, Wei Zekai's arrogant and overbearing demeanor didn't raise He Shun's suspicions. He simply muttered inwardly about the wealthy but uncultured young master.
 

 
"I’m more familiar with Zhao Zhao and can take better care of her," He Shun said.
 

 
He was speaking the truth.
 

 
Tong Zhao was very poor at taking care of herself.
 

 
She almost burned her hand while boiling water to cook noodles (actually, she hadn't even touched the boiling water; she was just pretending to protect her delicate fingers). She had never washed a dish at home and was a little princess raised under strict care from her family (according to her own story). Although He Shun's mother treated him like a prince, he still had basic life knowledge, but it depended on whether he wanted to apply it.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao had never done it, it was only right for him to handle it.
 

 
Moreover, seeing the adoring and dependent look in the young girl's eyes, He Shun couldn't resist and quickly became her tool.
 

 
"Do we really need to take care of each other while playing a game?" Hearing this poor excuse, Wei Zekai’s gaze became even sharper. Although their conversation was quiet, it gradually drew the attention of others. He Shun, feeling embarrassed, said, “Forget it, it’s nothing.” He then returned to his original seat.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who was seated next to He Shun as arranged by the production team, clearly heard everything, and her previous delight at sitting next to Wei Zekai had vanished.
 

 
What’s up with this He guy?
 

 
Is it really such a burden for him to sit next to a girl?
 

 
Does Tong Zhao really need all that special care? Is she like a modern-day princess with her older knight?
 

 
Han Zhi picked up the "Truth or Dare" cards and began shuffling. He held the cards with three fingers, smoothly fanned them with his thumb, first displaying them and then pressing and flipping them in a fluid, pleasing manner.
 

 
Han Zhi said, “The rules are simple: you can’t choose 'Truth' or 'Dare' consecutively.”
 

 
The game room also had a large screen.
 

 
A mechanical synthesized voice explained the rules: “For those who choose 'Dare,' the task will be randomly selected by the official and shown on the screen. For 'Truth,' the player who draws the smallest numbered card will decide whether to answer their own question or one selected by the screen. If a player lies during 'Truth,' the lie detector here will sound.”
 

 
“Questions that are prohibited include:
 

 
- Restricted or offensive questions.
 
- Questions about the identity cards drawn by others.
 
- Players can choose to refuse to answer and directly accept a punishment task.”
 

 
It sounded like choosing 'Truth' was relatively easier.
 

 
In the first round, Han Zhi drew the ghost card.
 

 
"It seems like I'm having bad luck today," Han Zhi said helplessly, shaking the ghost card in his hand. "I'll go with 'Truth.'"
 

 
The player who drew the smallest number card was Wei Zekai.
 

 
What should he ask?
 

 
Wei Zekai had a sudden idea, realizing this was a great opportunity to probe—although he couldn’t directly ask if the person was a playboy, he could indirectly gather the truth and infer the result. The truth was singular, and at this moment, he was like Detective Conan’s grandfather!
 

 
After a moment of contemplation, he cautiously asked, “Could you elaborate on your views on relationships?”
 

 
In Wei Zekai’s limited understanding of emotional intelligence, a playboy was necessarily detestable and had a distorted worldview.
 

 
...
 

 
From Han Zhi's perspective, which was unaffected by any identity card, romantic relationships were not within his realm of consideration.
 

 
As a top celebrity carrying the dreams of countless young girls, if he fell in love with someone, it would shatter the dreams of those girls. Before joining the reality show, Tong Zhao thought that his lack of romantic experience made him suitable for the task because...
 

 
He was very skilled at making others fall in love with him.
 

 
Of course, after entering the show, Han Zhi's mind had been filled with a large number of “exes” that matched his views on relationships.
 

 
Wei Zekai's expression was intense and probing when he asked, not like he was playing a game.
 

 
He was very serious in his mind.
 

 
And this was also the reason why, in his past life, Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao grew further apart. Wei Zekai, who had no concept of being smooth or diplomatic, interacted with people in a very raw manner. He could turn good intentions into something annoying and bothersome. If he weren't so good-looking, he would indeed be more suited to play a comic villain in a comedy.
 

 
“Well,”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him with surprise, seemingly not expecting a man to be interested in his views on relationships.
 

 
His aesthetic preferences were only for women, but if Wei Zekai was dressed as a girl...
 

 
He imagined it in his mind and thought, it might not be so bad.
 

 
This image was vividly captured by the AI, comparable to the fantasy of Snape in a dress from the wizarding world.
 

 
The director immediately decided to include this scene in the highlight preview.
 

 
Han Zhi briefly pondered, then his lips and eyes curved into a gentle smile. Even such a playful question from a rich, rebellious young man was taken seriously by him. Everyone heard him say: “It should be about bringing happiness to those who like me. I would want her to know that in my eyes, she is unique and shining.”
 

 
He had a deep, mellow voice.
 

 
Even though he was speaking very normal things and not affecting his tone, his words seemed to penetrate the eardrums, causing a tingling sensation. The other two female guests couldn't help but have their hearts race and faces flush.
 

 
It’s not scary if a playboy is handsome; it’s frightening if a playboy is also a warm-hearted man.
 

 
Only Tong Zhao raised her hand and scratched her ear, giving him a very harsh label:
 

 
"Pure desire has become a demon, this is something else."
 

 
Tong Zhao immediately knew he was downplaying the issue.
 

 
The lie detector didn’t go off, most likely because he truly thought that way.
 

 
She had a keen eye for people, and Han Zhi was definitely not superficial.
 

 
But others didn’t see it that way.
 

 
Especially Wei Zekai—
 

 
He was moved!
 

 
How could someone with such pure thoughts possibly be a playboy?
 

 
Even if he drew the special identity card of a playboy, he surely wouldn’t harm girls!
 

 
Detective Wei Zekai first ruled out one correct answer and categorized Han Zhi into the safe group in his mind.
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed sarcastically in her mind, not expecting that in the next round she would draw "Dare."
 

 
"Dare: Please have the 'Ghost King' and the person who drew the smallest number come to Room 2 at 8 PM tonight and mold a pair of ceramic couple cups."
 

 
He Shun immediately looked at his card.
 

 
Unfortunately, he drew a rather large number, so he had little hope.
 

 
"Ah."
 

 
The old enchantress sitting next to Tong Zhao, who was both pure and seductive, gently shook her square two cards.
# Chapter32
In the second round, Zhong Muxi drew the "Ghost" card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, who drew the smallest card, didn't make things difficult for her; she just asked what Zhong Muxi's favorite food was. Zhong Muxi quietly answered "Cake," and the game continued. Compared to the handsome men and beautiful women present, no one seemed to care about her answer. It was as if, in school, she was just one of those ordinary students whom no one paid much attention to, neither bullied nor interested in.
 

 
As she spoke, Zhong Muxi's gaze was lowered.
 

 
This caused her to miss the fact that Han Zhi had been intently watching her throughout her answer.
 

 
In the next round, Wei Zekai, who drew another "Dare," had to cook a meal with Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Both of them were clueless about cooking and were instantly at a loss, while Chang Xiaonian was somewhat pleased.
 

 
These little details about the girls were fully revealed on camera.
 

 
In the third round, He Shun, who drew the "Ghost King" card, chose "Truth." Zhong Muxi impulsively asked him, "What type of girl do you like?"
 

 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.
 

 
"Probably a gentle and virtuous girl, someone more homey. I place a lot of importance on family warmth.”
 

 
He Shun was also a bit surprised but answered the straightforward question honestly.
 

 
【So this glasses-wearing girl has an interest in me too?】 He Shun's inner voice held a trace of condescension.
 

 
Zhong Muxi glanced at the lie detector and quickly looked down.
 

 
Her hands clenched tightly under the table.
 

 
Zhong Muxi's inner thoughts were on the verge of breaking down: 【How could there be no lie? Am I not gentle or virtuous enough? Tong Zhao can't cook or wash dishes! Why lie? Why?】
 

 
……
 

 
The lighting technician was surprised: "Were Zhong Muxi and He Shun in a relationship before?"
 

 
"No, they didn’t know each other before joining the reality show. Zhong Muxi doesn't have any feelings for He Shun," the director said, showing the detected affection level. Zhong Muxi's affection for He Shun was only 30, which fell into the category of "feeling uncomfortable being alone with him in an elevator."
 

 
The scriptwriter sympathetically looked at the glasses-wearing girl on the observation screen: "Didn’t Zhong Muxi think that He Shun resembled her ex-boyfriend? Maybe she projected the same doubts. Why, even though He Shun says he likes gentle and virtuous girls, he end up showing affection to a princess-type girl who doesn't know anything?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi drew the dare card again, and her task was to watch a romantic movie with Han Zhi.
 

 
In the final round, Tong Zhao drew the ghost card.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian asked her how many boyfriends she had had, with a hint of curiosity and mild jealousy in her probing.
 

 
In this reality show, Tong Zhao’s identity card indicated that she had no romantic experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao's eyes curved slightly, and a genuine smile spread across her lips.
 

 
"None."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who also had no romantic experience, looked at her with a look of approval, noting that she should be protected.
 

 
The burden on the judge's shoulders was indeed heavy.
 

 
*
 

 
The screen in the game room announced that the task was successfully completed.
 

 
Today's reward was that all players would receive a day's worth of ingredients.
 

 
Since it was only the second day, everyone was still not very familiar with each other. The two young girls stuck together like conjoined twins, while He Shun and Tong Zhao carried out the task on their identity cards—He Shun was the "teacher" and had to tutor Tong Zhao, who drew the "female student" card. Over the course of a month, there would be three tests, and failure to pass would result in penalties for both.
 

 
Although there was a study room in the estate, Tong Zhao requested to have the classes at the long table in the living room, citing He Shun’s gender as the reason.
 

 
He Shun agreed, showing no outward dissatisfaction, but felt a bit regretful inside.
 

 
The production team observed that his favorability towards Tong Zhao had increased, reaching the threshold of “not believing others' negative comments about her.”
 

 
“One moment he’s all over the place,” one female staff member said, puzzled, “He Shun wanted to be alone with Tong Zhao, but she didn’t give him that chance. He feels regretful, yet his favorability increased? Can someone explain this from a man’s perspective?”
 

 
A male screenwriter tried to relate and found he felt the same way: “Men often take advantage of any chance they get. It feels good to benefit from a girl, but they will only really like a girl who values herself and has principles… Plus, when the chance to be alone does come, it feels even more rewarding! If it were me, I’d start looking forward to the opportunity to be alone with Tong Zhao from this moment on, and would be very willing to go out of my way to win her approval.”
 

 
The lighting technician said, “Thanks, that made me feel a bit cheapened.”
 

 
Wei Zekai and Han Zhi were left alone.
 

 
Han Zhi was reading in the room, while Wei Zekai, who had been playing video games on the sofa, dozed off with his head tilted, setting an alarm for the night before he fell asleep.
 

 
After all, he had drawn the "Dare" card and had to cook dinner with Miss Chang.
 

 
Wei Zekai was quite troubled.
 

 
His peak cooking skills in this lifetime were during the heyday of games like Cooking Mama and Kitchen Nightmares. His culinary prowess in the games was impressive, but in reality, he was rather clueless.
 

 
Fortunately, Tong Zhao and Han Zhi were in the same group; they were both quite straightforward, so he could relax.
 

 
Otherwise, he would really be in a bind.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was also very worried.
 

 
She thought about it and decided to consult Han Zhi, who was known for his excellent cooking. He carefully taught her two quick dishes and was even more easygoing than she had expected.
 

 
However, by the evening, Chang Xiaonian’s worries came true.
 

 
She asked Wei Zekai to assist her. He was quite obedient, rolling up his sleeves without a word and getting to work. While she handled other ingredients, she turned around to find that he had turned the onions into onion paste.
 

 
“……”
 

 
Wei Zekai's handsome eyebrows were filled with pride. “My knife skills are pretty good, right? Who wouldn’t say that’s impressive?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian opened her mouth and then, with restraint, closed it.
 

 
“I’ll handle this. You go help me cook the rice,” she instructed gently.
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just tested his knife skills, found cooking somewhat interesting. He thought that such a simple task seemed beneath his talents, but given that it was a request from a girl, he decided to go to the rice cooker after washing the rice.
 

 
Wei Zekai carefully rinsed the rice.
 

 
Seeing his reliable actions, Chang Xiaonian felt a bit reassured.
 

 
When she finished preparing the dishes and went to serve the rice, she opened the lid and saw a pot of...
 

 
Stir-fried rice.
 

 
The grains were distinct, and the rice was stuck together, occasionally forming clumps, resembling cat litter.
 

 
……
 

 
“Wei Zekai,” Chang Xiaonian exclaimed in shock, “Did you cook the rice without adding water!?”
 

 
What kind of mistake is this?
 

 
Wei Zekai was even more shocked. “You have to add water when cooking rice!?”
 

 
With no other option, Chang Xiaonian had to add water and cook it again.
 

 
The rice that came out of this second cooking was wet on the outside but hard on the inside, with a very poor texture. When Wei Zekai took the first bite, he almost spit it out but managed to swallow it only because it was his own work. The others looked at Han Zhi with a hint of longing for the meals he prepared but didn’t say anything.
 

 
Tong Zhao took two bites and then put down her bowl.
 

 
The AI captured her thoughts:
 

 
[Just because there’s rice in the bowl doesn’t mean it can be called rice. This bowl should be called carbohydrates at most.]
 

 
“I’ll meet you in the pottery room at eight. I’m going to take a walk to digest,” she said, glancing down at her bowl and chopsticks with a troubled expression. Han Shun immediately offered, “Go ahead, I’ve eaten enough. I’ll wash your dishes for you.”
 

 
Such a casual offer.
 

 
To Chang Xiaonian, Han Shun had already become a complete “simp.” She couldn’t help but feel a bit of sympathy for the gentle and handsome guy who would be alone with Tong Zhao to do pottery later.
 

 
I hope that after coming out of the pottery room, there won’t be another "simp" in the manor.
 

 
But it doesn’t really matter now.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was feeling quite distressed.
 

 
She had no romantic experience, loved reading novels, and read many Taiwanese pocketbooks during school that featured stories about campus princes falling in love. After starting work, she read a lot of stories about perfect relatives slapping faces and green tea bitches, learning about human relationships from novels, with no real-life opportunity to interact with a big shot.
 

 
She joined this activity with high hopes and felt that Wei Zekai was just like the campus prince she had imagined when she arrived at the manor.
 

 
Although he had a poor attitude, was absorbed in playing games, and seemed disinterested in women, he was rich and handsome. Wasn’t he the perfect leading man?
 

 
Unexpectedly, when she finally got a chance to be alone with him, she found out—
 

 
How could this guy be so clueless?
 

 
Wasn’t a prince supposed to excel at everything effortlessly?
 

 
And it was just cooking rice!
 

 
Miss Chang looked resentfully at the sofa, only to find that the previously lounging Wei Zekai was nowhere to be seen.
 

 
---
 

 
At exactly eight o'clock, Tong Zhao pushed open the door to the pottery studio.
 

 
The walls of the studio were decorated with rows of hanging ceramic artworks. The table was equipped with a full set of pottery tools, and the pottery wheel was small and delicate. Han Zhi was already seated, glancing over at her with evident anticipation. The bright light in the room and his gaze created a relaxing and comforting atmosphere.
 

 
He was the kind of man who made it easy to let down one's guard.
 

 
"Have you been here long?" she asked.
 

 
"Just arrived," he said. "I wanted to see if there were any tutorials. I’ve already learned a bit of the basics," Han Zhi arranged the tools neatly like little soldiers and motioned for her to sit beside him. "It’s a bit challenging, but it’s quite fun, like playing with mud..."
 

 
As he spoke, he chuckled, "Because it is like playing with mud."
 

 
Preparing for a date in advance was already a step ahead of many other men.
 

 
What was even more impressive was how natural he made it seem, not treating it as an achievement to boast about but as a thoughtful gesture subtly integrated into the experience.
 

 
Tong Zhao took a seat beside him and then noticed him magically pull out a thermal box from beside the stool and push it in front of her. Inside the box was a sandwich with egg salad. "I made some extra for myself after dinner, and since you didn’t seem to have a good meal, I made a bit more. If you don’t mind, you can have some to fill your stomach.”
 

 
---
 

 
"Thank you. I really didn’t eat well; that meal was hard to describe."
 

 
She complained in a spoiled tone, like a young lady who felt entitled.
 

 
Tong Zhao picked up the sandwich and began to eat. The white toast was lightly toasted and still warm, likely made not long before.
 

 
While she ate, Han Zhi looked away and drew a cute chibi bunny in his sketchbook.
 

 
Tong Zhao, curious, asked, "Can you draw?"
 

 
"I was just looking at a tutorial that said pottery doesn't have to be about making cups; you can also make figurines. The coloring tools here are quite complete," Han Zhi said with a smile. "I didn’t know what to make at first, but when I saw you eating, I thought of making a bunny."
 

 
Tong Zhao, munching on her sandwich, paused and asked, "Do I look like a bunny?"
 

 
Han Zhi, though young and dressed neatly, had an inexplicable air of weariness about him, as if he had experienced many things and returned with a calm and gentle demeanor. It felt like if you threw a tantrum in front of him, you would only receive a tolerant look.
 

 
Such a man would be classified as an “older man” in books targeted at middle school students—
 

 
---
 

 
In romance novels, the male lead is often considered youthful, and by the age of twenty-eight, he's already called "uncle," akin to a twenty-three-year-old eSports veteran.
 

 
Upon hearing this, Han Zhi, for the first time since Tong Zhao entered, stared at her intently.
 

 
Though he only maintained his gaze for about five seconds before looking away.
 

 
"It shouldn’t be like that; I just suddenly thought of it."
 

 
---
 

 
This was different from the initial expectations of the show’s crew regarding the "player" scenario.
 

 
Han Zhi, holding the "Writer" identity card, didn’t say any elaborate romantic lines to her. Even now, he didn't climb the ladder to praise her for being as cute as a bunny.
 

 
The production assistant pondered, "Even if Han Zhi is a top-notch handsome guy, pretending to genuinely praise a girl he just met as being like a little bunny… that’s pretty cringy! I’d rather he stayed silent and be a mute handsome guy!"
 

 
The men in the crew didn't understand.
 

 
Women’s definitions of what is cringy are indeed hard to grasp.
 

 
Yet, Han Zhi managed to control that line perfectly.
 

 
After Tong Zhao finished the sandwich, the large screen in the ceramics studio displayed the task requirements for completing the adventure: “Create three beginner-level ceramic pieces, one of which must be a joint effort.”
 

 
Han Zhi interpreted it: “So, we each make one ceramic figure, and then we collaborate on one to complete the task.”
 

 
“That’s about the idea.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took a tissue to wipe her hands and began to sculpt a ceramic figure under Han Zhi’s guidance.
 

 
Though Han Zhi claimed to only know a little, his actual handling of the task was like that of a teacher.
 

 
He could answer any questions Tong Zhao had immediately.
 

 
He was extremely skilled.
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him skeptically: “Is this really your first time doing ceramics?”
 

 
“Mm.”
 

 
Han Zhi answered, and just as Tong Zhao thought he would keep up the pretense, he suddenly revealed a refined and subtle smile: “This kind of thing… At the beginning, when you bring a girl along, it might seem like you’re trying to hold her hand, which is too obvious. By the time the relationship progresses to that stage, it becomes cliché.”
 

 
His deep voice echoed in the quiet ceramics studio, like a sudden thunderclap.
 

 
Tong Zhao's breath caught slightly, and her heartbeat quickened.
 

 
She pondered: *Is he revealing his true self so quickly?*
 

 
Normal romantic interactions often develop gradually, and the excitement comes from less experience.
 

 
Even holding hands can make someone anxious throughout an entire movie.
 

 
For an experienced person, holding hands and whispering during a movie is quite natural. It’s either enjoyed together or, for a novice, a nervous attempt at routines they’ve seen done many times before. Excitement has a threshold, similar to how readers felt about time-travel novels when they first became popular. Authors could spend an entire chapter discussing life before the time travel and the reasons behind it, as there was still novelty.
 

 
Later on?
 

 
With ten, a hundred, or even thousands of time-travel and reverse time-travel novels…
 

 
The result is that readers become numb. Numbness aside, they still read. Just as with a sea king’s romantic embraces, even if many have experienced similar things, it doesn’t stop the action—it just isn’t as exciting anymore.
 

 
So, skip the guessing phase and get straight to the point.
 

 
To evoke romantic feelings in front of an experienced person, one must rely on surprise—
 

 
Han Zhi initiated the advance.
 

 
“So if you wanted to hold her hand, how would you do it?”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t look at him, seemingly focused and interested as she molded the clay in her hands.
 

 
But she felt his gaze on her hands.
 

 
Her delicate, fair hands looked like snow against the clay.
 

 
“If you want to shape it like an ear, you’re doing it wrong,”
 

 
Han Zhi leaned closer, his lips near her ear. He reached out to correct the clay doll’s ear, his large, defined hand close to hers but deliberately avoiding direct contact.
 

 
He smiled and asked, “I’m also struggling with this issue. How about you teach me?”
 

 
His deep voice carried a hint of laughter, with a languid undertone of unspoken desire.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but lift her eyes to glance at him, as if she had misheard his leading question. Under the bright lights, his demeanor was calm and composed, yet an ambiguous tension lingered between them, a distance close enough that one could easily pull the other into an embrace.
 

 
First, she steered the conversation back to a more serious topic, and once the distance was closed, she maintained a serious demeanor.
 

 
As she began to imagine, he provided further subtle cues for continued flirtation…
 

 
In terms of pure desire, Han Zhi was indeed a master.
 

 
What was he troubled by?
 

 
Whether it was about how to hold a girl’s hand or how to mold clay?
 

 
Tong Zhao, stirred by his teasing, took his hand in hers.
 

 
“Do I really need to teach you this too?”
 

 
She looked up at him, her pale eyes filled with irritation from being teased, making her look particularly fierce—different types of men have corresponding strategies, and in Tong Zhao’s eyes, both Han and the current flirt were in need of discipline and correction. The difference was that pretending to be innocent with Han Zhi was useless; a harsh approach was needed for a seasoned flirt.
 

 
Tong Zhao curled her lips into a cold smile and spoke in a soft, seductive tone, “Zhi-ge.”
 

 
These two words seemed to have magic. After she spoke them, both "sea kings" were momentarily stunned.
 

 
He felt that this term of address seemed strangely familiar…
 

 
In a moment of relaxation from Han Zhi, Tong Zhao took the opportunity to assert herself. She smeared the clay-covered hand across his exquisitely handsome face and teased, “The only thing about me that resembles a rabbit is that I’m particularly capable. Aren’t you curious to try it?”
 

 
As soon as she said this, she pulled back, clearly indicating she was just teasing and ready to leave.
 

 
Han Zhi quickly reacted and grabbed her wrist to hold her in place.
 

 
Facing Tong Zhao's fierce gaze, Han Zhi’s heart raced even faster than before—
 

 
He wasn’t mistaken; Tong Zhao was indeed not the innocent, delicate flower she appeared to be. Her true nature was that of a domineering, arrogant beauty, and her inherent beauty carried a strong aggressive force when revealed.
 

 
This was also related to the era’s background.
 

 
In the feudal era, the Imperial Concubine Chen was like a red silk sleeve tied around the emperor’s neck—a kind of dominance that was still soft and charming. The emperor’s emotions were under her control. Without the emperor's authority to suppress her, the Imperial Concubine Chen’s imposing presence felt as though she might stomp on his face with her high heels at any moment.
 

 
Han Zhi’s gaze lingered on her rosy lips, his heart stirred deeply.
 

 
“Why? Not letting go?”
 

 
Tong Zhao squinted, ready to turn hostile at any moment.
 

 
“Not really willing to let go.”
 

 
Han Zhi admitted candidly, and in the next instant, he decided on his strategy. His poetic features took on a vulnerable expression, his aura softening to appear harmless, like a gentle teacher. Before releasing her wrist, he leaned in and brushed his face against the small patch of skin she had smeared with clay.
 

 
Then, he let go of her hand.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s pupils widened slightly in surprise. The unexpected touch had startled her, but her agitation calmed down… She tilted her head, using the back of her hand to wipe the clay off her cheek while scrutinizing Han Zhi.
 

 
He still looked obedient.
 

 
Just moments ago, they had almost crossed a line.
 

 
From boiling to cooling down, it only took a thought.
 

 
After a brief pause, she curved her lips into a playful smile and complimented him, “Quick reaction—knows that I’m more responsive to gentleness than to force.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback by the praise, revealing a hesitant expression as if he had hit a sensitive spot.
 

 
“Don’t,”
 

 
Han Zhi’s eyes crinkled with a spring-like smile, “I can be quite assertive too.”
 

 
“Forget it,” Tong Zhao sneered, diving back into her pottery project with much more force, making it seem like she was trying to crush the fox doll’s head: “Do you think I’m like Chang Xiaonian? Someone who likes domineering CEOs?”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t respond.
 

 
He wouldn’t criticize another girl in front of Tong Zhao.
 

 
“I get irritated when I see men showing off in front of me. Damn it, I can’t stand pretentious people,” Tong Zhao roughly shaped a crude fox doll. Her craftsmanship had always been average; previously, the pouches she made for the emperor were all done by palace maids. She was more like a project manager. After finishing the doll, she added, “Oh, except for myself.”
 

 
Han Zhi listened quietly while finishing his own piece.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at his wheel and noticed a bunny doll with a puffed-out face, much more delicate and beautiful than hers. She raised an eyebrow, “Is this how you see me?”
 

 
“Temporarily, yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi met her gaze calmly, not planning to back down this time.
 

 
[I’ve realized, this is a particularly difficult woman.]
 

 
[Being too domineering and tough won’t work; she’ll turn hostile. Acting meek and weak will just get her to look down on you. Objectively, apart from her top-notch beauty, she has many annoying personality traits. In front of someone like He Shun, she still has the interest to put on a show, but it won’t last long. Once the other person falls deeply in love with her, her true nature will be revealed.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed with a detached mindset.
 

 
---
 

 
In the production team:
 

 
The lighting technician clicked his tongue in amazement: “From Han Zhi’s inner monologue, it looks like he and Tong Zhao have no chemistry at all?”
 

 
The scriptwriter gave him a look: “It’s obvious he hasn’t been in a relationship. The sexual tension between them is so strong that I suspect if it weren’t for the restriction on explicit content... but then again, considering Han Zhi’s true identity, it’s a bit complicated.”
 

 
---
 

 
[Cynical, domineering, capricious, self-important...]
 

 
[If we were to sketch her personality, Tong Zhao would certainly be full of flaws.]
 

 
Han Zhi thought, giving her a provocative smile: “If you don’t want to be a prickly little bunny, then show me your other strengths.”
 

 
Tong Zhao looked at him with curiosity, thinking he was a master of adaptation, and quite a cunning old fox.
 

 
[Let me see what other tricks you have—]
 

 
With this passionate thought, she grabbed his arm and pulled him towards her, kissing his lips forcefully.
 

 
Tong Zhao's actions were so intense that they knocked over the recently made ceramic figures.
 

 
The ugly fox was pinned down by the aggressive rabbit on the table and couldn't get up.
# Chapter33
"Congratulations to both of you for completing the adventure task!"
 

 
After these words appeared on the electronic screen in the ceramic studio, they heard two beeps, and the previously locked door automatically opened. Tong Zhao placed the two ceramic figures on the shelf, deliberately keeping them far apart from Han Zhi's work—
 

 
It’s not about not knowing the goods, but fearing the comparison.
 

 
Even someone as proud as Tong Zhao had to admit that her ceramic fox was poorly made.
 

 
Han Zhi asked, "Why place them so far apart?"
 

 
"Don't you have any discernment? Seems I overestimated your emotional intelligence."
 

 
Han Zhi smiled, and after tidying up the tools, he moved next to Tong Zhao and took the liberty of placing the two figures, which were originally far apart, facing each other, as if the little fox was bowing to kiss the rabbit.
 

 
Tong Zhao expressionlessly took the ceramic cups they had made together and turned them upside down over the two ceramic figures, covering them completely.
 

 
To anyone looking at the shelf, it would only appear as an overturned ceramic cup.
 

 
Han Zhi was momentarily stunned, then laughed, "A bit envious—they get to do things that can't be seen by others."
 

 
...
 

 
What are you saying, you old pervert!
 

 
Tong Zhao was surprised and gave him a look.
 

 
Just a moment ago in the ceramic studio, she had kissed him non-stop, making his pale lips redden, and now there was still a trace of that red. Tong Zhao chuckled, "You’re going to watch a movie with glasses girl later, right? Remember to wipe off the lipstick on your mouth. Women are very sensitive to colors; she’s been watching me closely and has a visual memory of the lipstick I use."
 

 
It's also strange.
 

 
Zhong Muxi seemed to pay more attention to her interactions with He Shun than to Han Zhi.
 

 
"Don't wipe it off. It looks good," Han Zhi said casually, as if he didn’t care.
 

 
Going to a movie with another girl while sporting a woman’s lipstick marks?
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t help but pinch his cheek, "Where did you come from, you trendy non-mainstream guy?"
 

 
"Then help me apply it more evenly.”
 

 
Han Zhi took the opportunity to lower his head and kiss her lips. Tong Zhao, still wanting to speak, found her tongue gently claimed by his, like a fox nibbling at a fish cheek, tenderly swirling around. They didn’t close their eyes, almost falling into the depths of each other’s gaze. The kiss was passionate, yet their physical actions remained restrained—no embraces, no crossing lines, which made one relax involuntarily.
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t stand his ease and bit his tongue lightly.
 

 
When he released her, the lipstick marks on his lips were indeed blended naturally.
 

 
"See, it’s all good now."
 

 
Han Zhi lazily squeezed her hand before letting go.
 

 
"Nice technique. Let’s continue next time."
 

 
Han Zhi put his hands in his pockets. "I’m already looking forward to it."
 

 
Tong Zhao stuck out her tongue at him with a victorious grin and turned to leave. After she left, Han Zhi headed toward the kitchen on the first floor. Only half an hour remained before their scheduled 10 p.m. movie date, and he didn’t have much time left.
 

 
*
 

 
There was a mini-theater in the basement of the estate.
 

 
The entire wall was covered with a screen and a projector, with walls on either side filled with film options. These packaged film rights were cheap, but to save even more money, the "Aquaman Kill" program had filled it with old, outdated movies.
 

 
Zhong Muxi arrived early, wandering in the corridor outside the basement entrance twenty minutes ahead of time, pacing back and forth like a ghost.
 

 
She was so nervous just thinking about watching a movie with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
When Han Zhi arrived, he happened to see the bespectacled girl peeking around.
 

 
As their eyes met, Zhong Muxi froze completely.
 

 
She lowered her gaze, avoiding eye contact, clutching her skirt with a sense of self-consciousness.
 

 
Han Zhi acted as if he didn’t notice her awkward and distant behavior and approached with a smile, inviting her, “Shall we go in together?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi responded with a soft "mm," keeping her head down as she entered the mini-theater.
 

 
After they walked in, the door behind them was locked with a beep.
 

 
Zhong Muxi shivered slightly.
 

 
“No need to be nervous. The lock will open once the adventure task is completed,” Han Zhi explained casually, looking around the theater. “The restroom is right next to the screen.”
 

 
“Oh, I’m not nervous,”
 

 
Zhong Muxi attempted to joke, “I look so harmless, there’s no need to worry.”
 

 
It’s actually Han Zhi, a handsome guy like him, who should be worried about his personal safety!
 

 
Han Zhi, fiddling with the projection equipment, didn’t turn around and replied casually, “You’re saying that because you’re nervous. Don’t worry, I’ve prepared some things to help ease your nerves.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was momentarily stunned.
 

 
Han Zhi had selected a few movies he had seen and thought were good for her to choose from. After checking the running times, she picked the shortest one.
 

 
After the movie started, Han Zhi sat down in the seat next to hers, leaving one seat in between.
 

 
This action made Zhong Muxi, who hadn’t had high expectations to begin with, display a moment of embarrassment. It was quickly hidden by her glasses, but she could already foresee how difficult the next hour would be. The thoughts AI captured were like spilled black mud…
 

 
[“I’m sorry, I didn’t want to draw this either. It would be much more enjoyable to watch a movie with someone like Tong Zhao or Xiao Nian, who are cheerful, beautiful, and cute. I shouldn’t even be here; I can’t even have a proper conversation, and I can’t even manage to be a good companion for watching a movie and joking around. I can only awkwardly lower my head, trying to lighten the mood with a joke, but it ends up being neither funny nor timely.”]
 

 
“You can’t watch a movie without this.”
 

 
Han Zhi magically pulled out a large bowl of caramel popcorn, wrapped in plastic wrap, and a serving of soufflé in an insulated box from his backpack, placing them on the seat between them.
 

 
There was only one serving.
 

 
“You mentioned you like cake during Truth or Dare, but there was no time to make a proper cake. I’m afraid this will have to do,” Han Zhi said, unwrapping the plastic wrap, and grabbing a handful of popcorn while watching the screen. The caramel was homemade and still gave off a rich, sweet aroma even after it had set.
 

 
“Oh, right, there’s a spoon too.”
 

 
Han Zhi, as if remembering it belatedly, took out a silver spoon from a cutlery box in his backpack and handed it to the dazed Zhong Muxi before continuing to watch the movie.
 

 
By the time Zhong Muxi realized it, she was already eating the soufflé.
 

 
The sweet, soft taste spread across her lips and tongue, effectively easing her nervousness. Throughout, Han Zhi didn’t turn to look at her, giving her plenty of time to adjust.
 

 
Although he didn’t look at her, Han Zhi was mentally profiling her:
 

 
[This type of girl can be pressured. If you’re a bit tougher with her, she’ll listen. She’ll just think she’s not doing well enough and will follow her boyfriend’s commands in her anxiety... That doesn’t fit my aesthetic; it feels low-grade.]
 

 
[Zhong Muxi is like a flower encased in ice. If you smash it onto the ground, the ice won’t protect the flower. If the goal is just to get the flower, it doesn’t matter how many petals break. But you could also choose to melt the ice with warm water, so the flower remains unharmed.]
 

 
Han Zhi chose a good movie.
 

 
He shared his thoughts with her intermittently.
 

 
Gradually, Zhong Muxi began to respond to him, becoming more relaxed as she spoke.
 

 
As they talked, she confessed, “I’m really sorry. It’s probably better to watch a movie with any other girl than with me.”
 

 
Zhong Muxi was accustomed to seeing herself as a joke.
 

 
Now that she was so relaxed, her words carried a hint of sadness and apology.
 

 
Zhong Muxi felt that her mediocrity was a disservice to Han Zhi.
 

 
Her current self-doubt made her feel deeply apologetic towards herself.
 

 
Han Zhi paused. Turning his head from the screen, he gazed steadily at her:
 

 
“I enjoy watching movies with you. It’s rude to compare you with others,” he said, his tone softening as if he realized his previous words were too harsh. He lowered his eyelashes, speaking in a voice as gentle and soothing as if comforting a child, making her eyes well up: “Even though you might not see me as a potential romantic interest, please don’t bring up other people when we’re watching a movie together, okay?”
 

 
Previously, Han Zhi had deliberately avoided eye contact, minimizing his presence.
 

 
Now, their eyes met suddenly, and his movie-star-level face filled Zhong Muxi’s entire vision. She stared at him, only hearing the sound of her own heart pounding—because of his previous understated and subtle approach, this direct and heartfelt statement was all the more stunning and impactful.
 

 
Who could resist a handsome guy speaking romantic words?
 

 
Zhong Muxi's tongue twisted, and after obediently agreeing, she could no longer focus on the movie.
 

 
Because she realized…
 

 
In Han Zhi’s eyes, she didn’t seem very “safe” either.
 

 
This realization made her a bit happy, as if, due to his special attention, she was once again classified as a “girl.”
 

 
After that, Han Zhi didn’t say much more, and their conversation remained solely about the movie.
 

 
After the movie ended, he escorted Zhong Muxi back to her bedroom door and left.
 

 
His gentlemanly manners were taken for granted.
 

 
What kind of playboy do people imagine?
 

 
A whirlwind of romance, the kind of romantic gestures that dull, straightforward men couldn’t conceive… Han Zhi could achieve that. But rather than simply breaking through defenses, his interest had shifted. He hoped the young girl could rediscover herself by falling for him. He moved slowly, relaxed, and left ample space for poetic imagination, aiming to revive the once stagnant heart that had become a dead pool in the mundane and ordinary life.
 

 
The excitement was the first gift he gave to the glasses-wearing girl.
 

 
---
 

 
That night, after falling asleep, everyone woke up in the holographic filming pod.
 

 
Under the intense variety show shooting schedule, guests must complete the legally mandated amount of exercise during their limited waking hours before they can continue with the filming.
 

 
Tong Zhao rubbed her dizzy head and went to the gym to do warm-up exercises and run.
 

 
She happened to run into the director, who came to check on everyone.
 

 
"The first episode will air soon. I can’t wait to see the audience’s reaction," the director said. Noticing her indifferent expression, he remembered, "Ah, your memory from the variety show hasn't returned yet, right? Don’t worry, your performance as both yourself and your other self was great. All the girls in our production team are completely captivated by Han Zhi."
 

 
"Thank you, director."
 

 
Tong Zhao thanked him.
 

 
She wasn’t surprised at all.
 

 
"But the others still don’t know that a guest is missing. For the sake of the show, please keep it confidential for now. We plan to reveal Han Zhi’s identity only after the entire season airs," the director said in a lower voice.
 

 
After Tong Zhao agreed, the director happily greeted the other guests who were arriving at the gym.
 

 
Duan Ge: [What did Han Zhi do on the show?]
 

 
Han Zhi: [I can’t remember at the moment.]
 

 
[I’m also quite curious,] the gentle voice of the Imperial Concubine Chen said with a hint of annoyance, [You must have done something to me on the variety show. I’m a bit irritated whenever I see you now.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Maybe he did.]
 

 
Duan Ge & Han Zhi & Imperial Concubine Chen: [?]
 

 
……
 

 
The pre-launch activities were well done, and with anticipation all over the internet, the first episode of “Sea King Killer” is about to air.
 

 
In the pre-show clips, one of them features a solo performance by the mysterious amateur male guest, Han Zhi.
 

 
BGM: “He Was Just Passing By”
 

 
The footage, from the tired glance upon entering the estate to his silent self-introduction, exclusively features shots where he is not smiling. It must be said, while his warm guy style is quite charming, the mysterious and cool image of him in the edits arouses even more curiosity among female netizens.
 

 
— “Sorry, I’m a bit late,”
 

 
— “Hello, I’m Han Zhi, with the character ‘Zhi’ for persistence.”
 

 
The background music reaches the chorus part with the lyrics “Everything is just brushed over…” and the beat, showing his dangerous and sexy side in front of Tong Zhao. It freezes at the moment their lips are about to touch and, just as viewers' emotions and curiosity are at their peak, the screen abruptly turns black, quickly displaying the program's official broadcast time.
 

 
This face, once conquering another world and becoming a top Eastern star, is now recreated in holographic virtual reality!
# Chapter34
Beauty is hard currency.
 

 
A face so handsome that it makes the audience gasp has a promotional effect all on its own.
 

 
The production team of the show "King of the Sea" has clipped many solo segments of Wei Zekai and Han Zhi, using them for pre-release promotion on major short video apps and Weibo. The young master, with his short hair highlighted in gold and brown, looks as aloof and proud as a cat, attracting a lot of older sister and mom fans who just want to pull this big boy into their arms and pat his head.
 

 
Han Zhi has the purest form of high-level looks and a strong presence.
 

 
Many netizens were shocked—
 

 
In an era of information explosion, no handsome man or beautiful woman goes unnoticed. As long as someone is good-looking enough, they can instantly become popular, even if they just appear on "1818 Golden Eye." However, with Han Zhi, they truly know nothing about him. New threads keep popping up on entertainment forums, yet apart from screenshots admiring his looks, there is no other information at all.
 

 
How could that be?
 

 
This isn't just some average-looking guy on the street.
 

 
Han Zhi's face, as captured on camera, is filled with a star-like quality and a strong presence. Even when he first appeared exhausted, with water droplets clinging to his hair, it didn't diminish his dazzling aura in the slightest. He gave the entrance hall the feel of a runway show.
 

 
How could he possibly be a nobody?
 

 
Netizens began to discuss, and the search terms related to "Han Zhi" kept rising. Even those who do not follow the entertainment industry would be intrigued by posts on their Weibo homepage such as [Ahhh, I need to know everything about Han Zhi within three seconds!], [This batch of netizens is useless; it’s been an entire afternoon, and they’ve only managed to dig out Han Zhi’s name!], and [Waiting eagerly for tonight’s premiere of "King of the Sea"!]...
 

 
These kinds of posts have piqued people's interest in Han Zhi and the variety show.
 

 
At this moment, the entire Eastern internet is filled with curiosity about Han Zhi.
 

 
...
 

 
Tong Zhao's fans are also passionately speaking up, but their voices are quite divided.
 

 
[Ahhhh, she should never have gone on a dating variety show, TVT! Manager, come out and die!]
 

 
[Where did this pretty boy come from? Stay away from my Zhao Zhao!]
 

 
These are the "boyfriend fans" who are losing it on the spot.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who played a noble concubine overflowing with femininity, attracted a group of fans who adored her looks. They are quite resistant to her starring in a "strong female lead" movie like *Countdown: 72 Hours*, hoping she would continue down the path of playing charming, seductive women. But instead of getting what they were waiting for, they saw their goddess getting close to another handsome guy on a variety show—how could they not be devastated?
 

 
However, in an era where instinctual variety shows are rampant, this isn't uncommon.
 

 
What happens on these instinct-driven variety shows cannot be taken completely at face value.
 

 
So, most male fans remain steadfast: [As long as they don’t officially announce they're together after the show, she’s still my good wife. Enough said, I forgive you. *[insert meme of wearing a green hat]*.]
 

 
While the male fans are going crazy, the female fans are much more composed.
 

 
[I think this handsome guy and Zhao are quite a good match.]
 

 
[Wait a minute, I remember the rich second-generation heir on the show and the concubine are also good friends. A love triangle is in the works?]
 

 
[If you guys keep talking about this, I won't be sleepy anymore!]
 

 
Whether male or female fans, they at least have some vested interest in this.
 

 
The most pitiful one, however, is Song Wanzhuo.
 

 
The top comment under this trailer's hot discussion tagged this poor "Emperor":
 

 
[Are you even human if you tag Song Wanzhuo after seeing the concubine kissing someone else? I already told you not to tag Song Wanzhuo, so why are you still tagging him? How do you think Song Wanzhuo would feel seeing this?]
 

 
Just as netizens were passionately discussing Han Zhi's divine looks, they suddenly remembered that in *Legend of Emperor Ming*, Song Wanzhuo's feelings toward Tong Zhao were rather unusual. Given that it was an instinct-driven drama, it's impossible to say he didn't feel anything at all. However, the two of them cut ties after filming, so this CP (couple pairing) didn’t really gain much traction.
 

 
But when this was brought up, the main person involved actually replied.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo: [Haha, my heart feels not the slightest ripple, and I’ll be watching the first episode tonight.]
 

 
[Hahahaha, here comes the muddle-headed emperor!]
 

 
[Dream crossover/dog head meme]
 

 
From the bottom of his heart, Song Wanzhuo genuinely believed that watching this variety show wouldn’t stir any emotional waves in him.
 

 
What he loved was the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming*, not Tong Zhao herself. Once the drama was over, the feeling wasn't quite the same. However, he does plan to watch the variety show *King of the Sea*, because he really likes Tong Zhao's looks. Like some male fans who adore delicate beauties, he also hopes Zhao Zhao will always remain beautiful, avoiding roles like Feng Yanqi’s, where she plays a fierce and dominant character...
 

 
In short, he’s confident and staying calm.
 

 
The appearance of the "Dog Emperor" (referring to Song Wanzhuo) turned the previously tense atmosphere into a sea of joyful banter and memes.
 

 
The first episode of *King of the Sea* premiered right on time.
 

 
The holographic screening rooms and online cinemas were packed with viewers.
 

 
Some audience members already had Tong Zhao's fan badge displayed next to their IDs, silently making their presence known.
 

 
For the audience, the introduction of the three ordinary participants felt like filler time, and they chatted and joked around in the bullet comments, not taking it seriously. The production team knew how important the beginning was, so they didn’t give them much screen time; after a brief introduction, the progress bar quickly moved to Wei Zekai’s entrance.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound effects of jingling coins, Young Master Wei stepped out of a luxury car.
 

 
A single line, "Is this it?" made the number of bullet comments surge.
 

 
When he later referred to the large room the guests were supposed to sleep in as "a worker's room," the audience couldn't help but sigh that they were not living in the same world as this young master. If this is considered a "worker's room" in the Wei family, how big and luxurious must the room he actually sleeps in be?
 

 
[This second-generation rich kid is too vivid, he's basically playing himself.]
 

 
[Wei Zekai, debut now! If you don’t get famous, you can always go back to your family’s billion-dollar business. *dog head meme*]
 

 
[Boohoo, that single "Is this it?" broke me, especially while I’m still paying off my mortgage.]
 

 
Some bullet comments explaining the background of Wei Zekai's wealthy family to viewers who were not in the know.
 

 
The thrill brought by the rich, handsome young man sustained the audience’s interest for a while longer.
 

 
However, the audience’s biggest excitement was still about when Han Zhi and Tong Zhao would make their appearances.
 

 
The waiting time for the guests was fast-forwarded at double speed, with a shortcut inserted of Young Master Wei playing a game. After losing three rounds in a row, he irritably spent four sets of 648 yuan on *Honor of Kings* and mumbled under his breath, "Spending money for good karma, hurry up and give me some decent teammates."
 

 
Until night fell, the manor outside was shrouded in a torrential downpour.
 

 
At this point, the editors skillfully played the horror movie soundtrack, as if this sweet dating show was about to turn into a murder mystery in a locked room. In this tense atmosphere of impending storm, there was a commotion at the door. Everyone turned to look—it was the much-anticipated appearance of Tong Zhao.
 

 
This was her first time appearing on screen in a sweet and charming modern style.
 

 
Tong Zhao has been in the limelight recently, and it's about time the audience got used to her beauty.
 

 
But when she appeared in a pure white little dress, the director proudly gave her several close-up shots. Her slender and graceful figure was accentuated by the fitted waist design, creating beautiful curves. The combination of white socks and leather shoes added a touch of cute innocence—every aspect was soft and delicate...
 

 
The audience suddenly realized they still weren't tired of seeing this face.
 

 
Facing the gazes of the other guests, especially the dissatisfied look from Young Master Wei directed at the latecomer, she gave a slight apologetic smile. Her light-colored eyes were filled with a deer-like sense of panic and innocence—so pure, so delicate.
 

 
The bullet comments exploded instantly.
 

 
For a moment, it was a celebration by Tong Zhao’s fans who adored her looks—
 

 
[Ahhhhh, I love this look so much! Give the stylist a full banquet!]
 

 
[Sweet and soft little Loli, I’m in love! I declare that from now on, I’m a dad fan of Zhao Bao! *heart emoji*]
 

 
[Wait a minute, so my wife is going to kiss other men while looking this cute?]
 

 
A quick-handed fan excitedly swapped Tong Zhao’s innocent expression from her entrance onto the body of Yao, the Deer Spirit hero from *Honor of Kings*, and found it to be a perfect match—it was as if she was the real Yao Princess.
 

 
Before the “face-licking” fans could settle down, the narrator introduced the identity card Tong Zhao had drawn for the variety show—
 

 
["The King of the Sea" – "Female Student" Tong Zhao: It's often said that women are made of water, and she is certainly the sweetest femme fatale. Skilled at disguising herself, she can transform into any appearance you desire, like a black lotus flower drifting among men. At school, instead of focusing on credits and exam rankings, the male classmates care more about where they stand in Tong Zhao's heart. To win the top spot, they do everything they can to shower her with attention...]
 

 
[Can Tong Zhao achieve her goal, win this competition, and secure the prize money to treat her critically ill family member?]
 

 
The camera freezes right on the look in her eyes as she gazes at the male guests on set.
 

 
Hidden within is a desire to conquer.
 

 
...
 

 
Ah, Princess Zhao Zhao truly is a "black lotus."
 

 
At this moment, fans who started following her because of *Legend of Emperor Ming* went wild with excitement.
 

 
They love this kind of character setting so much!
 

 
Everyone is quite delighted.
 

 
Especially for Song Wanzhuo, who was watching in the holographic screening room, he was astonished to discover that when he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*, his once lifeless heart seemed to be called back to life, beating wildly—
 

 
What is this...
 

 
Is this the feeling of being moved?
 

 
It was clearly the same person, the same face, but when he met Tong Zhao in private, apart from appreciating her beauty, he never had this kind of heart-pounding feeling.
 

 
While confused, Song Wanzhuo was even more overjoyed.
 

 
It was like seeing his idol make a comeback.
 

 
He thought he would spend the rest of his life only watching edited clips of the concubine from *Legend of Emperor Ming* to get his “sugar rush,” but unexpectedly, he found that same feeling again in *King of the Sea*. Even though he couldn't figure out why, he couldn’t help but post on Weibo.
 

 
@Song Wanzhuo:
 

 
Haha, my youth is back!
 

 
Although he didn’t explicitly say what he was referring to, considering he had mentioned earlier in the day that he was going to watch *King of the Sea*, and this happened to coincide with the time just after Tong Zhao's appearance, fans and onlookers immediately guessed that he was quite fond of Tong Zhao's new look this time. Ever since finishing *Legend of Emperor Ming*, he had gradually transitioned from being an idol to purely being an instinct-driven actor, and this kind of comment was still within his fans' tolerance range...
 

 
After all, there really wasn't any concrete evidence about the two of them.
 

 
Not even staged interactions for publicity; it was clear they were just a "plastic couple" who went their separate ways after filming.
 

 
However, the comments from female fans below his post were tinged with jealousy, gently reminding him—
 

 
[Brother, don’t go crazy. Think about the preview content.]
 

 
[Brother Wanzhuo’s reaction is exactly like a boyfriend fan from our fandom.] This comment was from a fan of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Some more mischievous and sarcastic netizens gave him a blunt reminder: [Your Majesty, your beloved concubine is about to date another man!]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was happily watching the variety show when he saw this highly upvoted comment from a random viewer, and his smile instantly froze on his face.
 

 
Just then, Han Zhi made his appearance in *King of the Sea*.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was watching with bullet comments turned on.
 

 
As soon as Han Zhi appeared, aside from the excited shrieks from fans admiring his looks, there were a bunch of green bullet comments playing on a meme:
 

 
[Hats are being handed out, everyone, put them on in advance.]
 

 
What made things worse was that Song Wanzhuo’s earlier Weibo post had made it to the lower end of the trending list and was being reposted by numerous marketing accounts with laughter, which then synced up with the bullet comments from those watching at the same time—
 

 
[Dog Emperor, I know you’re watching. Make sure to keep your hat on.]
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s mindset instantly shattered.
# Chapter35
Song Wanzhuo used to be a skeptic about love developing from working together.
 

 
Although it's not uncommon for people to be influenced by in-movie emotions, he was known in the industry as a staunchly straight man, famously indifferent to romantic scenes. Even after filming *Legend of Emperor Ming* and clearing his reputation, he felt no flutter in his heart when meeting Tong Zhao in person...
 

 
So, he became a fan of Tong Zhao’s looks.
 

 
A very pure fan of her looks.
 

 
Unlike those boyfriend fans who call Tong Zhao their "wife," he was very noble.
 

 
Until he saw Tong Zhao in *King of the Sea*...
 

 
Forget about calling her "wife"—she was his beloved concubine QAQ!
 

 
In the past, during promotional events and movie screenings, he had plenty of opportunities to see her. Tong Zhao gave Song Wanzhuo the impression of a slightly aloof but polite beauty. Working with her was very pleasant, but no romantic sparks flew. As a hidden fan of her looks, it was perfectly normal for him to admire her beauty...
 

 
But at that moment, Song Wanzhuo realized his pure admiration had transformed.
 

 
He instantly upgraded from a fan of her looks to a boyfriend fan.
 

 
If it weren’t for the paparazzi discovering him and causing trouble for Tong Zhao, he would really want to change his phone's wallpaper to a picture of his beloved. Song Wanzhuo, thinking this way, casually took a few screenshots of Tong Zhao. His beloved concubine truly passed the test from every angle with her breathtaking beauty!
 

 
Her unedited photos are stunning!
 

 
A beauty in a golden age!
 

 
Remembering that this is a month-long dating show, Song Wanzhuo felt both envious and regretful.
 

 
If he had known earlier, he would have squeezed in time to join the show, even for free. Living with his beloved concubine—could it be called a loss? Probably not. The only issue might be that his manager would tear him apart. Moreover, *King of the Sea* wasn’t well-known before the trailer went viral. From any angle, it was unlikely he would be on the show.
 

 
Logically, Song Wanzhuo thought this way.
 

 
But emotionally...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s fingers flew across the screen, crazily posting in the bullet comments:
 

 
[I also want to help Zhao Zhao move her luggage!]
 

 
[Help! What an unbelievably cute profile, Zhao Zhao, please start dating me immediately!]
 

 
[Can’t understand what He Shun can do that I can’t. How can someone who helps her move her luggage not be me?]
 

 
You can’t imagine the happiness of being a boyfriend fan!
 

 
For Song Wanzhuo, who had just been promoted to a boyfriend fan, his happiness lasted less than five minutes.
 

 
To keep the show’s pace tight, after Tong Zhao went upstairs to freshen up, the show quickly moved on to Han Zhi’s appearance.
 

 
At this moment, VIP viewers with special privileges were even sending animated emojis.
 

 
What kind of animation?
 

 
It was the scene where Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were about to kiss.
 

 
In other words, Dog Emperor experienced everything from falling in love to heartbreak in just four and a half minutes, with a hint of being cuckolded, enriching his life experience all at once.
 

 
To make matters worse, as Tong Zhao finished freshening up and walked out of her room in slippers, she made eye contact with Han Zhi.
 

 
Before Song Wanzhuo had a chance to admire his beloved concubine’s cute, fresh look, he heard her voice expressing admiration for Han Zhi, which was in stark contrast to her pure and innocent appearance.
 

 
...
 

 
[Haha, the princess is too cute! Han Zhi is indeed exceptional!]
 

 
[Brothers who think they’re a good match, type “perfect match” on the screen!]
 

 
[Perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match, perfect match]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, calm down! They’re a natural pair of handsome guy and beautiful girl. How can you monsters oppose them? Tong Zhao didn’t debut as an idol, so calling her “wife” won’t get her attention. I suggest you learn to be a mother fan like me. Mommy loves you, and Mommy agrees with your early romance!]
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo’s heart was bleeding.
 

 
He couldn’t help but think—
 

 
Look at him, he’s handsome too, he could be exceptional!
 

 
However, after Han Zhi introduced himself, the bullet comments with green hat jokes were quickly overwhelmed by a tide of female viewers.
 

 
Even the audience was surprised by how quickly things escalated.
 

 
Every star who becomes big has, to some extent, a breakout moment.
 

 
It might be a glimpse of brilliance in their work.
 

 
It could be a random candid photo of a newcomer going viral.
 

 
Even a pre-debut bare-faced look could become a breakout moment; you never know.
 

 
The question is whether one can have such a moment and when it will arrive. No one can say for sure. Even the strongest marketing company can only try desperately and continuously, and the real breakout moment might come from an offhand remark like “It’s impossible to work,” or a candid bare-faced photo uploaded by an ordinary person, which spreads more than a professionally shot photo set done by top photographers, leaving the company frustrated.
 

 
And Han Zhi’s line:
 

 
“I’m Han Zhi, Zhi as in persistent.”
 

 
It was so surprisingly perfect and struck a chord with a large number of female viewers.
 

 
While the typical boyfriend fan mindset was shattered, Song Wanzhuo was not.
 

 
He was quite resentful.
 

 
To become a star, Han Zhi indeed has good looks. While his charm is different from his, Song Wanzhuo still felt he had a right to compete with Han Zhi. At the very least, he was Tong Zhao’s senior. If he were in a relationship with her, he could share resources and connections, offering her a lot of experience...
 

 
Just then, Tong Zhao was sitting on the sofa, drying her hair, and let out a small sneeze.
 

 
Her nose tip was red from rubbing, like a delicate little white rabbit that had been wronged.
 

 
It melted the hearts of the audience.
 

 
It was a direct hit for Lolicon fans!
 

 
Then they heard her, while glancing at Han Zhi, sighing internally: [I really want to sleep with him.]
 

 
The extent of explosive moments in instinctive variety shows is always unpredictable.
 

 
In any case, the buzzwords [exceptional] and [sleep with him] were sure to trend.
 

 
The manager, seeing this scene, almost had a heart attack. He composed himself and consulted with the company about marketing strategies—after all, during the era of instinctive filming, they had seen all sorts of shocking comments. Since nothing really happened, they just needed to manage the narrative to avoid negative backlash.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s sigh hit a chord with many of Han Zhi’s newly arrived fans. They felt the same way, and the mainstream discussions on Weibo leaned towards this newcomer guest being incredibly exceptional, like a walking hormone.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo remained resolute.
 

 
After all, his Weibo also had countless female fans wanting to be with him, and he had received many explicit photos in private messages.
 

 
In terms of charisma, he shouldn’t be left behind.
 

 
Men are always so confident!
 

 
Soon after, the show featured Han Zhi preparing a full meal with limited ingredients.
 

 
...
 

 
Song Wanzhuo really didn’t know how to cook.
 

 
Sigh.
 

 
Fortunately, with the progress of the times and Tong Zhao not relying on selling romantic illusions to attract fans, male fans, while heartbroken, could still focus on posting self-deprecating comments like [I don’t believe it, I need to see them kiss with my own eyes], [What era is this! I don’t mind a polyamorous relationship QAQ], and [If worst comes to worst, I’ll switch to being a CP fan. I can do it]... and similar comments.
 

 
The audience thought this pair of handsome man and beautiful woman might fall in love at first sight.
 

 
Then they heard Tong Zhao, while smiling sweetly and softly, internally mocking Han Zhi, seeing through his true face as a scumbag playboy.
 

 
This AI-captured inner voice at least retained the interest of 30% of the audience.
 

 
"King of the Ocean" isn’t just a romance variety show; it includes elements that test both intelligence and emotional quotient. Viewers who are only interested in pure romance might not be drawn to the show from the introduction, leaving those who are excited about the clash between Han Zhi and the other contestants. When they saw Tong Zhao excessively praising this amateur male guest as if she had fallen for him at first sight, some viewers were disappointed, feeling that the main attraction was gone.
 

 
Who wants to watch a young girl being unilaterally dominated by a scumbag?
 

 
It doesn’t matter how beautiful the female guest is.
 

 
What’s exciting is the back-and-forth, the battle of wits and emotions.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s remark, "There must be a demon behind showing weakness; it’s just a ploy to sell a deep affection persona," struck a chord with the audience, resonating well.
 

 
They were hooked!
 

 
Thus, the audience honestly stayed tuned.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t disappoint; her subsequent inner thoughts continuously hit the smart AI’s sweet spots and were played one after another. She critiqued every male guest, behaving like a noble and picky beautiful cat, with humans offering various treats and services, yet not necessarily winning her favor.
 

 
If you ask why?
 

 
Ah, that’s the wonderful thing about the little cat—it’s inscrutable.
 

 
During filming, the production team thought Tong Zhao’s "true self" was too much of a green tea (i.e., manipulative), and that it might be off-putting if released. Male viewers couldn’t bring themselves to dislike her, given her stunning looks (field assistant interjects: "You straight guys probably can’t even see where she’s being green tea"), but female viewers’ impressions of her might have been significantly diminished…
 

 
However, the production team missed something.
 

 
From the omniscient perspective of female viewers, since this isn’t a serious pure romance show, they accepted Tong Zhao’s role as a scheming woman and even identified with her.
 

 
This sense of identification is the most lethal.
 

 
Who hasn’t dreamed of being a beautiful woman charming the world?
 

 
If you had Tong Zhao’s face, most people probably wouldn’t be dating ordinary men.
 

 
Even if it’s 1v1, it would be with a handsome guy like Han Zhi.
 

 
So what if she’s picky?
 

 
She deserves it!
 

 
Female viewers identified with her perspective. A beautiful woman who is both clear-headed and rational, with high emotional intelligence—playing with a self-important man like He Shun is simply exhilarating.
 

 
A small portion of male viewers' dissatisfaction was drowned out by the mainstream wave.
 

 
[The real face of the green tea girl is indeed scary.]
 

 
[Wait until she turns thirty, and then others will be able to pick on her.]
 

 
[What kind of strange species are those who keep calling her a green tea girl on the bullet screen? Hurry up and block them. Our Zhao Zhao will still be a wealthy, beautiful woman who’s out of your league even after she turns thirty!]
 

 
The stricter the moral guardians are in real life, the more excited the audience becomes about the "immorality" in instinctive variety shows. After all, she hasn’t done anything wrong. She came to this show fully prepared to be a schemer and to be schemed against. A little bit of cunning, is she a green tea cat or what? Even the poop scooping job isn’t fit for losers!
 

 
The debate brought attention.
 

 
And the catalyst for ending the debate about green tea was a little puppy.
 

 
The dog was transformed by Wei Zekai.
 

 
The production team’s sensational move truly shocked the audience.
 

 
The key is that, according to the promotional material before the show aired, Wei Zekai was portrayed as the cat-like handsome man in the show—aloof and noble, like an expensive Siberian Forest cat, nearly twenty thousand per cat. Love it or leave it, and even if you buy it, it’ll give you a super fierce look.
 

 
Then he turned into a little dog.
 

 
The twist came so suddenly that it shocked the audience and left them astounded.
 

 
#LetHanZhiDebut# and #RichSecondGenerationDoesn'tActLikeAHuman# both trended on social media, with Han Zhi leading due to his exceptional looks, while Wei Zekai’s puzzled "woof" followed closely behind.
 

 
The passersby were quite amused.
 

 
The second-generation circle who knew Wei Zekai laughed uncontrollably.
 

 
Meanwhile, the Wei family elders, who had heard that their only son had invested in several entertainment industry projects recently, were not optimistic. They criticized him as an unfilial son and suggested he should have just donated the money to charity to save on taxes.
 

 
Despite their complaints, he was still the only child.
 

 
How could they not watch him on the show?
 

 
And upon watching, they saw their son had even changed species.
# Chapter36
The Wei family gathered together.
 

 
Wei Zekai had parents above him, and above them were his grandparents. His maternal grandparents also came from a scholarly family. Six people doted on him as their precious grandson, spoiling him to the point where he had a haughty attitude. No one in the Wei family was innocent in this. Fortunately, though the young master was arrogant, his nature hadn't been twisted; he was fundamentally kind-hearted.
 

 
Father Wei looked at Tong Zhao and felt she looked familiar. "Has this pretty girl been to our house before?"
 

 
He was busy with work and, even when he managed to come home, didn't have much to say to his son.
 

 
But Wei Zekai didn't have many friends—
 

 
His mouth was too sharp, and his emotional intelligence was even lower. The number of friends he could bring home was even fewer.
 

 
Tong Zhao was one of them.
 

 
"Xiao Kai brought her over to hang out before, and he also posted a group photo with his friends on Weibo," Mother Wei reminded him.
 

 
"Zesheng, what is this program about?"
 

 
Grandfather Wei didn't quite understand; he just saw his precious grandson transformed into a corgi. He hesitated and asked, "Is this a pet dating show?”
 

 
Mother Wei patiently explained, and only then did the old man understand.
 

 
The dating show was indeed a real matchmaking show, but their grandson was the pet.
 

 
On the show, there was also a bad woman and a bad man, and their grandson was responsible for exposing the two of them.
 

 
Grandmother Wei frowned as she listened. "Letting Xiao Kai take on such a responsibility? The director must not be thinking clearly."
 

 
"Isn't this show one of his investments? Maybe he paid for the judge position," someone speculated. The Wei family hadn’t watched the promotional videos for the show and didn’t know the roles were drawn randomly, so they assumed that their wealthy young master had paid a large sum to buy the role of the dog.
 

 
"Then he's not thinking clearly either," Father Wei concluded.
 

 
The relatives all nodded in agreement.
 

 
After watching the show for a while longer, seeing Wei Zekai's emotional and social intelligence almost hitting rock bottom, Mother Wei suddenly said, "I’ve always said this child takes after his father."
 

 
Father Wei sneered and shot back, "Are we resorting to personal attacks now? Why not mention how, when you were pregnant with Xiao Kai, you were supposed to eat more walnuts to boost brainpower, but you refused because you didn’t want to crack your teeth. You drank eight glasses of water a day, and it all went straight to our son's head."
 

 
"Heh.”
 

 
Both of them felt that if things continued like this, it would be difficult to solve the family's heir problem without having a second child.
 

 
While the immediate family members were whispering about whether this child took after the father or the mother, the audience, on the other hand, found that the rich second-generation kid turning into a dog was extremely adorable. The way he wobbled around on short legs, furiously wagging his little tail, was like a healing little angel. Especially when he cautiously hid away—it was turned into a bunch of reaction memes...
 

 
Unfortunately, Young Master Wei wasn’t a celebrity or an internet influencer, so there weren’t many places to use this set of reaction memes.
 

 
Only the comment section under his personal Weibo was flooded with them.
 

 
Originally, it was filled with trend-following jokes like "Young Master Wei, give us something." But now, it had turned into [Wei dog Watching Secretly.jpg], [Suddenly Transformed into a Dog.jpg], and [Wei dog, Light of Justice.jpg]...
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai had just woken up from the holographic filming pod, and his memory hadn’t fully recovered yet. When he opened WeChat, he was stunned.
 

 
Still groggy, he saw that his Moments and WeChat messages were filled with images of a silly corgi.
 

 
Young Master Wei didn’t like dogs—he was on Team Predators.
 

 
His dream was that one day, if keeping tigers as private pets became legal in China, he would keep one in his garden at home—after all, he could afford it.
 

 
He opened the WeChat group of the "Young Master Wei Charity Foundation"...
 

 
It was the group where he partnered with Tong Zhao for investments, and it was flooded with dog memes. Instantly, he was very annoyed.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Stop using stupid dog memes. Use some normal ones.]
 

 
Heir A: [...]
 

 
Heir B: [...]
 

 
Heir C: [...Uh, well.]
 

 
By the time Wei Zekai realized that the stupid dog was actually him, it was already two minutes too late to recall the message.
 

 
When it rains, it pours. The joys and sorrows between people don’t always connect. As soon as Young Master Wei realized the situation and became furious out of embarrassment, his friends had already posted this chat record on Weibo to farm likes and shares.
 

 
Sure enough, the silly netizens laughed their heads off on the spot.
 

 
[Help, is this really the dog young master’s IQ?]
 

 
[If this show airs, the stock price of the Wei Group might drop by half. The future looks bleak!]
 

 
["Drop by half? My foot! As a dog fan, I hereby declare myself a spiritual shareholder of the Wei Group from now on. I heard that the Wei Group is a diversified enterprise? Has the big boss considered developing a pet product line as a side business? You’ve got a ready-made spokesperson who can work for free /dog head emoji/ dog head emoji/"]
 

 
Just as Young Master Wei was experiencing social death, the show "King of the Sea" aired the segment where the two contestants who drew the King of the Sea cards were confronting each other face-to-face.
 

 
The game hidden beneath the sweet atmosphere was shot like a movie, turning the variety show into something cinematic.
 

 
The director of "King of the Sea" didn’t have much filming experience. For a variety show, being able to edit and find highlights is enough. Not knowing how to create beautiful compositions can even be justified as "showing the real side"… In short, this director's skills were far inferior to those of "Legend of Emperor Ming," but the two contestants had great on-screen chemistry, and every glance they exchanged told a story.
 

 
The two disguised as "King of the Sea" seemed to drop their facades entirely in the pottery room—
 

 
But the AI smart system that captured their inner thoughts told a different story.
 

 
While molding a fox figurine out of clay, Tong Zhao was cursing the producers in her mind for being so inhumane: [Why can’t we do R-rated things? That’s the fastest way to expose a man’s true colors. Wouldn’t it be more straightforward to have him kneel under my bed and tell the truth?]
 

 
The audience nodded frantically in agreement.
 

 
Han Zhi's inner thoughts were filled with sighs: [So difficult to figure out. I've never seen someone like her before; it's hard to guess what she's thinking. Her face is also quite misleading. Hmm, it's tough to look her in the eyes; she's too beautiful.]
 

 
While thinking this, their gazes intertwined once again, lingering like an eternity in a single glance.
 

 
The air was filled with a sweet atmosphere that seemed like marriage was the only way this could end.
 

 
Even through the screen, the audience could feel the intense attraction pulling them towards each other.
 

 
As their scenes played out, the number of viewers in the streaming room and the barrage of comments surged rapidly.
 

 
The backend provided the most objective and accurate data collection, analyzing the four most frequently appearing keywords: [I ship this], [driving], [ZhiZhao], and [ZhaoZhi]. This couple was so easy to ship that no additional marketing was needed; CP (couple pairing) fans were naturally born. However, this also brought about some conflicts.
 

 
Han Zhi and Tong Zhao—who would take the lead position?
 

 
When the main actors actually kissed, fans were in uproar—not just for sweet moments, but for clarity on the dynamic—
 

 
[Tong Zhao pulled Han Zhi over for the kiss; isn't it clear who's on top and who's on bottom?]
 

 
[I absolutely can't accept Tong Zhao being the bottom. Having Han Zhi dominate her? I'd rather pair her up with Wei dog.]
 

 
[How can love exist between different species?]
 

 
The Zhao-Zhi shippers felt that their beloved sister was a proper and serious star, while Han Zhi, no matter how handsome, was still a nobody.
 

 
On the other hand, the Zhi-Zhao shippers held onto their traditional beliefs, arguing that their “Brother Zhi” grabbed the back of her head and kissed her back, so why shouldn’t the man be in the leading position? Didn’t they sense the tons of testosterone emanating from Brother Zhi?
 

 
In the end, a highly upvoted comment was highlighted in red:
 

 
[Stop arguing. Would you mind if this ship had one more fan? I’m joining this family right away.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s personal fans felt a strong sense of crisis.
 

 
They were worried that Han Zhi might be a new rising star heavily promoted by some company, trying to ride on the popularity of their Sister Zhao. They quickly showed up to claim Zhao Zhao, saying “Not interested, don’t bring her into this,” subtly and overtly expressing disdain for the good-looking amateur.
 

 
Fan circles especially detest stepping on each other's toes, and the discussion area instantly turned into chaos.
 

 
At the same time, Xu Zhu was also watching “King of the Sea.”
 

 
Last time, her stepsister had caused her to lose a lot of face. Finally, the hype over her kneeling video had died down, but she also lost a lot of fans who came for her sweet image and "little princess" persona. The filming of "Star Selection Girls" had ended, and Xu Zhu, who debuted thanks to her backstage connections, was now bored at home with nothing to do. She spent her free time plotting to prevent her stepsister from going viral again.
 

 
There was no helping it—her stepsister was just too infuriating.
 

 
The audience was quite forgiving, and as a result, Xu Zhu attracted a new group of fans who enjoyed watching a "selfish diva." She also unexpectedly landed a film offer that aligned perfectly with the character of "Feng Sisi." Her resources were surprisingly good—truly absurd.
 

 
But Xu Zhu didn't want to take it.
 

 
She was fixated on wanting to be the "little princess."
 

 
Why should Tong Zhao get to play positive roles and rise to fame?
 

 
She couldn’t stand that her stepsister got all the benefits.
 

 
So, this time, with Tong Zhao risking it all on an instinct-based variety show, Xu Zhu kept a close eye on her, just hoping to see her sister cause a scandal out of the blue. When she saw Chang Xiaonian badmouthing Tong Zhao, calling her a “white lotus green tea b*tch”...
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she wanted to become a sworn sisters with Chang Xiaonian!
 

 
This must be the long-lost sister she was meant to find!
 

 
Finally, someone saw through her stepsister's true colors, and Xu Zhu's eyes welled up with tears.
 

 
However, the reactions on the bullet screen and Weibo once again nearly made her vomit blood in anger. Even when Tong Zhao was exposed as a manipulative flirt, the audience still liked her, thinking she was charming in her wickedness—a proud little kitten who deserved to be pampered and win in the end. Xu Zhu stared at the screen until her eyes were red, and at last, she glimpsed an opportunity to smear her stepsister's reputation.
 

 
The amateur handsome guy who got close with her stepsister became an overnight sensation.
 

 
Just like many of Tong Zhao’s fans thought, Xu Zhu suspected that things weren't that simple. She believed Han Zhi was very likely an artist that some company was planning to promote heavily. The more one knows about the industry, the less they believe in random fame.
 

 
Xu Zhu dared to be certain that Han Zhi hadn’t signed with any entertainment company only after using her connections with the Tong family to inquire multiple times.
 

 
He was truly just a regular guy.
 

 
A very, very lucky guy who participated in a mediocre show, created some incredible chemistry, and then garnered attention and a fan base that even many marketing companies couldn’t buy with money.
 

 
It was rumored that a wealthy lady who loved following celebrities took a fancy to him and spared no effort or expense to build a fan support club for him.
 

 
The fan support club, screenshots, beautified essays—everything was arranged.
 

 
Strangely, even though there was no company backing him, Han Zhi's fan base grew rapidly like weeds, with astonishing combat effectiveness, and soon it took shape.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t indulge in romantic fantasies, so her fan base was relatively calm and mature.
 

 
Han Zhi, however, was different. His persona on the variety show was that of a super flirtatious "King of the Sea.”
 

 
The fans Han Zhi attracted were mostly irrational, younger "girlfriend fans."
 

 
To put it bluntly, if even an ordinary girl like Zhong Muxi could get his "emotional charity," then these girlfriend fans—though not comparable to a female celebrity like Tong Zhao—could certainly compare themselves to someone like Zhong Muxi! "King of the Sea, notice me!"
 

 
Because Han Zhi's attitude toward Tong Zhao was different, his girlfriend fans naturally disliked her.
 

 
Anyone who opposed her stepsister was Xu Zhu's ally.
 

 
Xu Zhu immediately found this handsome guy pleasing to the eye. She took the opportunity to buy a large number of cheap internet trolls to mix into Han Zhi's fan groups and stir up trouble... After all, fan groups that have just formed are the most chaotic and fragile, unlike the more disciplined, established fandoms. This gave her a chance to exploit the situation.
 

 
[Why are you calling her "sister-in-law"? What happens on a variety show doesn’t represent reality, okay? Brother Zhi still doesn’t know his commercial value. Once he wakes up from the filming pod, he’ll realize that a whole world of opportunities is waiting for him.]
 

 
[Only older ladies would believe the scripts of instinct-based variety shows, hehe.]
 

 
[Is your idol unable to find a partner? Why do you have to pair her up with a new amateur? Taking Brother Zhi away, not interested.]
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi's girlfriend fans and Tong Zhao’s fans fighting fiercely, Xu Zhu smiled with satisfaction.
# Chapter37
With the help of the cheap internet trolls, Han Zhi’s fame became even more overwhelming.
 

 
What initially started as a fan frenzy composed of casual viewers turned into something commercialized once the trolls got involved. Xu Zhu didn’t care about the man named Han Zhi, but she wanted to use his girlfriend's fans to severely undermine her stepsister’s reputation. The more Han Zhi’s fans, the better; the more irrational and combative they were, the more damaging they would be to Tong Zhao.
 

 
Seeing the internet trolls she deployed stirring up trouble on Tong Zhao’s Weibo, Xu Zhu felt a sense of satisfaction.
 

 
Life was truly wonderful.
 

 
Just imagine, if at this moment another female star of the same age as Tong Zhao were in the spotlight, Xu Zhu would have to consider whether helping her might create a potential competitor.
 

 
But Han Zhi was a man.
 

 
No matter how much he was promoted, he wouldn’t become a stumbling block for Xu Zhu’s rise.
 

 
How could things be so perfect?
 

 
Xu Zhu felt like she was almost becoming a fan of Han Zhi.
 

 
With the paid trolls creating a buzz, Han Zhi managed to attract a huge amount of attention and traffic with just one episode of the variety show. His fans firmly believed that their idol was exceptional, with a bright future of boundless opportunities, and that Tong Zhao didn’t deserve him!
 

 
At the same time, within the production team of *King of the Sea*, they were discussing changes to the filming format with the guests.
 

 
There are two types of formats for instinct-based variety shows.
 

 
One is live broadcasting, like *Countdown 72 Hours*, and the other involves filming a set number of episodes in advance and then airing them, as is the case now. The former requires higher technical standards and is relatively more costly. *King of the Sea* only had Tong Zhao as a celebrity guest and was following a path of building reputation through a small-scale approach, but once the show aired, everything changed.
 

 
The viewership ratings soared from silver to gold.
 

 
The scenes of the two "Kings of the Sea" confronting each other were incredibly captivating. With additional marketing and hype, the show's viewership even rose to platinum levels.
 

 
Wei Zekai asked, “Wasn’t the plan to proceed steadily? Does the live format need approval? Will it be timely?”
 

 
He had only a vague understanding of the entertainment industry and invested in *King of the Sea* primarily because of his good friend.
 

 
“Our show’s ratings have reached platinum level!” the director reminded him.
 

 
Wei Zekai hesitated, “So, what’s the difference?”
 

 
At this point, the director became excited.
 

 
“In terms of viewership ratings, black iron, bronze, and silver are one level, gold is average, and mainstream variety shows and dramas that are considered good quality in the industry are usually gold level... Platinum, diamond, and emerald are in a different league altogether.
 

 
“Reaching platinum ratings means we’ve hit the threshold for being nominated for annual awards. Sponsorships... before, we had to beg for them, but now it's their turn to seek us out. With the audience loving the show, everything is falling into place! The show is starting to make money!”
 

 
According to the data captured from the backstage, Tong Zhao was credited with the primary achievement.
 

 
In reality, Han Zhi's mysterious rise to fame was the main reason.
 

 
But since they are the same person, it meant Tong Zhao’s success was compounded. There was no more to be rewarded, only admiration.
 

 
As a result, the entire production team praised her endlessly, both internally and externally. Outsiders wanted to dig up some dirt on Tong Zhao, but given her “true self” displayed on the show, which showed she was not only far from a saint but also quite scheming, they only ended up being showered with praise and flattery, no matter how much they inquired.
 

 
Firstly, Tong Zhao’s contributions were indeed significant.
 

 
Secondly, her easygoing nature and high level of cooperation.
 

 
“I always said that inviting Tong Zhao was a stroke of luck for you, Director. The show making money was only a matter of time; otherwise, would I have joined?”
 

 
The director passionately praised Tong Zhao, and Wei Zekai’s eyes lit up. He put his arm around the director's shoulder, and they became quite friendly.
 

 
He had only understood the part about “starting to make money.”
 

 
The project he invested in was starting to make money!
 

 
Tong Zhao was amazing!
 

 
The two hit it off immediately, and while hugging each other, they boasted, “Well, I think we don’t need any more sponsors. I have cooperation agreements with several companies, so I’ll take the lead. As for me, Wei Zekai, I may lack in other areas, but I’m never short of money!”
 

 
The director, though average in filming skills, was top-notch in handling relationships and skillfully made Wei Zekai very happy.
 

 
Not only did he agree to additional investment, but he also forgot about the matter of the production team turning him into a small dog.
 

 
With platinum-level ratings enhancing the show’s prestige and Wei Zekai’s generous support, the approval for live broadcasting was quickly granted. The *King of the Sea* production team hurriedly posted on Weibo to announce the good news.
 

 
@King of the Sea:
 

 
[Episode 3 will start airing in a live format under the emotional classification in instinct-based variety shows. The success of the show is closely tied to everyone's support, and we hope it continues to improve! PS: After the guest adjustments, filming will start tomorrow morning at 7 AM. The edited version will be released later. Users who purchased the live viewing rights can download it for free using the same ID, without needing to make another purchase.]
 

 
This announcement struck like a thunderbolt, and the comments on Weibo were filled with anticipation.
 

 
[Really? We can now admire the sister's beautiful face anytime, anywhere!]
 

 
[I checked, and *King of the Sea* has reached platinum level. Tong Zhao truly is a star-making machine. I remember the episodes of *The Ming Emperor's Chronicles* that saw a surge in viewership also had her appearances, right?]
 

 
The program’s rating level is publicly accessible, and netizens came back to congratulate.
 

 
Only Han Zhi's fans started making sour comments.
 

 
[Some fans are too good at controlling the narrative. Are all the credits really due to her?]
 

 
[Please check the number of search terms. Han Zhi related to the show is also doing well. Our brother is low-key and doesn’t seek credit, but that doesn’t mean he should be invisible, okay?]
 

 
[The official account tagged all the guests but not Han Zhi. Please treat Han Zhi fairly.]
 

 
Fans are particularly sensitive to differential treatment.
 

 
Generally speaking, due to the large number of onlookers under the official Weibo account, the two fan groups did not directly clash but each made sour remarks in their own comment sections. Han Zhi's fans felt that the production team was harsh on Han Zhi to promote Tong Zhao and expressed their sympathy:
 

 
[Yes, before the broadcast, Tong Zhao’s appeal was indeed needed, and we don’t deny that she should be thanked. I only learned about *King of the Sea* because of her. But now that Han Zhi has demonstrated his value, can’t the production team give him fair treatment? We’re not asking for special treatment, just fairness.]
 

 
[Is it possible that Han Zhi doesn’t use Weibo…]
 

 
[Are there really people who don’t use Weibo these days?]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s fans, on the other hand, were relatively rational but still felt sorry for her from a different perspective:
 

 
[She put in so much effort to make the show a success, and yet she’s still being criticized. The princess is so unlucky.]
 

 
[It’s like tearing down the bridge after crossing it—very frustrating.]
 

 
[Have you noticed that there seems to be constant media manipulation to incite our fans to argue with those of others? Focus on your own side; who knows, by the end of the show, that person might become our brother-in-law.]
 

 
At this point, both sides were feeling a bit deflated.
 

 
The production team noticed the situation and was about to seek Tong Zhao’s opinion on whether to reveal Han Zhi’s identity in advance to prevent any further misinformation or deceitful behavior toward fans.
 

 
Before the director could make a decision, another issue arose.
 

 
Originally, male guest Lu Yiqi was released on bail for drunk driving, and upon seeing the show’s success and Han Zhi, who had replaced him, becoming extremely popular, he was dumbfounded. He was just a minor internet celebrity and had admitted his mistake in drunk driving, accepting missing out on a golden opportunity. But after seeing the rhythm brought by Xu Zhu’s hired trolls, claiming that Han Zhi had million-dollar endorsement deals waiting…
 

 
Without a manager to stop him and having no peanuts at home, Lu Yiqi, having drunk a bit too much, got emotional and started a live broadcast on Weibo to complain.
 

 
His popularity was low, but alcohol made him particularly bold. The topics he discussed were trending, and fans and curious netizens flocked to his livestream, pushing his small broadcast to the top ten in real-time trending.
 

 
“Yes, it’s my fault that I drank and drove. I accept the criticism; alcohol is truly not a good thing.”
 

 
“Can’t I have a day or two? Seeing the person who replaced me being so popular makes me really upset.”
 

 
“Stop criticizing me. I know I have flaws, but who is completely clean?”
 

 
"I was the one caught on the day of filming. Holographic variety shows are filmed for 24 hours straight. Every guest had to go through a medical examination and submit it for approval. It's fine if someone is temporarily absent, but not if someone is added last minute. I really don’t know what methods the production team used to add a new person at the last moment."
 

 
When people are distressed, their thinking can become skewed.
 

 
Lu Yiqi became increasingly frustrated as he spoke, even adding conspiracy theories: "I had prepared to apologize for delaying the shoot, but then Xiao Zhang told me everything was still going as planned... Illegal methods? I don’t think so. I just feel... they must have wanted to replace me all along! They just didn’t tell me."
 

 
"Look at the recent hot searches. The person who replaced me has a much stronger background than I do."
 

 
"I'm not confused. The person simply doesn’t exist. Damn it."
 

 
Lu Yiqi was taking it simply; he just couldn’t accept it.
 

 
Xu Zhu’s cheap hired trolls were eager to hype up Han Zhi, wishing he would become a top star by the end of the show.
 

 
Fans hadn’t started dreaming yet, but Lu Yiqi’s mentality had already collapsed.
 

 
The most painful part was not having had the opportunity; it was that he could have had it.
 

 
Lu Yiqi believed he could have been in that position too.
 

 
Fans of Han Zhi, who were mentioned in the live broadcast, flooded into the stream, took screenshots, and posted them in the comments. They made a collage with Han Zhi’s picture and wrote five big words: “[You can’t do it],” and “[Even without you, our brother is still popular].” Some fans also quoted Yang Li’s famous saying, “They look so ordinary, but they can be so confident,” to emphasize their main point—“You don’t deserve it.”
 

 
The competition with Tong Zhao’s fans was seen as positive and constructive.
 

 
It was really embarrassing to be overshadowed by an internet celebrity like Lu Yiqi, who relied on beauty filters to look handsome and was just riding the coattails of the show’s success.
 

 
The fans who were swept up by the hype from hired trolls felt that their idol was about to break out of Asia and looked down on Lu Yiqi, rejecting any association or comparison.
 

 
This wasn’t really an issue initially.
 

 
But someone pointed out a crucial detail—
 

 
Even with a fast approval process for adding people to the variety show, it would still take a day or two.
 

 
This is common knowledge in the industry.
 

 
So why does "Sea King Kill" have special privileges?
 

 
This isn't the first time someone has been bold enough to make such a move; at that time, the show’s production team chose to remove the temporary guest to maintain the overall situation. Delving deeper, if there were any dirty dealings, the show would have to keep adjusting and striving for survival.
 

 
Han Zhi’s recent popularity is undeniable, but his small fans weren't delusional enough to think the production team would sacrifice the bigger picture for him, and they were immediately panicked.
 

 
Xu Zhu's hired trolls didn't provide after-sales service and weren’t genuinely interested in promoting Han Zhi.
 

 
It would be better if "Sea King Kill" failed altogether; Xu Zhu would be willing to abstain from meat for a year in exchange for Tong Zhao’s failure. She would be delighted if Tong Zhao's career ended abruptly.
 

 
But that was just wishful thinking.
 

 
How could this be related to Tong Zhao?
 

 
She wasn’t the one breaking the law; if Han Zhi were removed, she would only be consolidating her achievements, which would actually benefit her.
 

 
However, just as Han Zhi's younger fans were anxiously in tears, like headless flies, someone they hadn’t even considered stepped forward.
 

 
@TongZhaoV:
 

 
"I guarantee that Han Zhi’s appearance in 'Sea King Kill' is compliant with all regulations."
 

 
@Lu Yiqi only got one thing right: if he hadn't been so clueless, Han Zhi wouldn’t have appeared at all.
# Chapter38
No one expected Tong Zhao to step up and speak out.
 

 
At first glance, her post on Weibo seemed to be a clarification for the show.
 

 
But upon closer inspection, it carried more weight in protecting Han Zhi.
 

 
Since her debut, she had never publicly argued with anyone or engaged in drama. Her fans didn’t expect her to suddenly show her true colors and throw a jab at Lu Siqi. Han Zhi’s fans were also touched by how she stood up for him. Just as both fanbases were ready to rally behind her with cheers and support, they simultaneously began to think in the same direction—
 

 
Wait, could they really be dating?
 

 
After exiting the filming pod and regaining their memories, there was a high chance the two of them genuinely liked each other.
 

 
Amid the brewing undercurrents, the production team of "Sea King Kill" belatedly released some behind-the-scenes footage, along with an approval document.
 

 
With an official document, things became clearer!
 

 
Han Zhi’s fans’ eyes lit up; whether their idol was being backed by strong connections or was a legal figure, the former seemed much better.
 

 
However, some observant fans clicked to read the text more carefully and became even more puzzled.
 

 
The approval document wasn’t the “Long-term Instinct Film Crew Declaration” but rather the “Instinct Film Dissociative Identity Declaration (Supplementary)”...
 

 
Most casual viewers and fans don’t bother reading the text carefully. Instead, they chose to click on the easier-to-understand behind-the-scenes footage.
 

 
After a brief buffering period, the first thing that came up was an exclamation filled with shock and a strong curse:
 

 
“Damn it—Lu Siqi got thrown in jail? For what? Overusing beauty filters?”
 

 
In the busy backstage area of the “Sea King Kill” production, the entire crew had gathered, methodically adjusting the equipment. Through the monitoring window, you could see the filming pods lit with breathing lights and some of the waiting guests. Although the camera was a bit shaky and there was no timestamp, viewers quickly figured out from the rich visual information that this was shot right before “Sea King Kill” was about to start filming.
 

 
Upon hearing the news from the staff, the director's face changed dramatically.
 

 
“Oh no, he really can’t make it? Messing with our plans like this, what the [bleep], has he [bleeped—] himself? We already have few enough guests, and now we’re missing one entirely. What does the contract say—can we sue him for damages?”
 

 
“That’s not the main issue. The problem is that the filming pod we rented can’t be rescheduled.”
 

 
“If we wait for him, we’ll have to rent the pod again. If we proceed without him, the result definitely won’t be good.”
 

 
“I’m really fed up with this!”
 

 
When they learned that Lu Siqi had been caught drunk driving and sustained minor injuries, making it impossible for him to arrive at the filming site today, several core members started cursing. Even though the curses were bleeped out, their unanimous angry expressions made it clear to uninformed viewers just how much trouble Lu Siqi had caused everyone.
 

 
The viewers who initially wanted to criticize the production team also felt their anger subside a bit after seeing this.
 

 
This was truly an unexpected disaster for them.
 

 
The cost of a holographic filming pod is extremely high, not to mention the medical team on standby. With all the layers of approvals, it involves a lot of personal connections, money, and time, none of which can be wasted. Who among the working class hasn’t encountered this situation? After working hard to prepare everything, only to have it ruined by some idiot, leaving everyone stuck between a rock and a hard place.
 

 
What could they do?
 

 
As the background music filled with intense, heavy drumbeats, the sense of urgency spread throughout the backstage.
 

 
“I have a suggestion,” the modeler suddenly spoke up, “I think it might be the only solution right now. But if it fails, it could make things worse for the show, and she might not agree to it…”
 

 
“Stop keeping us in suspense! Just tell us already!”
 

 
The director urged him on.
 

 
However, the behind-the-scenes footage didn’t show the modeler’s explanation. Instead, the camera cut to the director, looking tense as he walked from backstage to the filming room, glancing around for someone. At this moment, Tong Zhao arrived on set.
 

 
The director quietly explained to her why the guest was absent.
 

 
Then he got to the most crucial part: “We could create another male model for you, as if you have the ability to change gender with this Sea King card in the variety show.”
 

 
At this point, the viewers’ eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Oh my god, this plot twist is mind-blowing!
 

 
Even casual onlookers without a stake in the matter were stunned, let alone the fans from both sides, who were so bewildered that they even forgot to control the comments. If they were whales, the ocean would surely echo with a resounding chorus of “What the hell!” bouncing back and forth like a "What the hell!" plaza.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage continued.
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed to this outrageous request and even rejected the production team's original conservative suggestion of “one person with two genders.” In the initial plan, they only wanted to create a male model for her without splitting her consciousness, which would have been safer for her.
 

 
Just like how Wei Zekai could transform into a dog and wouldn't appear in human and dog form at the same time, the male and female versions of Tong Zhao wouldn’t either. It was simply giving her the ability to switch identities and perform as both.
 

 
Tong Zhao willingly chose to bear a heavier burden by splitting her consciousness into two.
 

 
That's how Han Zhi came to be.
 

 
The behind-the-scenes footage recorded the birth of "Han Zhi" in fast-forward mode. He was created from a scanned projection of Tong Zhao's imagination. Such a split consciousness act, like that of Sun Wukong duplicating himself, couldn't simply be generated by forcing a random model into existence. A person's self-awareness is a highly sensitive thing; if a model were forcibly created and Tong Zhao's consciousness shoved into it, the version of her appearing in the instinct-based variety show would constantly question her own existence.
 

 
The higher the compatibility, the more natural it appears, and the more it resembles a genuinely real person.
 

 
Like the previous movie King who played two roles himself, it was the clever use of character settings that blended the points of self-doubt into the narrative conflicts.
 

 
Yet Han Zhi, this hastily made creation, somehow achieved 100% compatibility with Tong Zhao’s "true self.”
 

 
When the modeling was completed and half of Tong Zhao's consciousness was infused, the originally fast-forwarded playback suddenly slowed down.
 

 
The process of inserting a guest into the instinctive variety show often resembles scenes from an infinite-stream novel, appearing in places that wouldn't raise suspicion. This time was no exception. Han Zhi, neatly dressed, slowly opened his eyes in a high-end hotel elevator, and in that instant, his flawlessly handsome face was endowed with a soul.
 

 
Those gentle, melancholic eyes became the initial attraction for countless fans.
 

 
The astonished exclamations of "What the hell?" suddenly fell silent.
 

 
In the short behind-the-scenes video, viewers witnessed the birth of Han Zhi—a mistake born of an unexpected twist of fate. He does not truly exist, yet the moments that moved them were very real.
 

 
Being a fan is inherently both an illusory and very real experience.
 

 
Fans feel joy and pain for their idol's achievements and setbacks. A person who they will never have any real-life relationship with becomes one of the most intimate and important presences in their hearts, truly reaching the point of "Others laugh at me for being too crazy, I laugh at them for not seeing through it."
 

 
Girls have long been accustomed to what's fake.
 

 
The persona is crafted through marketing, and the face might be surgically enhanced.
 

 
It doesn't matter; their love is real—pure, passionate, and sincere.
 

 
To outsiders, stars are the moon, and fans are the sun.
 

 
When fans look at their idols, there is a light in their eyes.
 

 
Thus, these devoted followers lift them up to the pedestal, gilding them with a shining aura.
 

 
The ending of the behind-the-scenes video shows a Vlog that Han Zhi filmed after learning about his origin, unaffected by the identity card.
 

 
Accompanied by the sound of mechanical keyboard clicks, a line of text appears at the bottom:
 

 
[Room decor personally chosen by "Han Zhi"]
 

 
The show’s production team always treated Han Zhi as an independent person, respecting his will.
 

 
This small detail made his fans feel a bit better.
 

 
After all, just a few minutes ago, they believed they were fans of a living, breathing person.
 

 
The spacious room's layout is simple yet avoids a cold minimalist style. The colors are subtle and elegant, with small potted plants adding green touches. Han Zhi, sitting in an ergonomic chair, relaxedly adjusted the camera and gave a gentle smile to the screen: "Hello, I'm Han Zhi."
 

 
This smile was so familiar—it was the very smile that captivated them at first glance!
 

 
Han Zhi was wearing a linen-colored trench coat over a beige T-shirt and sweater, giving off a more casual, everyday vibe compared to his appearance on the show.
 

 
The indoor light fell on his handsome face, softening his sharp features.
 

 
"How should I put this?" he mused with a gentle smile. "I just found out that I'm actually a person without a past. All the background and identity I had in 'King of the Sea' were created by the show's scriptwriters."
 

 
These should have been heartbreaking words, yet Han Zhi's voice carried a thick sense of amusement, a bit of indifference and resignation. While others might see him as suffering, he didn't feel that way and even found it quite fun:
 

 
"Now my memory is completely empty—oh, except for the part that belongs to Tong Zhao. Actually, I think it’s quite nice. Compared to false memories, this clean and straightforward feeling is better. I don't need to possess too much."
 

 
It's hard to imagine that such a calm and composed "true self" could be hidden within Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
Some handsome guys look stunning when silent, but the moment they start expressing their views, you wish they were mute.
 

 
Han Zhi isn't that kind of handsome guy.
 

 
Fans, in fact, want to hear more from him.
 

 
Even when talking about big issues, he speaks with a calm and gentle tone. When describing trivial details, he does so with a soft charm and delight. One can imagine that if such a person truly existed, whether as a lover or a friend, he could make an ordinary, mundane life sparkle.
 

 
Recently, Han Zhi's rapid rise to fame has made his fanbase increasingly aggressive.
 

 
In some shady entertainment companies, this is a goldmine.
 

 
The younger and more irrational the fans are, the easier it is to exploit them for profit.
 

 
Once the "fan-pitting" game starts, there's no turning back.
 

 
Unless the idol themselves steps in to stop it.
 

 
But when the idol themselves is just a puppet controlled by capital, or if they seek to profit from it, why would they speak up? Or rather, those who sign contracts and become products at the end of the assembly line have already had their vocal cords removed.
 

 
However, Han Zhi has no such concerns.
 

 
He said, "In the real world, the only people I have a real connection with are probably you all, who have recently gathered around me because you like me. Fame comes quickly and goes quickly; soon, you will forget about me."
 

 
Han Zhi took off his glasses, his poetic eyes filled with a gentle, unspoken sentiment.
 

 
"However, I hope that in the short time you like me, you won't be affected by negative emotions."
 

 
"If you love me, then love purely."
 

 
"Don’t neglect your family, friends, studies, or life because of your fondness for me. I hope that through your feelings for me, you can draw positive energy... When you don’t feel like memorizing vocabulary, think of me. When you don’t feel like living anymore, think of how I would feel sad."
 

 
With his distinctly jointed hand, Han Zhi gently pulled open the collar of his coat, as if opening up his heart: "See, I am not a living person. I have unlimited time to love every person who loves me. How does that saying go? ‘Brother only has you.’ Yes, that's right. So, before you love me, love yourself a bit more."
 

 
He joked about his identity and revealed a smile as if he had thought of something pleasant.
 

 
When Han Zhi isn't smiling, that face is almost too perfect—so handsome it borders on cold.
 

 
But when he smiles, the glacier melts in an instant.
 

 
"If I can add a touch of color to your life, that would be an honor. I am very happy."
 

 
When the video ended, it automatically transitioned to the next one.
 

 
Only tearful fans were left behind.
# Chapter39
[I'm not sure why, but I’m a bit moved.]
 

 
[Mysterious emotion 1]
 

 
[Who says Brother Zhi is fake! I’m telling you to fuck off, he has consciousness and a soul, his own thoughts—why is he considered fake? At most, he's missing a bit of his spirit.]
 

 
This is the emotional response from fans.
 

 
...
 

 
The industry insiders and casual observers were stunned.
 

 
No one expected that a small influencer's drunk livestream could create such a big stir, like pulling up a carrot with all the dirt still attached, with each event escalating more than the last. It started as a replacement issue, then escalated to a huge privilege scandal...
 

 
But once the truth was revealed, Han Zhi is Tong Zhao!
 

 
It was originally a baffling twist, but the program's editing of this footage was done very well.
 

 
Fans are very emotional; they’re hard to deceive but easy to appease. Most who succeed in the entertainment industry by riding the wave of fandom culture usually understand how to comfort fans. Not to mention, after Han Zhi’s five-year reign as a top star, he transitioned to serious acting and moved away from idol work, yet his popularity remained undiminished. It’s not about the flow but surpasses it.
 

 
His Vlog was a genuine performance.
 

 
Outsiders see the spectacle and think he's just incredibly handsome and lucky, with female fans obsessed to the point of madness.
 

 
Insiders see the intricacies and wonder why this amateur understands fangirls so well. In hindsight, it's mostly Tong Zhao's influence.
 

 
To be charming and seductive but not too down-to-earth—becoming purely mundane.
 

 
Fangirls are willing to devote themselves to a celestial ideal, so a certain distance must be maintained to allow for fantasy... Mastering this balance is an art.
 

 
Teenagers usually don't understand this and rely on their agents to teach them.
 

 
Tong Zhao understands this.
 

 
But she doesn't flaunt it.
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi’s success, industry insiders are already discussing—
 

 
Xu Zhu, who debuted third in "Star Selection Girls," had just finished sweating it out in the dance practice room, exhausted. When she returned to her dorm and opened her computer, she was greeted with a flood of bad news. The water army she had deployed was confused, seeking instructions from their sponsor. As she scrolled through Weibo, the related phrases and lines of text burned into her retinas…
 

 
The first message was:
 

 
@Entertainment Affairs:
 

 
"If Tong Zhao were willing to participate in a girl group variety show, she would be a top C-position debutant, and Han Zhi is the best example!"
 

 
Xu Zhu gripped her mouse tightly, her palm sweating so much that it dampened it. She stared at the stream of Weibo posts and trending topics, unwilling to accept reality while desperately searching for more leaks, her face growing increasingly pale.
 

 
The overwhelming "good news" drowned her.
 

 
All praising Tong Zhao.
 

 
[Tong Zhao's subconscious is so diverse—how many more surprises does she have that we don't know about?]
 

 
[Suggest checking Tong Zhao's mental health/dog head. Generally, actors can't handle dual roles.]
 

 
[What does Han Zhi’s rise as a new traffic representative signify? It means Tong Zhao has the ability to attract a large number of male fans, but she doesn’t peddle romantic fantasies. I can’t help but fall for her fierce demeanor. Announcing my investment! (Secretly becoming Han Zhi’s female fan should go unnoticed, right?)]
 

 
...
 

 
The mouse was clicking furiously under Xu Zhu’s grip.
 

 
Her roommate quietly climbed into bed next to her, trying to lower their presence by covering their head with a blanket.
 

 
Finally, Xu Zhu, unable to bear it any longer, closed the entire Weibo page.
 

 
Since Tong Zhenming began mentoring her and she took the stage on "Star Selection Girl," Weibo has been her favorite and most frequently used app. She enjoyed searching her own name and seeing fans showering her with praise...
 

 
When did Xu Zhu stop wanting to open Weibo?
 

 
It was probably after the success of her role as the concubine in "The Ming Emperor's Chronicles."
 

 
Why was her stepsister always so much better and more impressive than she was? Why?
 

 
Why was her stepsister always able to reverse the situation from angles she couldn’t even imagine?
 

 
Xu Zhu really didn’t think she could bring her down this time; she just wanted to make her sick.
 

 
Being entangled with the female fans of a rising star felt like attracting flies, enough to annoy Tong Zhao for a while.
 

 
Now, thinking that Han Zhi is actually Tong Zhao...
 

 
The water army she had deployed ended up being the very wind that pushed Tong Zhao to even greater heights!
 

 
Is there anything more disgusting than this?
 

 
Her roommate, peeking out from under the blanket, saw Xu Zhu rush into the bathroom, followed by the sounds of intense vomiting and faint crying. The knot of jealousy trying to surpass Tong Zhao tightened, but it seemed like nothing she did could make a difference. She could only comfort herself by thinking that at least Tong Zhenming cared deeply about his reputation, and her stepsister had a stubborn personality. As long as the father and daughter didn’t reconcile, the Tong family’s assets would always belong to her brother.
 

 
The Tong family's business is still making money!
 

 
At worst, she could go back to being a rich young lady and marry Zhao Yi.
 

 
The money earned from the Ning-Tong family marriage would definitely be better than being just a star.
 

 
※
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber twice in a row, even Tong Zhao’s body was feeling the strain. She filled the bathtub with hot water and ginger-scented bath salts, immersed herself, and took a deep breath, finally feeling like she was coming back to life.
 

 
Just then, her manager, Chu Jie, called.
 

 
Tong Zhao put the phone on speaker and placed it by the bathtub.
 

 
As soon as the call connected, Chu Jie’s excited voice came through:
 

 
“You’ve done an amazing job! The industry is saying that your crisis management this time was divine. Out of a possible 100 points, you scored 150—50 extra points for Han Zhi. Have you checked Weibo? The comments are all from Han Zhi’s fans apologizing and declaring their love. They’re just hoping that you’ll occasionally perform as Han Zhi in the future. I think some programs could use this identity. Honestly…”
 

 
Chu Jie couldn't contain her laughter: "I've also received several offers for you to play male leads."
 

 
"Tong Zhao? Tong Zhao, are you listening?"
 

 
"Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle..."
 

 
Tong Zhao straightened up, lifting her head out of the water: "I’m listening."
 

 
Chu Jie ignored the strange water sounds and discussed the future direction with her.
 

 
Han Zhi's identity is a great selling point. If Tong Zhao doesn’t mind, it could indeed be used as a public persona, like a virtual streamer, without needing frequent appearances.
 

 
Of course, everything needs Tong Zhao's approval.
 

 
"Let me think about it."
 

 
Tong Zhao needed to consult with Han Zhi.
 

 
All personalities are essentially different versions of herself from different times and worlds. Just as a person’s thoughts change significantly from age three to sixteen to thirty-six, so too can the thoughts between different personalities vary.
 

 
To love others, one must first love oneself. Tong Zhao respects and cherishes her other personalities because they are reflections of her former selves.
 

 
Duan Ge: [So, Han Zhi is going to become a virtual idol?]
 

 
Duan Ge was curious.
 

 
After all, in her past life, due to the end-of-the-world scenario, she never enjoyed high technology. The most advanced technology she encountered was various high-damage weapons.
 

 
Chen Guifei: [I suspect that if I had first crossed over as Han Zhi and then gone to conquer the ancient world, not only would the dog emperor have been head over heels in love with me, but the harem of three thousand beauties would have fallen for me too.]
 

 
[Exaggerated.]
 

 
In the memory palace, Han Zhi's voice was a bit colder, but still gentle: [I can do that, but Zhao Zhao, you need to be clear. Although there’s no distinction between you and me, we both hope that when we return to our original world, we will be the most complete version of Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[I understand.]
 

 
Hearing Han Zhi’s agreement, Tong Zhao accepted Chu Jie’s proposal and let her handle the details.
 

 
It was previously mentioned that each personality is a partial and extreme version of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Only when they are all combined can she be considered complete.
 

 
So, they all hope that Tong Zhao won’t rely too much on any single personality.
 

 
However, decisions made by the primary personality are usually not opposed by the others.
 

 
After a while, Tong Zhao received another WeChat message from Chu Jie.
 

 
Chu Jie: [I forgot to mention, Han Zhi’s rise to fame has some artificial traces. Was it your advance purchase of Water Army? Although it was pretty low quality and quite noticeable, the result is good. Next time, let me handle such tasks, and you don’t need to worry about these things.]
 

 
...?
 

 
Tong Zhao nearly slipped and fell in the bathroom.
 

 
She repeatedly sent messages of confusion: "It wasn’t me, I didn’t do it, I don’t know."
 

 
Chu Jie told her to stop being modest.
 

 
Spending money in advance to hype up Han Zhi was a marketing strategy only someone like Tong Zhao could pull off.
 

 
Chu Jie: [But really, finding a water army requires spending money and finding the right channels. Don’t leave any traces. Next time, let me handle it. Otherwise, I’d be earning my salary for nothing.]
 

 
Tong Zhao denied it again, and this time Chu Jie believed her.
 

 
So, who was behind the water army?
 

 
After entering the holographic chamber, Tong Zhao felt as if she had stepped into another world. She carefully analyzed the shifts in online public opinion and identified a suspect who was both angry and amusing. She thought about it and decided to release Xu Zhu from her contact blacklist, thinking that even if she guessed wrong, it wouldn’t matter.
 

 
Surprisingly, the call went through.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s voice sounded cheerful: “Xu Zhu, water armies aren’t cheap, are they? It seems that Tong Zhenming really gave you a lot of money and connections.”
 

 
Xu Zhu on the other end of the phone did not respond immediately.
 

 
All Tong Zhao could hear was Xu Zhu's rapid breathing, and she was about ninety percent certain it was Xu Zhu's work.
 

 
"This really sounds like something Xu Zhu would do."
 

 
"Let me guess your thought process," Tong Zhao said cheerfully, pacing back and forth in the room provided by the production team. Her lips curled with a mischievous smile, as if she found amusement in analyzing her stepsister's behavior like playing with a cat or dog:
 

 
"You've been keeping an eye on me and noticed that the male guest spreading rumors about me attracted a bunch of impulsive, low-age fans. So you came up with a scheme to use others to attack me... Maybe 'attack' is too strong a word. You should know, this kind of drama won’t leave me without work; it might even help me maintain my topic's popularity. Four out of ten actresses on the market wouldn’t resist this kind of news, but you know me well enough to know I don’t like this kind of gossip."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but laugh, her clear laughter almost giving Xu Zhu a stroke:
 

 
"You spent money and hired a water army just to annoy me? Using the connections and financial power given to you by Tong Zhenming, you ended up turning me into a new rising star... Not everyone can achieve this, and it’s quite an accomplishment. I almost want to remove Tong Zhenming from the blacklist and have a word with him."
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao really thought it was a good idea.
 

 
If she could make Tong Zhenming so angry that he had a stroke, it would be a double victory!
 

 
Xu Zhu was on the verge of a stroke.
 

 
Upon hearing that her stepsister intended to take the issue to their father, Xu Zhu panicked: “You said you wouldn’t contact him again!”
 

 
“I regret it. How can I not share such good news with him?”
 

 
“I didn’t buy the water army; I didn’t do anything. Even if you’ve offended someone without realizing it, you can’t blame me for everything!”
 

 
Realizing the situation was going poorly, Xu Zhu thought her stepsister probably didn’t have concrete evidence.
 

 
As long as she denied everything, it would be fine.
 

 
Once she came to this conclusion, she felt much more relaxed. Just as she was putting her mind at ease, she heard dialing sounds on the other end of the phone…
 

 
With a beep, the call was connected.
 

 
Whose call was it?
 

 
While she was wondering, Xu Zhu heard a very familiar middle-aged male voice: “Who is this? If you don’t speak, I’ll hang up.”
 

 
Xu Zhu’s eyes widened in shock.
 

 
Tong Zhao actually had two phones and was making a call to her father on speakerphone!
 

 
This phone was the one Wei Zekai had reminded her to handle.
 

 
He said it was about separating public and private matters.
 

 
Then, using her new phone, he also added himself to her friends list.
 

 
Tong Zhao had given him a bemused look at the time and asked about the promised separation of public and private matters.
 

 
Wei Zekai had asserted with confidence that both professionally and personally, she should stay in touch with him.
 

 
“Tong Zhenming, it’s me,”
 

 
Thinking about Wei Zekai’s situation, Tong Zhao’s voice softened, carrying a hint of pleasant amusement.
 

 
“Hmph, you only come to me when you're in trouble? When things are fine, you don’t come around?” After recognizing his eldest daughter’s voice, Tong Zhenming sneered.
 

 
He didn’t know much about the entertainment industry.
 

 
What he had recently been exposed to were the comments from Han Zhi’s fans, which his youngest daughter had shown him, either intentionally or unintentionally.
 

 
Given Tong Zhenming’s understanding of his eldest daughter’s personality, she wouldn’t seek reconciliation unless she was truly trapped in a situation with no way out…
 

 
This understanding was still not deep enough.
 

 
After all, in her previous life, Tong Zhao never bowed her head to him, even if she were to sink into the mud.
# Chapter40
"Remember to share good news with your elders," Tong Zhao muttered while glancing at the second phone. The words "[Xu Zhu, in call]" on the screen filled her with immense satisfaction. This phone wasn't on speaker, so while she could hear Xu Zhu's faint cries, Tong Zhenmíng had no idea he was being used as a tool to mock his younger daughter, unknowingly starring in a comedy.
 

 
-- "Don't you think what you're doing is childish?"
 

 
-- "You've won. You've got everything. What more do you want? Enough! I'll apologize, alright? I was wrong!"
 

 
To prevent herself from slipping into depression one day, Tong Zhao had already pressed the record button.
 

 
She could give these two father-daughter audio clips to a professional to adjust and compose into a symphony. Imagine relaxing in a bath, eyes closed, savoring the music. It would certainly make her downtime more enjoyable.
 

 
Concubine Chen: "I like this idea."
 

 
The personas in her mind all praised her creativity.
 

 
In the ancient world, before concubine Chen had earned the title of consort, she had once been humiliated by a higher-ranking concubine, who had attempted to disfigure her with torture.
 

 
Although she didn’t suffer any real losses, the emperor, who had been infatuated and manipulated, was so appeased by Song Fei that he practically bent over backward for her. Later, Song Fei was demoted to a foot-washing maid by her side, and eventually banished to the Cold Palace. Everyone thought that the noble consort had long since avenged herself and should have moved on, forgetting all about Song. But not only did she not forget, she even had the emperor's personally bestowed opera troupe create a performance based on this humiliating incident. When bored, she'd have her maids feed her peeled fruit while she listened to the troupe perform.
 

 
It was like the ancient version of a song on repeat.
 

 
The noble consort never tired of hearing it.
 

 
Meanwhile, Song, in the Cold Palace, was so furious that she coughed up blood. The once-proud Lord Song, who had formally criticized Noble Consort Chen, lost all his face and reputation.
 

 
Some whispered that she was overly vindictive and petty, but this only made others more fearful of crossing her.
 

 
Two of life’s greatest joys are when your loved ones succeed and your enemies are left helplessly enraged.
 

 
"I'm currently filming a variety show," Tong Zhao began, her tone seemingly neutral but with a hint of sarcasm reaching its peak. "I'm so popular now that I have to disguise myself and wear a mask when I walk down the street. Half of the credit goes to your youngest daughter." Her words appeared polite, but the venom was unmistakable. "I won't go into detail because you wouldn't understand, but just search for 'Han Zhí' and 'Tong Zhao' online, and you'll see. She used your money and connections to buy a ton of fake accounts to smear me, but it backfired and ended up boosting my fame.”
 

 
"Impressive, Mr. Tong."
 

 
Her cold tone was laced with a hint of amusement, and the end of her sentence had a slight upward lilt.
 

 
Xu Zhu listened in utter despair.
 

 
She knew better than anyone what kind of person her father was and how much affection he really had for her—essentially none. To put it bluntly, even the real daughter raised by his side, Tong Zhao, had been harshly disciplined after daring to defy him following her mother's death. When Tong Zhao ran away from home, he didn’t bother looking for her, secretly hoping to see her fall hard and come back begging in humiliation. Xu Zhu had seen all this firsthand. While it had been satisfying to watch, it also filled her with a sense of dread. She constantly had to maintain a facade of obedience and sweetness in front of him, like a pet keeping up a flimsy father-daughter relationship.
 

 
Now, knowing his youngest daughter had spent his money and caused him to lose face in front of his eldest, what would Tong Zhenming do?
 

 
Just thinking about it made Xu Zhu’s eyes redden. Her fingertips trembled, and her voice rose in hysteria, "I didn’t! I didn’t do any of that!"
 

 
Mindful that she was still in the dorm, she couldn't say too much.
 

 
Her roommates pulled their blankets tighter, thinking the little princess of Star Select was having another episode.
 

 
Tong Zhenming's face darkened.
 

 
The more Xu Zhu desperately denied it, the more certain Tong Zhenmíng was that she was the one behind all the trouble. "Just check your daughter’s financial records, and you'll know. That's all I have to say, Mr. Tong, the philanthropist," she teased in a light, mocking tone before hanging up the phone and blocking him in one smooth motion.
 

 
She didn’t give her opponent any chance to respond.
 

 
After doing all this, she leisurely picked up the phone that was still connected to Xu Zhu. "Reporting behind someone’s back—I learned that trick from you. Turns out it works quite well."
 

 
In her past life, Tong Zhao only realized after falling out with Xu Zhu that every secret she had ever shared had been secretly told to her father, all to damage his opinion of her. They were nothing more than trivial teenage worries, but Tong Zhenming loved to assert his authority by disciplining his children. Controlling their secrets made him feel like the supreme ruler of the household.
 

 
It was just a typical flaw of authoritarian parents.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew that Tong Zhenming wouldn’t let Xu Zhu spend money freely. He likely kept an eye on every transaction she made. And she was certain that, true to his character, he would investigate.
 

 
Would Xu Zhu crumble and be abandoned by Tong Zhenming because of this?
 

 
Probably not.
 

 
But since Xu Zhu had gone out of her way to disgust her, Tong Zhao wasn’t just going to slap her back; she was going to make her feel equally sick.
 

 
"You damn..."
 

 
Just the thought of the incoming wrath from Tong Zhenming and the foreseeable punishment of having her allowance cut down made Xu Zhu's hands tremble, and her words crumbled in disarray.
 

 
The more panicked Xu Zhu became, the more calm and steady Tong Zhao felt.
 

 
She curled up a faint smile, "I'm the kind who holds grudges. You insult me once, and I'll slap you ten times harder. Xu Zhu, this is what you and your mother owe my mom. I'll remember it for the rest of my life. I don't mind wasting time on you, so never provoke me again."
 

 
Tong Zhao hung up the phone and promptly put her back on the blacklist.
 

 
Some people are naturally non-confrontational. Even when the other party is clearly at fault, they first reflect on themselves. After mustering up the courage to stand their ground, they still feel unsettled after the conflict. However, Tong Zhao was a different kind of person. She thoroughly enjoyed humiliating her enemies and drew immense motivation from it.
 

 
What positive self-help books don’t tell you is this: while words of encouragement from friends warm the heart momentarily, like a bowl of chicken soup for the soul, they soon fade. But the scorn and mockery from enemies often become the driving force that propels you out of bed every morning, and that motivation lasts a lot longer.
 

 
Your loving mom might tell you, "Do your best on this exam!”
 

 
The classmate who mocks your idol and steals your pen might say, "You're so obsessed with celebrities, you're definitely going to fail, haha."
 

 
Now, be honest, which one of these gives you more motivation to study?
 

 
After getting humiliated by Tong Zhao, Tong Zhenming indeed went to check the transaction records of Xu Zhu's secondary card.
 

 
Xu Zhu's connections all came from her father, so it was easy for him to inquire about his younger daughter's recent activities. When he asked his secretary about Tong Zhao's situation—despite knowing that the relationship between father and daughter wasn't good—the secretary braced himself and reported truthfully.
 

 
Upon discovering that the situation was exactly as Tong Zhao had said, Tong Zhenming's old face flushed red with both shame and anger.
 

 
Of course, he wasn’t going to reflect on why Tong Zhao had gone out of her way to mock him.
 

 
How could a patriarch ever be wrong?
 

 
In the Tong family, Tong Zhenming was the law and the truth.
 

 
When he was upset, someone had to suffer and get scolded.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao wasn't playing along with his usual tactics, the burden of his wrath fell on Xu Zhu, who had finally been accepted as his daughter.
 

 
Simply yelling over voice calls wasn’t satisfying enough for him, so Tong Zhenming dialed Xu Zhu on a video call.
 

 
When Xu Zhu received the call, she felt a chill run down her spine. Not daring to answer in her room, she rushed to the bathroom, turned on the faucet to ensure her roommates couldn’t hear clearly, and only then carefully pressed to answer the call.
 

 
"Where the hell were you? It took you so long to answer!"
 

 
The screen showed Tong Zhenming’s angry face. After seeing Xu Zhu's panicked apology, he let out a breath but immediately started yelling: "I wouldn't have known if I hadn't checked the transactions! You actually used my money to buy fake followers! Your sister used your stupidity to embarrass me. I'm spending money and effort, but not getting any appreciation! You and your mom must've been born to torment me..."
 

 
"I put you on a show, smoothed everything out, and gave you a stable debut. Do you even know how much talent you have? Look at your sister. I didn’t spend a single penny on her. I let her fend for herself, and look at where she is now. Ever since you were kids, I’ve given you and Tong Zhao the same resources, but neither your looks nor your grades ever matched hers."
 

 
"Your only advantage is that you’re obedient. I thought I could cultivate you since my older daughter turned out to be a disappointment. But no! I thought Tong Zhao was done for, but she’s bounced back. I don’t expect you to be as excellent as her, but at least don’t embarrass me."
 

 
"You got into trouble because you had too much money to spend. Your secondary card is now suspended. Once you’ve reflected on your mistakes, I’ll consider reinstating it."
 

 
Tong Zhenming took pleasure in using his financial control to punish his children. He added another threat: "If you really can’t make a name for yourself, then come back and get married."
 

 
His words hit Xu Zhu like a hammer, crushing her spirit. She didn’t even dare to plead with him because her father hated being talked back to. It wasn’t until the call ended that she wiped her face and realized she was covered in tears.
 

 
Xu Zhu was filled with resentment.
 

 
Before, Tong Zhao had been the center of attention in the family, and all she needed to do was drive a wedge between her stepsister and their father.
 

 
Now, Tong Zhao was no longer willing to tolerate it.
 

 
Her mother was pregnant with a younger brother, and Tong Zhenming had a thousand hopes pinned on this son. Because of the pregnancy, he couldn’t possibly get angry at her mother, leaving Xu Zhu as the only target in the family to vent on. His recent words were incredibly harsh, far more hurtful than her stepsister’s taunts—each one striking her sore spots a hundred times harder.
 

 
So, in her father’s eyes, she had always been the second choice.
 

 
Even though her stepsister had fallen out with the family...
 

 
Even though she had tried so hard, being obedient and eager to please her father...
 

 
She had thought that since her outdated father didn’t pay attention to the entertainment world, as long as she always reported good news and concealed the bad, she could keep up the illusion of her perfect image in his eyes.
 

 
But in the end, in Tong Zhenming’s eyes, she still wasn’t as good as Tong Zhao!
 

 
Xu Zhu bit down hard on her back teeth, her jaw clenched so tightly that it made a grinding sound. Her heart turned cold.
 

 
What Xu Zhu didn’t want to admit was that, at this moment, she really envied Tong Zhao.
 

 
Living under Tong Zhenming’s thumb was unbearable!
 

 
But what could she do?
 

 
She hated Tong Zhenming, but she hated Tong Zhao even more.
 

 
If Tong Zhao didn’t live well, then the position of Tong family’s heiress that Xu Zhu had lowered herself to claim would finally hold some meaning.
 

 
As the sound of running water from the faucet echoed, Xu Zhu’s delicate face gradually twisted in anger.
 

 
※
 

 
Due to the change of format for *King of the Sea* into a live broadcast, the shooting was postponed, giving the guests an extra day off.
 

 
He Shun tried to invite Tong Zhao to the cafeteria via WeChat for a meal, but after being flatly rejected, he received a sarcastic message:
 

 
【Actually, I think building something from scratch is more reliable than inheriting wealth. What do you think?】
 

 
Clearly, she was referring to Wei Zekai as a rival.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing and replied:
 

 
【I think starting a business doesn’t always succeed, but waiting to inherit an estate? That’s guaranteed.】
 

 
He Shun: 【…】
 

 
Just after sending the message, there was a knock on the door.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself, could he be coming to ask in person?
 

 
The male and female guests stayed on separate floors, but since they were adults and the place was filled with security cameras, there weren’t strict rules like a university dorm banning opposite genders from visiting. So far, no scandals had emerged. Tong Zhao cautiously looked through the peephole and froze—
 

 
Standing outside was none other than the "waiting-to-inherit" guy himself.
# Chapter41
As soon as Tong Zhao opened the door, Wei Zekai casually slipped inside.
 

 
He sniffed the air. "Smells nice. Did you spray perfume?"
 

 
"It’s probably the shampoo. I didn’t even put on body lotion."
 

 
It was then that Wei Zekai noticed her wet hair draped over her small shoulders. He stared at it thoughtfully for a moment before saying, "Let’s talk while you dry your hair. If you stay under the air conditioner with wet hair, you'll get a headache."
 

 
"Alright."
 

 
Tong Zhao sat on the sofa, plugged the hair dryer into the socket next to it, curious about what nonsense he might spout. She couldn't help but smile, thinking how his sniffing earlier reminded her of the little dog from the variety show. With a queen-like air, she tilted her chin toward him. "Go ahead."
 

 
Wei Zekai sat next to her, holding a stack of documents in his hands.
 

 
It turned out these were investment projects they had discussed before entering the variety show.
 

 
"This is the project for Zeshan Investments."
 

 
Before joining the show, Wei Zekai hadn’t been idle. He had been running around registering the company.
 

 
As for naming the company, his friends had put in a ridiculous amount of enthusiasm…
 

 
"Not Short on Cash Investment Company," "Throwing Money Away Investment Company," "Got Scammed Venture Capital Company," "Might as Well Run Away Investment Company"… There was even a suggestion to add all the members' names, but Tong Zhao asked if the employees would go mad when handling reimbursement invoices. Another second-generation suggested it didn’t matter since they had no employees, but when they found out the company seal couldn’t fit everything, this absurd idea was abandoned.
 

 
In the end, the name "Zeshan" was chosen, supposedly after consulting a Feng Shui master.
 

 
In reality, it was an abbreviation for "Wei Zekai, Charity Gambling King."
 

 
Of course, Wei Zekai didn’t know this.
 

 
Strictly speaking, Tong Zhao was no longer a wealthy second-generation. The funds she had were very limited. The major financial contributors in the small group were Wei Zekai and his friends, but the profit-sharing arrangement was that Tong Zhao would take half of the earnings, excluding the principal.
 

 
Because what to invest in and how to invest was decided by Tong Zhao.
 

 
She was considered to be contributing in terms of technical input.
 

 
In the small group without Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao, everyone had discussed that spending money recklessly was no problem. Investing with Wei would likely result in a loss, but only Tong Zhao could persuade him, and he only listened to her.
 

 
So, mastering the art of training dogs was also a skill.
 

 
"You’ve requested strong support for three specific apps, and after the funding was secured, their development speed has noticeably increased. Two of them have released beta versions, and I've sent you the installation packages. I think the 'Excellence Tutoring' app is quite good; it digitizes private tutoring into a one-on-one online format..."
 

 
Wei Zekai chattered on.
 

 
It was clear that he had genuinely spent time understanding the investment projects.
 

 
Investment isn’t just about putting money into a promising company and leaving it at that.
 

 
One must regularly send people to assess the results, ensuring that the money is being used effectively and not just wasted. Small companies' reports may be inflated with false data, and this is something Tong Zhao doesn’t have time to monitor. Coincidentally, this group of second-generation investors, including Wei Zekai, had received education in this area from their families.
 

 
They just lacked the vision and experience.
 

 
This made them excellent tools for Tong Zhao.
 

 
"I think we can provide some directional guidance," Tong Zhao interjected. "Since we’re at it, why not expand the scope? Is learning limited to just Chinese, English, math, and science? Why not include online guitar lessons, cooking... even towel weaving can be taught via video. The key is to recruit various talents; the tutors and the owners are both our clients and our products. Note this idea down and discuss it with them later."
 

 
As long as the money is sufficient and the equity share is high, investment companies can offer direction and even exercise dominant control over projects.
 

 
That’s why some independent studios, despite lacking funds, refuse investments—they fear being led astray by outsiders.
 

 
The app that Tong Zhao was interested in, "Excellence Tutoring," was the predecessor of the nationwide hit "Little Sheep Companion" app. It failed rapidly due to its focus on cloud-based private tutoring, and its creator, Boss Chen, faced a series of personal disasters: his startup failed, his marriage ended, and his elderly relatives died because they couldn't afford medical treatment. After his comeback, he often referenced Zhang Ailing's saying that success, when it comes too late, doesn’t feel the same.
 

 
The reason for the failure was simple.
 

 
The idea of tutoring was good, but Boss Chen overlooked that a mobile app in the eyes of students and parents is often just a tool for entertainment.
 

 
No matter how grand the name or how useful it may seem for learning, seeing students with a mobile phone often equates to them playing games. Moreover, very few people can focus on studying while holding a phone; most would end up opening "Honor of Kings" with a slight slip of the finger.
 

 
After realizing this, Boss Chen gritted his teeth and, with a hint of self-destructive determination, decided to target online gaming enthusiasts and shift to a companion app model. If that didn't work, he would just settle for working to pay off debts.
 

 
As a result, he inadvertently sparked a boom in the companion industry.
 

 
Tong Zhao saw its potential.
 

 
Actually, it would have been better to wait. If she had waited until the "Excellence Tutoring" app’s market feedback was harsh and Boss Chen’s funding chain broke, and if his elderly relatives fell ill again, Wei Zekai could have negotiated and potentially acquired it at a much lower price. However, Tong Zhao, who holds no grudges and appreciates Boss Chen’s tenacity, wouldn't be that ruthless.
 

 
The tenacity of not believing in evil, the kind that gets up and tries again after falling.
 

 
"You often play MOBA games, right? You've played Dota, LOL, and Honor of Kings. You're always complaining about your teammates being too bad and not cooperating. Why not just spend money to hire people to play with you? I want to create such a platform. I think this software is on a narrow path now; it needs to be expanded."
 

 
To ensure Wei Zekai understood, Tong Zhao specifically chose an example he was most familiar with.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s gaming style mirrored his own personality: a young man with top-notch skills. In the first ten minutes, he would excel across all three lanes, often trying to showcase his abilities to the point where he would get caught and killed by five opponents because no one could keep up with him. After such a rhythm break, he would start to fall apart…
 

 
"Got it."
 

 
Wei Zekai understood immediately and then continued discussing other matters.
 

 
The conversation lasted for several hours.
 

 
After drying out his mouth and finishing all the bottled water in the room, they agreed on which aspects of each investment needed follow-up and guidance. The project ideas were good, and the prospects were promising, but without practical business experience, it was necessary to hire relevant talent for guidance. Tong Zhao encouraged him, “You have plenty of talent at your place; just recruit a few to help.”
 

 
Wei Zekai agreed, heading back like a prince choosing his subordinates.
 

 
After resolving the business matters, Wei Zekai left efficiently.
 

 
Tong Zhao casually checked his recent gaming achievements. It had been a while since he last played, indicating that he was indeed very busy.
 

 
……
 

 
After discussing all night, the manager concluded that making one person earn two incomes was not feasible.
 

 
It was too exhausting for Tong Zhao.
 

 
The previous medical examination report, which showed an unclear area in Tong Zhao's brain scan, also worried Sister Chu. Although Han Zhi was a cash cow, the company did not want to exploit her to the point of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. If Han Zhi was marketed as a separate entity, fans on both sides would inevitably demand equal treatment. Any resources available to Tong Zhao would need to be available to Han Zhi as well.
 

 
So, the final conclusion was not to create a separate Weibo account for Han Zhi.
 

 
Do you like Han Zhi?
 

 
Fine, just confess and send flowers under Tong Zhao's Weibo.
 

 
The official stance was that the two were considered the same person, and Sister Chu passed this approach on to the major fan heads.
 

 
As long as it wasn't too outrageous, fans generally listened to fan heads.
 

 
Sometimes, the extent of their obedience made one wonder whether they were fans of the fan heads or the celebrities themselves.
 

 
The company's decision was swift and clear.
 

 
In no time, Tong Zhao gained a large number of female fans.
 

 
Thus, among the many young celebrities, the style of comments under Tong Zhao's Weibo was particularly unique:
 

 
[Humble fan begging for Brother Zhi to make an appearance]
 

 
[Zhao Zi, take care of your health too! It's really not easy to satisfy both sides of the fans. No matter which side, you are our treasure!]
 

 
[Hello, this comment is a gathering place for double-support fans/doge emoji]
 

 
Double-support fans always hold a lower status wherever they are.
 

 
After all, the fandom often has a bit of a binary mentality, valuing purity of stance.
 

 
If you like both, it means you don't like either.
 

 
But for Tong Zhao, "double-support fans" are the mainstream.
 

 
If you only like Tong Zhao, does that mean you can’t accept her more masculine side?
 

 
If you only like Han Zhi, then you’re even more fickle; the brother you like is not even the complete package!
 

 
Damn.
 

 
Fans are easily swayed by their emotions. If you say they don’t really like the brother, they’re more eager than anyone. This passionate, selfless emotion that doesn’t consider future gains has been forcibly sustained as a trickle with Tong Zhao…
 

 
After all, Tong Zhao doesn’t have any albums to push for sales.
 

 
She doesn’t have any endorsements yet.
 

 
Fans are more impatient than she is, and some even went to the company’s Weibo to complain:
 

 
"Sister Zhao’s popularity has been so high recently, why not seize the opportunity to promote more?"
 

 
"What about endorsements? Get them lined up! Do we need to teach you?"
 

 
"I urge you to be kind; don’t ignore her treatment just because Sister is low-key and doesn’t fight for herself. We are her support; we will fight for her!"
 

 
Passionate fans attacking fellow allies, delivering a crushing blow with a critical hit of 999.
 

 
The company was both amused and helpless, quickly explaining that Tong Zhao would soon have a secondary line of luxury brand perfume endorsements. However, because Han Zhi’s unexpected rise in popularity, the brand hoped to incorporate Han Zhi's image into the endorsement promotion, which delayed the progress.
 

 
This explanation met the fans' needs perfectly.
 

 
The comments that had just viciously criticized the company suddenly turned into a spring breeze, causing the PR team to breathe a sigh of relief and marvel at how realistic things were.
 

 
Tong Zhao found it amusing, while other actresses with similar positioning to hers could not find the humor in it.
 

 
Except for those who could avoid the spotlight with a sweet and soft loli persona, other actresses in the same period were urging their managers to schedule their slots before Tong Zhao finished filming her variety show, to avoid competing with her—something they couldn’t win. Some young male stars’ managers were even inquiring with Sister Chu to find out if Tong Zhao had any intention of cross-dressing in roles meant for male stars.
 

 
Sigh, women have to be wary, and men have to be wary of her too.
 

 
This woman, why is she so annoying?
 

 
Disliking a peer is useless; it’s the fans and the audience who watch her.
 

 
Even so, before "Sea King Killer" even premiered, the number of viewers was poised to break new records, maintaining its momentum at the platinum level. Moreover, 70% of the audience was drawn to Tong Zhao, turning what was supposed to be a multi-person variety show into something like a solo performance.
 

 
Fortunately, most of the guests were ordinary people. If it relied on fellow stars who thrive on popularity, they would have laughed until they cried.
 

 
There were even idle netizens suggesting that Tong Zhao’s “true self” is so varied that perhaps a show could be made to explore how many facets of her subconscious could be revealed.
 

 
This suggestion was immediately drowned out by the spittle of fans and conscientious netizens.
 

 
[Got it, Tong Zhao is the Voldemort of the film industry, arrange for seven Horcruxes.]
 

 
[Impossible, the consciousness would be confused, and just performing alongside Han Zhi already drains Zhao Zhao’s energy. Drag out those who make such ridiculous suggestions and lock them up.]
 

 
Fans were quite worried.
 

 
To them, Tong Zhao was too challenging.
 

 
In the variety show, where she played two roles, the director had no hope that she would agree. Yet, not only did she agree, but she did so enthusiastically. While her fans were proud of her, they were also worried that she might not take care of her health. A netizen who was being attacked was anxious and said, [Tong Zhao's unique subconscious type is a gold mine. Protecting her is useless; the company won’t leave a gold mine untapped.]
 

 
Her manager, Sister Chu, was quite speechless and specifically advised her, “Don’t take what netizens say seriously. The company seeks profit, not harm. We’re not digging for gold; we’re taking care of the artist’s well-being.”
 

 
“Thank you, Sister Chu.”
 

 
Tong Zhao gave a sweet smile.
 

 
She then turned to discuss with others, “I think this idea is good. Once we have the funds, let’s invest in it ourselves. It could be like an offline meeting. I’ve even thought of a name for the show: ‘A Loving Family.’”
 

 
Concubine Shen: [Help, that sounds so tacky.]
 

 
Female Reporter: [Tacky 1]
 

 
Duan Ge: [I think it’s okay? Whatever, how about ‘Psychotic Thinking World,’ and Kai can go next door to ‘Happy Idiot Children’] She had a particular fondness for the foolish and adorable Wei Zekai.
 

 
Han Zhi also thought it sounded tacky.
 

 
However, his principle was not to criticize women unless necessary, so he listened quietly as they discussed.
 

 
Amid the laughter and the ever-increasing wave of audience, Tong Zhao lay down in the holographic shooting chamber, trying to clear her mind and make way for Han Zhi and Concubine Chen.
 

 
Probably accustomed to the dull and boring life in the palace, Concubine Chen particularly enjoyed being in the spotlight.
 

 
For such performance opportunities, she was more proactive than the other personalities.
 

 
As the machinery began to force her into a deep sleep, Concubine Chen raised her eyebrows and looked over.
 

 
In the memory palace, each personality maintained the image they cherished most in life. She was dressed in the concubine's imperial robe, the red gown with gold threads shimmering in waves as she took graceful steps, bold and dazzling. In the palace, one must first honor the clothes before honoring the person. Regardless of what others thought, everyone who saw Concubine Chen had to kneel first.
 

 
“So…” she slowly opened the topic, “our task later is to flirt with each other?”
 

 
“Our memories have all been restored,” Han Zhi reminded her.
 

 
That’s right, all the personalities remembered how passionately they had kissed.
 

 
Her question was essentially pointless.
 

 
“You should be careful; I can be very unscrupulous to win a man's heart.”
 

 
Concubine Chen snorted, her face lifting into a charming smile.
 

 
As her body gradually fell into a deep sleep under the influence of the machinery, the lights in the memory palace began to dim, casting Han Zhi’s gentle and handsome face into deep shadows, like a dangerous creature lurking in the dark depths of the sea.
 

 
“Fair point, I’ll be cautious.”
 

 
He accepted the reminder with a kind-hearted demeanor, gently holding Concubine Chen’s cool and soft hand.
 

 
The entire hall fell silently into darkness…
 

 
*
 

 
The program was already being broadcast live.
 

 
The director was adept at teasing the audience's emotions, first focusing the camera on several ordinary audience members, with an unusually long stay on Wei Zekai. Han Zhi was excluded from the "Sea King" category by Wei Zekai, making He Shun a prime suspect for that role, so the camera lingered on He Shun.
 

 
[Alert dog.jpg]
 

 
[Wei Zekai has ruled out one correct answer!]
 

 
[Want to see Brother Zhi, show him more on camera, please!]
 

 
As they spoke, many of Han Zhi's fans eagerly spent money, donning golden name tags in support of him in the live stream chat.
 

 
...
 

 
Just like in "The Truman Show," the guests were unaware that every move they made was being observed.
 

 
Han Zhi remained very composed.
 

 
Despite having a "bad boy" backstory in his character setting, he didn’t seem in a rush to pursue the girls, keeping a relaxed distance from them.
 

 
He sat on a sofa in the corner, stretching his long legs. The sunlight highlighted his profile with a golden edge, making him appear almost unreal. Fans naturally took a flurry of screenshots; unable to see their idol in real life on a schedule, they had to preserve these moments as best as they could.
 

 
Not only was Han Zhi calm, but Tong Zhao also appeared disinterested in him.
 

 
It was as if the previously passionate kissing scenes were merely the audience's one-sided imagination.
 

 
[I don’t know why, but even if they do nothing, just being in the same frame makes me feel a certain way.]
 

 
[Damn, fellow traveler.]
 

 
[Does this count as "bone science"?]
 

 
[Same person, guess it's "narcissus," self-inflicted, I flirt with myself!]
 

 
The barrage of comments was lively, though nothing much happened.
 

 
After the director emphasized the underlying tension, the focus shifted to the actual events of the day. Filming was like dreaming, with the duration determined by the brain's ebb and flow. In ordinary dreams, people often find themselves sitting at a table eating a fried egg, only to wake up and realize seven hours have passed, and it's time to go to work or school.
 

 
After He Shun, holding a teacher’s ID card, tutored Tong Zhao for two sessions, she stretched her back.
 

 
“So tired.”
 

 
The director expertly focused the camera on her.
 

 
As the young girl's slender, white arms stretched out, her waist, barely more than a handful, was also revealed on camera.
 

 
At that moment, the audience was immersed in He Shun's perspective.
 

 
Even female viewers could completely understand why this man would be captivated.
 

 
Who could resist such a stunning visual?
 

 
He Shun, overwhelmed by the breathtaking sight, was no exception.
 

 
He took the cue and said, “We've been studying all afternoon; it’s better to combine work with relaxation. How about going for a walk together?”
 

 
Due to Tong Zhao's request, their tutoring didn’t take place in the study room but rather in the living room where everyone could see them, and they spoke in low tones. From He Shun’s inner thoughts, the audience knew he had been trying to find ways to be alone with her, yet he was afraid of appearing too obvious and scaring the timid girl.
 

 
Of course, from the god’s eye view, the audience also knew...
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I'm getting a bit tired of the lessons. When should I make my move?]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Let’s do it today. Give him a chance to seize it.]
 

 
In her inner thoughts, Tong Zhao was always lazy, her voice charmingly aloof.
 

 
The Empress Dowager was very proactive.
 

 
But her proactiveness meant graciously giving men the chance to pursue her.
 

 
She was the gatekeeper, the one who set the rules of the game.
 

 
The only reason one could win in this game named "Empress Dowager" was that she was willing to.
 

 
Watching the Empress Dowager flirt on livestream was thrilling.
 

 
Many people lamented that it would be entertaining if "The Chronicle of Ming Emperor" also broadcast Tong Zhao's psychological activities in high intensity, with one fan writing a heartfelt plea for Tong Zhao to star in a palace drama!
 

 
Seeing He Shun respond, Tong Zhao nodded with pleasure, "Sure."
 

 
She looked up at him, her eyes moist and full of reliance and a touch of admiration for the man.
 

 
Admiration with eyes full of starlight was one thing.
 

 
What was crucial was that she even pretended to work hard to hide her admiration, directly hitting the man’s soft spot.
 

 
Originally struck by the revelation that their goddess had a man in her mind, Tong Zhao's male fans were reignited with hope at this glance.
 

 
[If my wife looks at me like this, I won't be able to control myself.]
 

 
[Those who can't accept Han Zhi's male fans have no right to call her 'wife'! Zhao Bao, I'm bisexual—consider me?]
 

 
[I envy this ordinary guest so much. Any ordinary man would consider a lifetime worthwhile just to be flirted with by such a stunning beauty.]
 

 
[Exactly, being flirted with by her really leaves a lasting impression…]
 

 
This melancholic comment immediately attracted ridicule from others, mocking the commenter as if he had truly been flirted with by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Feeling his conscience, does he even deserve it?
 

 
Song Wanzhuo, who was being questioned, felt a bit suffocated.
 

 
This time, he was quite smart about pursuing his star, no longer mentioning it much on Weibo. Otherwise, his handsome and charming image would soon be reduced to that of a dog emperor. Dogs weren’t the problem; it actually proved that he played the role of Ming Emperor well, as the audience remembered him.
 

 
How many roles in an actor's lifetime can leave such a deep impression on the audience?
 

 
The issue was that ever since Tong Zhao’s various provocative actions, his "dog emperor" title now had an additional prefix—
 

 
Wearing a green hat.
 

 
Song Wanzhuo was furious!
 

 
While fuming, he took two close-up shots of Tong Zhao.
 

 
Oh, Zhao Zhao, my wife is truly beautiful.
 

 
He Shun thought the same.
 

 
In addition to the large duplex villa, the estate also had a garden with small bridges and flowing water, providing plenty of private space for the guests. With such an excessively large garden, it was really hard for these six people to run into each other.
 

 
The backstage narrator timely reminded that He Shun had actually sneaked in to scout the place before.
 

 
[Damn, what does he want to do to my wife!]
 

 
[Don’t worry, any inappropriate thoughts will be detected by the intelligent AI, and the scenes you gents are hoping for won’t appear.]
 

 
He Shun really didn’t have any such intentions.
 

 
He just wanted to maintain his omnipotent, authoritative image in Tong Zhao’s eyes.
 

 
“I remember you’re very interested in biology,” He Shun said lightly, following Tong Zhao’s gaze and offering a brief lesson: “Here we have koi from the royal three families. Look at this one; its red markings on the head are particularly large, and the small round red spots on its mouth are like lipstick. This one is a golden and silver-scaled red and white koi…”
 

 
When He Shun mentioned lipstick, his gaze inevitably fell on Tong Zhao's full, slightly pouting lips.
 

 
He thought, [Even though she isn’t wearing lipstick, her lips are still so rosy. She’s just too beautiful.]
 

 
The bullet comments were merciless:
 

 
[She’s wearing lipstick, straight men need to get their eyes checked.]
 

 
However, Tong Zhao’s inner thoughts were even more ruthless:
 

 
[Hmm, listening to him ramble on, he must have done his homework beforehand. He really wants to show off in front of me.]
 

 
[Alright, alright, he’s quite diligent. I’ll indulge him a bit.]
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice remained lazily indifferent.
 

 
It was as if she was playing a cliché game she had already mastered countless times, with the boss and attack patterns so familiar that she felt a bit disinterested.
 

 
With that in mind, Tong Zhao looked up at him with a smile, her eyes sparkling like a little dog: “Mr. He, you know so much.”
# Chapter42
A gentle breeze rippled across the pond.
 

 
When He Shun lowered his head, he met Tong Zhao’s gaze, which sparkled like stars.
 

 
This unprecedentedly inflated his confidence.
 

 
When a man is attracted to a woman, the most obvious behavior isn’t necessarily being nice to her, as some men tend to hold back a bit. The clearest signal is when he deliberately shows off his strengths to catch her attention. It could be his work abilities, his talent and thoughtfulness, his willingness to spend time with her, or even more, revealing his past romantic experiences. It’s like saying, “Look! I’m such a devoted, kind-hearted guy. Now, aren’t you going to get in bed with me?”
 

 
"It’s just something I happen to know," He Shun restrained himself with the last bit of rationality he had left, avoiding further showing off. "You don’t have to call me ‘teacher.’ You can just use my name. After all, I didn’t call you ‘Student Tong,’ did I?"
 

 
Tong Zhao’s inner voice: 【...Ugh, this is so cheesy.】
 

 
Contrary to her dismissive inner thoughts, she smiled gently, her white dress swaying in the wind, creating soft, layered ripples—fulfilling every man’s fantasy of the sweet childhood crush.
 

 
When the audience thought she would follow through with the sweet tactic and call him “Brother He” in a soft voice, she instead let her smile fade slightly: "Since you’re tutoring me, calling you by your full name feels a bit disrespectful."
 

 
He Shun, Brother He, Ah Shun...
 

 
No matter how she addressed him, as long as it came from Tong Zhao’s lips, He Shun wanted to hear it. Yet at this moment, Tong Zhao seemed completely oblivious to his hint.
 

 
He Shun immediately became a bit anxious: "I’ve never felt disrespected by you."
 

 
As he rushed to express his loyalty, the composed demeanor he had earlier crumbled like sand blown away by the wind.
 

 
[You want me to change how I address you without showing any sincerity? You're too greedy, Little He.] Tong Zhao's haughty inner voice revealed to the audience what was really going on.
 

 
So, the noble consort was displeased!
 

 
The live chat marveled at her skill, acknowledging that a true expert was at work.
 

 
He Shun was the typical successful, elite man—used to taking charge in relationships, often finding fault with others. However, in front of Tong Zhao, his psychological shifts were entirely under her control. Every advance and retreat was dictated by her.
 

 
A VIP viewer posted a meme from *Tom and Jerry*, capturing a melancholic Tom with the caption: "[Poor Tom, being played in the palm of her hand.jpg]". It was instantly upvoted to 999 by the live-stream audience.
 

 
It was spot on!
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t respond verbally, only giving him a slightly puzzled look.
 

 
【This is baiting.】
 

 
【Men are natural hunters. He Shun has already invested so much time and emotional energy in me, and I'm clearly the best "stock" among the three options. He needs to see a little hope of growth—the current stagnation is just because he hasn't invested enough yet...】
 

 
【I need to make him believe that if he invests a bit more and performs better, he’ll get a return with interest on everything he's put in.】
 

 
Tong Zhao’s cold and calculating inner thoughts stood in stark contrast to her gentle and sweet exterior.
 

 
In her mind, emotions were reduced to stocks, and He Shun was merely an investor.
 

 
It seemed like the one making the choices was the investor, but in reality, there’s always someone behind the scenes—the operator.
 

 
Some of the comments, clearly from male viewers, had already started criticizing her, calling her a bad woman.
 

 
But many more found her intriguing.
 

 
“I don’t just want to be your teacher.” Picking up on her signals, He Shun immediately raised the stakes.
 

 
The audience collectively gasped.
 

 
He Shun softened his tone: “As a teacher, the relationship ends once the lessons are over, right? I don’t want that to happen.”
 

 
The audience was stunned.
 

 
[That’s it? That’s it? That’s it?]
 

 
[You chickened out right at the finish line?]
 

 
[We gave you the chance, and you blew it, Little He!]
 

 
Some viewers had already forgotten about He Shun's impressive credentials and high social status, which placed him in the top 80% of men in real life, and they began mimicking Tong Zhao’s tone, calling him "Little He."
 

 
Tong Zhao’s smile faded, becoming almost nonexistent.
 

 
She had a face that held up under scrutiny, a real beauty.
 

 
This was quite different from the sweet, girl-next-door type. When she smiled, it was pure and soft, but when she didn’t, there was a noticeable distance. It felt as though—
 

 
If he didn’t raise the stakes and show more sincerity, he was about to miss his chance to invest in her.
 

 
“Tong Zhao…” he called her.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao curled her lips slightly, her tone sounding annoyed: "I don't need more friends."
 

 
The two of them stood by the pond, leaning against the bridge railing, as the wind blew through the girl’s long, curly hair, momentarily blinding He Shun.
 

 
He Shun desperately analyzed the information hidden in her words.
 

 
Tong Zhao lightly bit the inside of her cheek, using the pain to stifle her laughter, making her look even more irritated.
 

 
Although Tong Zhao didn’t explicitly say it, her signals were clear. He Shun had a sudden realization: “Of course, Tong Zhao admires me so much. She must be feeling insecure inside and really needs my reassurance and protection... I’m a grown man—should I really wait for a young girl to take the initiative? That wouldn’t be right. Ah, I just can’t help but spoil her.”
 

 
This delusional inner monologue from He Shun, full of affectionate indulgence, immediately struck the audience, who had a godlike perspective, as hilarious.
 

 
[This is the charm of a regular person—unintentionally funny?]
 

 
[I bet this is exactly what Emperor Ming thought back then—‘Oh, my poor concubine! She can only rely on my brilliant and mighty self. Look at how much she adores me. I must protect this sweet, innocent girl.’]
 

 
[...]
 

 
No need to wonder, that last comment was sent by Song Wanzhuo, whose pride had taken another hit.
 

 
“Stop roasting me already! If this keeps up, I’ll be a fool,” Song Wanzhuo thought.
 

 
Unconvinced, Song Wanzhuo decided to turn off the holographic viewing mode and switch to a traditional viewing perspective. At the same time, he opened a document, intending to write an essay reflecting on Emperor Ming’s inner thoughts. He was convinced that he and that fool He Shun were nothing alike. He had to set the record straight, refusing to let the goofy netizens continue twisting the narrative.
 

 
He Shun was an outsider to the entertainment industry, so no matter how much people compared him to Song Wanzhuo, it wouldn’t affect Song’s popularity. Because of this, Song's fans found such comments amusing and didn’t bother to stop them, even enjoying the opportunity to create an image of Song’s fanbase as well-mannered and respectful, not harassing others.
 

 
His model friend, Ling Zisheng, lit a cigarette, glancing at him: “Why are you even writing this? There's no need to clarify anything. No matter how much this outsider tries to ride your coattails, it won’t affect you.”
 

 
“I know,”
 

 
Song Wanzhuo replied, typing away without looking up: “But what if *Baobei* sees it and mistakes me for being like that idiot?”
 

 
“Who’s *Baobei*? Do you have a girlfriend and you’re not telling your bro?”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, puzzled, lowered his head to light his cigarette.
 

 
“Zhaobao, of course.”
 

 
As he spoke, Song Wanzhuo quickly captured two close-up shots of Tong Zhao's beautiful face.
 

 
“...”
 

 
Ling Zisheng, known for his calm and cool persona, shuddered at the response, nearly burning his fingers with the lighter.
 

 
Ling Zisheng started thinking maybe their agent had a point. The biggest threat to Song Wanzhuo’s public image wasn’t having a girlfriend—it was this childhood friend of his.
 

 
At that moment, in *King of the Sea*, He Shun finally summoned the courage to say the key words: "So, do you need a boyfriend?”
 

 
Under the camera, his attempt to act relaxed was seen through clearly by the audience.
 

 
At this moment, his previous "straight man syndrome" and macho attitude didn’t seem as off-putting, and the viewers began lighting metaphorical candles for him.
 

 
["Poor He Shun, getting played like a puppet in her hands."]
 

 
["I love Sister Zhao's bad girl energy so much, please crank it up!"]
 

 
The "bad woman" Tong Zhao stepped back upon hearing this, her face flushed.
 

 
What the heck!
 

 
How was this possible? How could this woman blush on command?
 

 
The audience was utterly confused, but somehow, she just had that skill.
 

 
Tong Zhao also bruised easily, though the marks faded quickly.
 

 
"Are you confessing to me?" At this moment, Tong Zhao's earlier calm and aloof demeanor was nowhere to be found. Her sweet voice trembled slightly, and she awkwardly averted her gaze with a shy, embarrassed look: "You're older than me, more mature, you know so much, and I've never been in a relationship before. If you're just looking to play around..."
 

 
Tong Zhao's inner voice was lively: *"Then you’ve definitely found the right person!"*
 

 
Of course, she didn’t say that out loud.
 

 
Her eyes were welling up with tears, holding back her laughter.
 

 
She had to stifle her laughter as she pushed He Shun to the edge of a cliff with her flattery.
 

 
All the guests knew the rules of the game in *King of the Seas*. You could talk however you liked, but most wouldn’t register their "crush" on the app. Just like in real life, very few people would hand over their paycheck or add someone to the house deed while still dating.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were the one to bring it up first, it might trigger He Shun's suspicion or wariness.
 

 
The essence of romantic relationships is an exchange of benefits. These benefits could be appearance, companionship, money, loyalty, or even the promise of marriage.
 

 
To leverage something small into something bigger, you must use psychological tactics to create an illusion for the other party.
 

 
Why are so many women willing to act as free housekeepers before marriage? It’s because these men often give out a "promise of marriage" in exchange for actual domestic labor, claiming, "I’m working hard for *our* future happiness." But if you think about it, a promise of marriage before actually tying the knot is just empty talk. Would a man stop working hard if he didn’t have a girlfriend? Of course not—it’s nonsense, pure deception, with bad intentions.
 

 
At this moment, Tong Zhao was exactly that kind of bad woman with bad intentions.
 

 
So, she had to keep pressing forward, step by step.
 

 
Step by step, He Shun unconsciously added more to the pot.
 

 
While pushing him to make a statement, Tong Zhao used compliments to make him believe he was the one holding all the cards, the one in control.
 

 
[--This was a trap carefully crafted after understanding He Shun's personality weaknesses.]
 

 
With Tong Zhao's calm inner voice, He Shun interrupted her self-deprecating remarks: "I’m serious. You don’t need to give me an answer right now, but I can show you my sincerity."
 

 
Saying that, He Shun took out his phone.
 

 
Under the watchful eyes of millions of viewers, he opened the official app for signaling romantic interest. After a brief loading screen, he selected Tong Zhao without a moment's hesitation and firmly pressed confirm.
 

 
As soon as He Shun pressed the button, the screen changed: “Congratulations, player! You've found your match!”
 

 
The cheesy fireworks and clapping sound effects added a bit of humor to the historic moment.
 

 
He Shun felt he was embodying the responsibility and grace of a mature man.
 

 
The chat was stunned.
 

 
[Did he really just give in that easily?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao didn’t really seem to do much, yet it feels like she did everything…]
 

 
[Boyfriend fans, it's time to back off. We can't keep up with her. Isn't just being a pure looks fan or career fan enough?]
 

 
Some fans of Han Zhi jokingly commented in the livestream:
 

 
"[Oh no, oh no, Zhao Zhao scores the first point, Zhi Ge is falling behind!]"
 
"[I’m willing to fill Zhi Ge's fish pond.]"
 
"[Go for it, Zhi Ge!]"
 

 
While banter flew outside the show, real emotions of love and jealousy were unfolding within.
 

 
[...Ah, level cleared.]
 

 
The audience could easily sense the boredom in Tong Zhao’s inner voice.
 

 
However, on her face, she graciously displayed a touched expression. She played her part well, acting as if she was deeply moved by being chosen so decisively for the first time, almost as if He Shun were her savior. But, since it was her first experience, she couldn’t quickly give him an answer...
 

 
Then she added a shy smile.
 

 
To a man, it looked like the bashfulness of a girl experiencing her first love, and naturally, he wouldn’t push her for a response.
 

 
This is the advantage of showing weakness in relationships.
 

 
Outwardly weak, but inwardly strong.
 

 
It leaves the other person with no choice but to feel morally obligated!
 

 
[I wonder when he’ll realize I never actually accepted his pursuit?]
 

 
[Oh well, it doesn’t matter.]
 

 
[Let’s see who I’ll play with next.]
 

 
As Tong Zhao thought this, she and He Shun strolled around the garden for a while.
 

 
What neither they nor the audience noticed was that a fluffy little dog was hiding behind the bushes, observing them in secret...
 

 
When the director switched the camera, the audience realized that Wei Zekai was dutifully performing his role as a judge, keeping an eye on the "bad guy"! Although the distance was quite far, Wei Zekai, now a dog, had excellent hearing and could clearly hear their conversation.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Hmm, I can hear their conversation very clearly.]
 

 
The audience was alarmed—Tong Zhao was in danger!
 

 
It's normal for He Shun to be swayed by novelty and have reduced judgment due to infatuation. This can be understood.
 

 
In love, the observers are always clearer.
 

 
With a bit of romantic experience, one can step back and observe the two of them to see that there were details about Tong Zhao that seemed off.
 

 
Wei Ke: [Tong Zhao really is a...]
 

 
[Femme fatale! Femme fatale! Femme fatale!]
 

 
[Sea King! Sea King! Sea King!]
 

 
[There’s only one truth—]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s doggy eyes looked admiringly at her departing figure: [...a girl who takes relationships seriously and is pure!]
 

 
......
 

 
.........
 

 
[It’s hopeless, both Wei Zekai and I who had expectations for him are doomed.]
 

 
[For the sake of the show, why not set up a bet on how long it will take for the princess to win him over?]
 

 
[I'm reasonably suspicious that Wei Zekai is still a virgin.]
 

 
[Virgin 1]
 

 
[I want to keep following this pair!]
 

 
Wei Zekai clenched its pink paw pads and wagged its little tail.
 

 
※
 

 
The events in the garden were known to no one other than Wei Zekai.
 

 
He was aware that he didn’t get along well with the other two girls, and Wei Zekai seemed too aloof and immature, so when he was bored, he mostly chatted with Han Zhi. Interestingly, although he initially looked down on Han Zhi for being too good-looking, he found him to be quite pleasant and a good company.
 

 
However, from the audience's god's-eye view, Han Zhi showed no interest in chatting with men.
 

 
[So boring, can you not corner me into talking?]
 

 
Han Zhi’s thoughts were very cold, lacking the gentle patience he had when speaking with girls.
 

 
He felt he could converse well with Han Zhi...
 

 
Only because of the emotional intelligence gap, he was under the illusion that they had a lot in common, but it was really just that Han Zhi was playing along.
 

 
Without much thought, He Shun asked, “It looks like you must get confessed to by girls often.”
 

 
Han Zhi was taken aback, not expecting such a personal question, and replied with a smile, “Not really, saying ‘often’ is an exaggeration.”
 

 
He Shun looked at him with a somewhat envious and dismissive gaze.
 

 
Who doesn’t want to be a popular man?
 

 
However, he already had the best one, and thinking about Tong Zhao's appearance, he spoke with a hint of superiority: "Anyway, it's definitely more than I have."
 

 
Han Zhi responded with a simple “Hmm?” and let him continue performing on stage.
 

 
Han Zhi: [This guy’s desire to perform is overflowing the screen... Should I start charging for this chat?]
 

 
The audience couldn't help but laugh.
 

 
Since learning that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were the same person, they began to see their common traits.
 

 
One of those traits was a somewhat harsh sense of humor.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t hide his amusement in his voice: “I prefer to take the initiative. Women are shy and like to play hard to get; there's nothing we can do about them, so we men have to be more proactive.”
 

 
Han Zhi smiled and deflected the conversation, thinking to himself: [He seems excited; he must have been won over by Tong Zhao.]
 

 
The roles in their interactions were quite clear; he understood them well.
 

 
[That seemingly perfect girl, could she actually be interested in He Shun?]
 

 
Han Zhi subtly glanced at the open door on the second floor.
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t often come to public spaces and maintained a vague distance from everyone, adding to her air of mystery.
 

 
[It seems we've tacitly put each other at the bottom of the list.]
 

 
The audience sighed as they listened.
 

 
It seems we won’t be seeing any high-level matches for now!
 

 
We’ll have to settle for watching the low-level games and how they maintain their daily routines.
 

 
For the daily surprise tasks, it seemed that the production team intentionally mixed up the players' teams to create more excitement. Zhong Muxi drew He Shun, Chang Xiaonian ended up with the very cautious and handsome Han Zhi, leaving Tong Zhao and Wei Zekai as a pair.
 

 
The male side decides on the activities to build friendship, with restrictions against anything explicit or offensive.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a good impression of the innocent girl in his mind and took off his game headset: “Do you play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “...What games?”
 

 
Wei Zekai: “Honor of Kings.”
 

 
……
 

 
Wearing a white dress with an ethereal, otherworldly beauty, Tong Zhao gave him a very tolerant smile and told herself: [The task content is here, there’s money to be made, cater to their interests, cater to their interests...]
 

 
So, they went to the gaming room to play ranked matches.
 

 
Since Tong Zhao was actually good at Honor of Kings (in reality, she was introduced to it by Wei Zekai), the production team had set up an account for her that was exactly like the one she remembered. Wei Zekai was surprised: “You’re also a king-tier player? What role do you play?”
 

 
He doubted her ability, suspecting she was carried by a high-level player.
 

 
The word “surprisingly” sounded a bit off-putting, but Wei Zekai himself meant no harm.
 

 
Tong Zhao gave him a glance and tentatively showed weakness: “If you’re really good, I could play support for you.”
 

 
As soon as he agreed, Tong Zhao could stage a scenario of "The Wild King and His Supportive Little Wife."
 

 
Unexpectedly, Wei Zekai raised his eyebrows. The self-reminder to be gentle with girls evaporated instantly, and his proud and youthful demeanor emerged sharply:
 

 
“Are you trying to leech off my points?”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao felt a pang of anger, her feelings hurt.
 

 
From her psychological activity, the live audience could see that although she often showed weakness to men, she was actually very ambitious and had a high sense of pride. This time, she flashed a delicate smile, her aura suddenly turning sharp: “Then I’ll take the support role.”
 

 
In the first game, she played as the side lane hero, Orange Jing.
 

 
In the second game, she chose the mid-lane hero, Shangguan Wan’er.
 

 
For the third game, she picked the marksman, Gongsun Li.
 

 
Finally, before the activity time limit ended, Tong Zhao chose the support position she had mentioned at the start. With her strong performance as Ghost Valley, she roamed the entire map, controlling the rhythm of the game. Under her influence, the opponents dared not show themselves. After winning four consecutive games and earning MVP in all, Tong Zhao let out a sigh of relief, feeling her mood improve a bit.
 

 
After calming down a little, Tong Zhao suddenly realized something.
 

 
She had forgotten that this was a perfect opportunity to strategize against Wei Zekai.
 

 
She should have let him take the stage instead...
 

 
Tong Zhao turned to look at Wei Zekai, and as if fate had its way, he also turned towards her at that moment.
 

 
“Wow…”
 

 
Wei Zekai looked at her with stars in his eyes, shining brightly: “Impressive, girl!”
 

 
…?
 

 
“Very few people can keep up with me. Your awareness and control are top-notch.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was generous with his praise.
 

 
The audience also noticed that Wei Zekai’s liking for Tong Zhao had indeed increased significantly.
 

 
[The way to marry into a wealthy family has been mastered: first, play as top-tier national server support.]
 

 
[Help, he’s not going to start seeing her as a brother, is he?]
 

 
[That look, it seems like he’s looking at a comrade.]
 

 
Tong Zhao was a bit speechless.
 

 
She was a quick learner, young with fast reactions, and excelled in MOBA and strategy games. After the four games, she had already figured out Wei Zekai’s general personality. With that in mind, duo queue turned out to be a good dating activity, a good way to understand each other's character. At the very least, it helps to exclude boys who frequently go AFK and curse in the game.
 

 
Wei Zekai had a bit of a personal heroism streak; he wanted to win the game by carrying it himself.
 

 
At the same time, he wouldn’t abandon his teammates and had a sense of loyalty.
 

 
However, he lacked a broad perspective and was prone to focusing too much on one point, potentially losing a good game.
 

 
When Tong Zhao asked him to do something, if Tong Zhao had more kills than he did, he would obediently follow her instructions. In a similar situation, Tong Zhao felt that He Shun would not follow orders and could only be guided through coaxing.
 

 
[Much cuter than that guy named He.]
 

 
[But he keeps secretly leeching off my lanes while jungling, which is a bit annoying.]
 

 
In contrast to Wei Zekai’s increased affection, Tong Zhao’s feelings for him slightly declined.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s evaluation of her was genuinely high.
 

 
He thought the girl was excellent, serious about relationships, and skilled at gaming.
 

 
Wei Zekai glanced at her with a bit of arrogance, thinking:
 

 
[I must protect her love.]
 

 
When the event ended, Tong Zhao closed the game:
 

 
[When should I start tricking him into taking the bait?]
 

 
……
 

 
On the other side, Han Zhi was at the villa’s bar, mixing drinks for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
Wearing a long black trench coat, Han Zhi looked like he stepped out of a Korean drama, making Chang Xiaonian hesitant to look him in the face.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian appeared somewhat reserved: “You might not realize this, but I can really drink a lot. No need to make cocktails; just a bottle of white wine will do.”
 

 
Her tone was slightly lifted, deliberately rough.
 

 
This was at odds with her usual sweet persona.
 

 
She had no choice.
 

 
Despite her constant chatter with her friends about how all handsome guys are jerks, in the presence of a genuinely handsome man like Han Zhi, she felt awkward and uneasy, unable to speak freely. She was somewhat insecure. Therefore, she tried hard to appear casual and carefree in front of Han Zhi.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no ambition to be a queen of hearts.
 

 
She subconsciously felt she couldn’t handle someone of Han Zhi’s caliber.
 

 
Regardless of any friendly signals he might give, they only served to heighten her wariness.
 

 
Han Zhi categorized this as one of the troubles of being a handsome man.
 

 
[Using "I'm not interested in you" as a subtext to protect oneself,]
 

 
Han Zhi took out the liquor he was about to mix: [Girls… are really all quite charming.]
# Chapter43
Vodka, Cointreau, lemon juice, cranberry juice...
 

 
Ice cubes clinked crisply as they tumbled into the shaker, followed by colorful liquids swirling through the air, tracing vibrant patterns.
 

 
Han Zhi's cocktail-making was effortless and relaxed, exuding a calm and skilled aura. He didn’t seem like a bartender but more like someone showcasing a personal hobby after work, displaying it only to close friends. His posture and gaze were relaxed.
 

 
Generally, when spending time alone together, one person’s nervousness can affect the other.
 

 
But with Han Zhi, that wasn’t the case.
 

 
He remained completely relaxed.
 

 
He was also patient, willing to wait slowly for his partner to drop her guard, exuding an effortless composure—If you’re nervous, go at your own pace. If you have no ideas, no experience, or no rhythm, that’s fine too. We’ll take it slow, as long as you’re happy.
 

 
Given the distance across the bar, Chang Xiaonian thought she could resist the allure of a handsome man.
 

 
It was definitely better than being alone in a private screening room.
 

 
Whenever she thought about how her slightly flattened nose affected her profile, or how her skin started to oil up after just half an hour indoors, she felt a strong urge to flee. She understood why Zhong Muxi said after watching a movie with Han Zhi—
 

 
[“He’s a really great man, but the better he is, the more I feel inadequate.”]
 

 
At the time, Chang Xiaonian had been fed a lot of the usual "girls are angels" and "you’re a perfect match" motivational talk.
 

 
But when faced with Han Zhi...
 

 
Under different influences, girls are often unable to learn the kind of “beautiful people thinking that any glance from them means interest” confidence.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian gathered her courage and took a furtive glance at him.
 

 
Unexpectedly, Han Zhi was also looking at her.
 

 
His originally indifferent and focused expression softened into a smile as their eyes met, his previously aloof and melancholic face seemed to light up with a smile because of her.
 

 
...
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned, and her heart nearly skipped a beat.
 

 
Help, where did this enchanting man come from?
 

 
The production team expertly captured this moment with a close-up shot.
 

 
Fans who had been waiting for their favorite scenes from the older brother’s segment covered their hearts and cried out:
 

 
[Although I don’t like Chang Xiaonian, I totally understand her reaction...]
 

 
[Brother Zhi’s solo performance, oh my god, it’s so sour I’m in tears.]
 

 
[Ah, I should have signed up for this variety show too! I’m willing to embarrass myself on the show!]
 

 
[Fans, give up. Your subconscious is automatically drawn to variety shows; without needing Han Zhi to charm you, you’ve already given in.]
 

 
...
 

 
"Cosmopolitan, a timeless classic."
 

 
Han Zhi pushed the prepared cocktail towards Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
The lights in the bar were somewhat hazy, casting a dreamy hue over the deep red cocktail in the martini glass. It wasn’t overly bright, which would have made it look cheap; instead, it had a subtle elegance. A freshly cut lime wedge perched on the rim of the glass. This cocktail was as common as Chanel No. 5, but being commonplace meant it was very palatable, withstanding the impact of new trends, and it was also suitable for women who were not very familiar with cocktails.
 

 
Besides...
 

 
Most girls cannot resist beautifully colored drinks.
 

 
"Ah, thank you."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thanked him softly and took the glass—
 

 
Before mixing the drinks, Han Zhi had soaked the martini glass in ice water and then wiped it dry, ensuring that the cocktail would present the best flavor when served to her. The glass was pleasantly cold to the touch, and the drink was cool and smooth, with rich, silky liquor and a sweet and tangy fruit aroma.
 

 
While she sipped the cocktail, Han Zhi prepared himself a glass of gin and tonic.
 

 
A gin and tonic is quick to make, with ingredients varying from simple to complex, making it hard to mess up. It can be both very good and very bad, with a high lower limit and a high upper limit, fresh and slightly bitter. After taking a few sips, Han Zhi noticed Chang Xiaonian looking at him and pushed his glass forward with a smile. "Would you like to try this one?"
 

 
This was the glass he had used.
 

 
The ice and liquor in the glass were crystal clear, and through the bar counter, the man’s handsome face appeared to shimmer dreamily.
 

 
Under the mood of the moment, Chang Xiaonian, without much hesitation, took the glass and took a big sip.
 

 
The liquor was refreshing and slightly sweet on the palate. The unique aroma of the gin first washed over her, and as she swallowed quickly, only a hint of tonic water's bitterness remained on her tongue. Strangely, Han Zhi had somehow managed to create a gin and tonic that achieved a level of bitterness without any harshness. Han Zhi, who had prepared the drink, was watching her with a gentle and bright expression...
 

 
The two drinks he made, besides the sweet one for her, were particularly refreshing.
 

 
It seemed like he was just there to enjoy the drinks with her, rather than showing off any elaborate cocktail skills or knowledge.
 

 
Han Zhi knew exactly how she perceived him.
 

 
A handsome, aggressive playboy, a walking heart trap.
 

 
[Action is always the most compelling evidence.]
 

 
[When a woman doubts you, don’t explain. Let her interpret you herself; she will only believe what she has discovered on her own.]
 

 
Unlike Tong Zhao’s proud sarcasm, Han Zhi’s feelings about women conveyed an almost compassionate gentleness.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian propped her chin on her hands and asked, "How many girls have you made drinks for?"
 

 
She regretted asking as soon as the words were out.
 

 
"I haven’t kept count. Guests are guests. Friends often bring their friends to my place for drinks. Some might ask for cocktails they’ve seen on TikTok, like whisky with water. The technique isn’t difficult, but it’s not special—it’s just a lot of work."
 

 
Watering down whisky is a method invented by the Japanese for tasting whisky.
 

 
In summary, it involves adding ice to whisky and stirring it until the ice melts and forms a thin, even layer of frost on the surface, giving it a particularly hazy and beautiful appearance. Achieving this effect requires the bartender to stir constantly for ten to twenty minutes, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It’s annoying enough in a bar, let alone when visiting someone’s home.
 

 
"Have you made any of those?" Chang Xiaonian asked curiously.
 

 
"Mojito, Martini, and Gin and Tonic—pick one," Han Zhi replied with a hint of coolness, which amused her. "I thought you were the type to cater to every request."
 

 
"Not at all. I'm no saint."
 

 
Han Zhi lifted his glass.
 

 
As he tilted it back and drank, his Adam’s apple moved slightly.
 

 
Seeing this, Chang Xiaonian found herself swallowing as well.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [So this is how attractive a man looks while drinking?]
 

 
The comments quickly disagreed:
 

 
[No, sister, it’s only him.]
 

 
[Our brother Zhi is a walking X medicine!]
 

 
[For close-up gifs of Zhi drinking, please click on my profile~]
 

 
……
 

 
The bar counter is a clever design.
 

 
Sitting next to each other, they can’t see each other’s facial expressions all the time, allowing for more space for imagination. When speaking softly, their shoulders might lightly touch as they whisper, a small gesture that is warm and flirtatious, like striking a match in the middle of the night.
 

 
Without needing to see Han Zhi’s face directly, Chang Xiaonian felt much more at ease. She joked, "The whisky that takes fifteen minutes to make must be really something."
 

 
"They say whisky made with the water dilution method has the best taste, but I think it’s just a gimmick."
 

 
Han Zhi continued to chat with her in a relaxed manner.
 

 
They chatted about everything under the sun.
 

 
Even without seeing his face, just hearing his deep and captivating voice coming from the left made Chang Xiaonian feel her left cheek tingle and flush. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him. This segment of the conversation was fast-forwarded by the AI during playback, causing a huge backlash from fans. It wasn’t until the special effects commentary explained that a personal cut version would be released that the outrage subsided.
 

 
Alright then.
 

 
Maybe the atmosphere was too good; Chang Xiaonian found herself completely relaxed around him, without the previous discomfort.
 

 
She even understood why Zhong Muxi, who claimed not to like men anymore, had such a high opinion of Han Zhi.
 

 
"Among the three of us, you seem most interested in Wei Zekai," Han Zhi suddenly said.
 

 
"Mm," Chang Xiaonian surprisingly admitted, "He matches my fantasy of love... I've been in relationships, but they never felt right, didn’t meet my expectations, and were different from what’s written in novels. I guess I might not have found the right person."
 

 
The comments were mixed.
 

 
[She never said this much to her girlfriends!]
 

 
[It's a waste of talent that Brother Zhi doesn’t do MLM; he easily gets people to speak their true feelings.]
 

 
[True high-level heartthrob…]
 

 
The production team was anxious as well.
 

 
The director was worried Chang Xiaonian might end up like He Shun and be an easy win.
 

 
It seemed that Han Zhi and Tong Zhao were of a similar type—using subtle hints and face-to-face interactions to win people over. This could make the show less interesting. The screenwriter, seeing the director's anxiety, couldn’t help but comment, “This is a common issue with reality TV romance shows featuring celebrities and ordinary people. In real life, how could a stunning beauty like Tong Zhao fail to get a confession? A single flirtatious glance and a man would obediently walk over.”
 

 
The director shot him a sharp look: "This is your script."
 

 
The screenwriter pretended to be deaf and focused on the distant view: "Look at the messy beauty of the tangled wires in the server room."
 

 
“……”
 

 
Back to the variety show.
 

 
"The right person is very important. I believe that love, like any other skill in the world, requires practice," Han Zhi said as he stirred the drink with a long spoon. The sound of ice-clinking became the background music for his words.
 

 
He was skilled at listening, but his speaking was also charming. Even if he recited *Capital* by Marx, it would likely have the romantic poetry of sonnets and *The Flight of the Bird*: "Loving someone and accepting their affection requires repeated learning. A single instance is a rare miracle, but such miracles are often continuously depicted in literary works."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian responded with a bitter smile: "I do long for that kind of love, you know, not a rationally chosen fit, but something that makes my heart race and feel like it might burst at any moment. But when I see the other person, it feels like it's worth even dying for…"
 

 
At this moment, she almost regarded Han Zhi as a good friend to vent to.
 

 
This was the moment when Han Zhi, the handsome man, was the most indistinct in her mind as a "love interest," with the least amount of suspicion.
 

 
[If we keep this conversational pace, she might really have no feelings for me the next day.]
 

 
Han Zhi analyzed calmly.
 

 
Before Chang Xiaonian could finish speaking, she felt a weight on her shoulder.
 

 
Han Zhi leaned in, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and gently pulling her toward him, maintaining a slight distance without real physical contact. Chang Xiaonian looked up, her gaze fixed on the man’s handsome, alluring face, the sharp lines of his jaw, and the half-smiling curve of his lips, which were imprinted deeply on her retina.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was momentarily stunned and didn’t push him away.
 

 
She swallowed hard.
 

 
"Do you feel this way about me?"
 

 
Han Zhi’s demeanor shifted from his previous gentleness to a cold and distant gaze, yet his slightly shallow eyes were filled with an unspoken, lingering affection.
 

 
How could this kind of emotion be acted out?
 

 
Under the close-up shot, the director couldn't understand at all.
 

 
This scumbag’s acting was just too damn good.
 

 
But it wasn’t acted out.
 

 
Han Zhi’s character was shaped by the experience of Chang Xiaonian’s initial transformation into a man. Seeing women from a male perspective, he understood how much harder it was for them, which fostered a kind of affectionate empathy towards women. Thus, he could easily fall in love with someone; this feeling wasn’t fake or acted.
 

 
He hoped every girl could find happiness.
 

 
“Uh…”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned.
 

 
Her immunity to handsome men vanished in an instant.
 

 
Her senses were numbed, only able to hear the sound of her racing heart and Han Zhi’s previous words playing back in her mind with Dolby surround sound, making her almost forget to breathe.
 

 
“Don’t lie.”
 

 
Han Zhi lowered his gaze, his tone slightly stern.
 

 
Was the earlier gentleness all just an act? Under the close-up of his handsome face, Chang Xiaonian lost her ability to think normally, responding instinctively, “Yes…”
 

 
“Heart racing fast?” Han Zhi’s thin lips curled into a faint smile.
 

 
After a moment, Chang Xiaonian regained a bit of her composure, turning her face away awkwardly and taking deep breaths, “Help, this is too much. Don’t scare me like this, I can hardly breathe…”
 

 
“Have a sip of something cold to calm down.”
 

 
Han Zhi released her and pushed a glass of whiskey towards her.
 

 
“Okay.”
 

 
After catching her breath, Chang Xiaonian straightened up, blushing as she stared at the glass.
 

 
She focused on the drink, as if it were engraved with a thousand words, enough to make her escape reality for half an hour.
 

 
Panicked, extremely panicked.
 

 
She hadn’t felt this way even when alone with Wei Zekai!
 

 
The last time they cooked together, she had been so annoyed by Wei Zekai’s two flirtatious moves that she wanted to scold him. Rich second-generation types were so clueless and pretentious, how arrogant!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stared at the glass for a while, suddenly noticing something different about the whiskey.
 

 
The thin layer of frost on the inside of the glass made the pure golden liquor appear to be wearing a dreamy veil, obscuring its structure. In a flash, she remembered that during their conversation, she had avoided looking directly at Han Zhi out of evasion toward handsome men. In the pauses between their words, she could also hear the sound of the long spoon stirring the drink.
 

 
This was the water-cut whiskey Han Zhi had prepared for the guest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian held the cold glass with both hands, feeling the warmth of her palms and her heart.
 

 
She asked hesitantly, “Didn’t you say this was troublesome and you didn’t want to make it?”
 

 
“Were you not curious about how a drink that takes fifteen minutes to make would look?” Han Zhi reached out and touched her ear, as if the polite gentleman before was just a facade. With millions of viewers witnessing Chang Xiaonian’s rising affection for him, he sighed and said, “And the feeling of your heart racing with excitement... Since you want to know, I’ll satisfy your curiosity.”
 

 
Han Zhi’s voice was low and husky, and the spot where his large hand touched her tingled.
 

 
Fortunately, she was sitting; otherwise, Chang Xiaonian felt her legs might give out.
 

 
She took a sip of the whiskey.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought, [Damn, why does this whiskey taste sweet?]
 

 
Whiskey, of course, should not be sweet.
 

 
Even if it could show you images of the Virgin Mary and the Himalayas with a single sip in "The Drops of God," whiskey is fundamentally spicy and bitter. Even though it becomes smoother after water-cutting, the only reason for a sweet taste would be if her taste buds were malfunctioning.
 

 
The brain controls all the nerves.
 

 
So, it must be a problem with the brain.
 

 
When you feel moved by someone else, your brain is already beginning to malfunction.
 

 
The comments:
 

 
[Woman, something’s wrong with you.]
 

 
[The drink stirred for 15 minutes by my brother, even if it were just plain water, would still taste sweet.]
 

 
[How much money do I need to spend to get a VIP experience and see things from this female guest’s perspective?????]
 

 
Female viewers vented their excitement through comments, while male viewers took notes on these techniques that would never be used in real life.
 

 
Han Zhi cast a lazy glance over.
 

 
“Do you want to try that heart-racing feeling again?”
 

 
He didn’t give the young lady strong liquor, but the other drinks he made were strong. With his slightly tipsy eyes now even more poetic, he poured tons of hormones onto Chang Xiaonian’s heart. The audience behind the screen could hardly handle it, and she, facing this human-like walking aphrodisiac, couldn’t hold out either.
 

 
[Should I refuse him?]
 

 
[This is ridiculous; he’s actually a jerk, isn’t he?]
 

 
[Maybe he’s extremely dangerous...]
 

 
These were Chang Xiaonian’s thoughts.
 

 
What she said out loud was:
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Without hesitation, Han Zhi pulled her into his embrace.
 

 
This time, there was no polite distance; she fell solidly into his arms. She could smell a faint hint of incense on him... There was no tobacco scent as described in novels; he might not smoke at all, but she couldn’t help but inhale deeply against his chest.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian wanted to listen to his heartbeat to see if it was speeding up for her.
 

 
Unfortunately, her own heartbeat was pounding so hard that she couldn’t hear anything else.
 

 
“Do you feel like a heroine in a romance novel now?” Han Zhi asked with a smile, more like teasing her.
 

 
If he had acted like this from the beginning, no matter how handsome he was, he would have received a slap.
 

 
The problem was that he was too good at setting the atmosphere, gradually breaking down her defenses.
 

 
Han Zhi had pinpointed the young woman’s vulnerabilities.
 

 
She wanted an unreal romantic adventure like in a novel, a domineering man who would lead her by the nose—an experience that Wei Zekai couldn’t provide. [That young master is barely capable of handling Tong Zhao, let alone this...] Han Zhi thought with indifference as the girl in his arms asked earnestly:
 

 
“Han Zhi, are you using a Casanova card?”
 

 
Caught out!
 

 
It turned out Chang Xiaonian wasn’t completely clueless!
 

 
The audience suddenly tensed, and the production team was delighted; finally, something was developing in the direction they had hoped for.
 

 
“Jerk, your day has come!” The assistant director rubbed his hands in anticipation.
 

 
The most interesting part of reality shows is when the seemingly unbeatable side falters.
 

 
The screenwriter coolly poured cold water on the situation: “Don’t get your hopes up too high. Hearing Han Zhi’s low voice, he could easily explain anything. Even if he said the sun rises in the west, some women might believe him.”
 

 
The stagehand raised her hand in support: “I would!”
 

 
Everyone agreed.
 

 
Given Han Zhi’s level, it was easy to charm a young girl.
 

 
…
 

 
“Yes.”
 

 
Han Zhi pinched her chin, lifting it to force her to meet his gaze. His lips curled slightly: “Are you going to expose me?”
 

 
[???]
 

 
[Self-destruct card? Why self-destruct?]
 

 
Rarely, the production team backstage was just as stunned as the audience.
 

 
He could have easily completed the task with a lie.
 

 
From the increasing affection, it was clear Chang Xiaonian was thoroughly smitten. If Han Zhi guided her a bit more intentionally, she might fall even more for him than she did for He Shun.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian’s cheeks and eyes reddened: “Were you deliberately flirting with me?”
 

 
She was both embarrassed and annoyed.
 

 
Indeed, if it weren’t for the Casanova card, how could a handsome guy like Han Zhi be so nice and gentle to her? It was just about the reward…
 

 
Before she could escape his embrace, Han Zhi caught her hand and placed it on his chest.
 

 
Han Zhi whispered, “After seeing you, I really enjoyed the mission it gave me.”
 

 
What she felt in his palm was a heartbeat much faster than usual.
 

 
It turned out Han Zhi was just like her…!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian quickly pulled her hand away, tears on the brink of falling, but her lips curved into a smile, clearly pacified.
 

 
So, did the Casanova really fall for her?
 

 
[Alcohol is truly a great thing.]
 

 
[Low-tier Casanova gets girls drunk, whereas I just need to get myself drunk.]
 

 
Han Zhi curled his lips.
 

 
A line of special effects text slowly appeared on the screen, accompanied by the sound of keyboard typing:
 

 
“Ethanol in alcohol stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which may increase the heart rate.”
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……Impressive, Casanova!]
 

 
[Please, go line up with Tong Zhao already; stop torturing the low-tier level!]
 

 
[Only I can seduce myself/dog head!]
 

 
Han Zhi still held her, his internal monologue coldly mocking the production team’s naivety: [People always misunderstand what lovers truly want. Her question about whether I’m using a Casanova card wasn’t about being deceived, but about feeling that I don’t actually love her and that I’m only flirting with her reluctantly to complete a mission. This realization has hurt her pride, making her feel embarrassed and angry…]
 

 
[Well, as long as she knows that I do have feelings for her, that’s enough.]
 

 
[Love has no right or wrong; the more emotional a person is, the simpler their desires.]
 

 
[If you don’t delve into your lover's true needs, you’ll end up in a miserable state of endless arguments and conflicts.]
 

 
[The most important thing is, I don’t like to deceive women.]
 

 
[Here, there is no sadness, only love.]
 

 
The Casanova’s inner monologue shattered countless audience hearts.
 

 
The dating reality show had officially turned into an emotional drama.
 

 
Under the shocked gaze of millions of viewers, Chang Xiaonian became even more attached to Han Zhi upon learning his true identity.
 

 
Why is this happening?
 

 
Chang Xiaonian herself didn’t understand why she felt this way.
 

 
But Han Zhi understood—
 

 
[Once I know that I have clear points of attraction for her, she relaxes a lot, which is a good sign.]
 

 
What’s most frightening is that Casanova understands women better than women do.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian hesitated and filled in his name on the heart-throb app.
 

 
As a reward, Han Zhi lifted her face and gave her a light kiss on the forehead.
 

 
In short, he could fulfill every cliché of a romance drama.
 

 
“Alright, you win. You don’t need to pay any more attention to me from now on, okay?” Chang Xiaonian turned her face away and joked.
 

 
But the camera captured her eyes welling up with tears.
 

 
“You seem to misunderstand me,”
 

 
Han Zhi, both amused and exasperated, turned her face back to look at him and said, “I won’t let go until you learn to confidently accept someone’s affection.”
 

 
The audience was overwhelmed by how much this line sounded like a romance novel.
 

 
What kind of man can even say something like that?
 

 
“So how are you going to teach me?” Chang Xiaonian was quite taken by this approach.
 

 
“Let’s start by getting you used to looking directly at me.”
 

 
[... I just want to know what her reaction will be when she finds out that her idol and the girl she dislikes are the same person after leaving the holographic chamber.]
 

 
[Upvote 1]
 

 
[Also, Han Zhi, please start a class for us male fans!]
 

 
[Don’t teach anymore, it’s embarrassing.]
 

 
Meanwhile, in the corridor on the other side...
 

 
Tong Zhao, who was about to go downstairs to make a late-night snack, crossed paths with a dog wagging its little tail.
# Chapter44
What to do, what to do, what to do!
 

 
Since it had shrunk, everything seemed like a game from the perspective of Wei Zekai. It could almost feel a huge flashing red "Danger" character above its head... Right in front of it, Tong Zhao was towering over, staring at it. The little tail that had been wagging so happily froze, slowly drooped, and tucked itself between its legs.
 

 
Nervous.
 

 
Maybe it should turn around and run. How could a mere human catch it!
 

 
Unfortunately, by the time Wei Zekai thought of this, it was too late.
 

 
Tong Zhao had already walked up to it, bent down, and grabbed the loose skin on the back of its neck: "Why is there a dog here?"
 

 
She had been living here for quite some time and had seen plenty of koi fish in the garden, but not a single small animal. Even the guard dog was nowhere to be seen. Chang Xiaonian had sighed in relief about that, saying she was terrified of dogs and was on edge when they entered—after all, in movies, estates like this are typically guarded by a whole pack of black German Shepherds.
 

 
Tong Zhao shook the little dog in her hand: "This one doesn’t look like it could guard anything."
 

 
...
 

 
"Woof!"
 

 
What do you mean? Feeling underestimated, Wei Zekai burst into a rage and barked at Tong Zhao.
 

 
He couldn't stand being looked down upon.
 

 
Just like when he's playing games—if the opponent dares to taunt him, he’ll dive into the tower and rush to the enemy's base to trade one-for-one, no matter the risk. He always felt this was a basic move for a man of honor, a principle he sticks to, and becoming a little dog wouldn't change that.
 

 
How about that, super fierce, right?
 

 
In that small body was hidden big energy, and Wei Zekai bared his canine teeth to scare her.
 

 
This was Wei Zekai’s point of view.
 

 
He thought he was terrifying.
 

 
However, from the audience's third-person perspective…
 

 
[Hahaha, where did this little puppy trying to be fierce come from? Too cute!]
 

 
[Never thought the show’s mascot would be a rich kid, so adorably soft! Come home with me, little one.]
 

 
[Does he really think he’s intimidating?]
 

 
Quick-fingered netizens had already hit replay, captured GIFs, and added captions like [Roaring Tiger.gif].
 

 
Tong Zhao, of course, wasn’t scared.
 

 
But she did sense that the dog was trying to act tough towards her.
 

 
How coincidental, she’s not someone who can handle provocation well either.
 

 
Tong Zhao's soft lips curved into a faint smile: "So fierce, huh? Are you daring enough to bite me?"
 

 
As she spoke, she extended her hand toward the dog’s mouth.
 

 
In an instinctive reaction, even pet dogs will bite.
 

 
Tong Zhao had raised dogs before, and from the way it barked, she could tell it was all bark and no bite—a harmless pet dog.
 

 
When that soft, white hand reached the dog’s mouth, Wei Zekai froze—
 

 
What are you doing!
 

 
He’s not really a dog after all; he’s still quite conscious of gender, so he quickly turned his head to the side.
 

 
“Heh.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled softly, holding him by the scruff of his neck with one hand and supporting his little Dog bottom with the other, walking toward her room: "No need for a midnight snack; let's play something else."
 

 
Naturally, Wei Zekai wasn’t willing to be taken to the room.
 

 
It kicked its legs, struggling to break free, but didn't dare show its claws. As a result, Tong Zhao pressed it into her arms, forcibly subduing it.
 

 
And then it quieted down.
 

 
Because where she pressed it... was soft and fragrant —
 

 
Its little tail wagged, and the entire dog gave up.
 

 
Wei Zekai swore, he never intended to use his ability to transform into a dog to take advantage of girls. And because of his integrity, the intelligent AI didn’t detect any inappropriate thoughts, so it didn’t issue any warnings... This proved that, even though the little dog’s face was pressed into an indescribable place, his thoughts were completely innocent.
 

 
But the audience wasn't so pure.
 

 
[Let go of that dog, let me take its place!!!!]
 

 
[I can't wait to see how awkward he'll feel when he gets his memory back after this.]
 

 
[Wei Corgi can't breathe / dog emoji]
 

 
["A Blessing in Disguise"]
 

 
"You're quite obedient."
 

 
Tong Zhao originally thought it would struggle for a while, but unexpectedly, it quieted down as soon as she pressed it into her arms. After entering her room, she quickly shut the door, cutting off Wei Corgi's escape route. When she finally released her hold on it, it immediately slumped against her shoulder, gasping for fresh air.
 

 
‘Phew… almost suffocated me to death.’
 

 
‘Good thing it didn’t last long, or I’d have lost my dog's life.’
 

 
Wei Zekai’s inner thoughts, still filled with lingering fear, sparked outrage from the audience.
 

 
Unbelievable, this guy doesn't know how good he has it!
 

 
Tong Zhao patted its back: "It's boring being alone. From now on, I’m your owner."
 

 
Dog Wei: Huh?
 

 
Dog Wei: You think you're worthy of being my owner? Really think I’m just a dog? You’re nothing.
 

 
As he spoke, Dog Wei barked twice at her, trying to act fierce again.
 

 
For the moment, he didn’t think about jumping down, but then he saw Tong Zhao carrying him toward the bathroom.
 

 
[!!! Is she going to bathe with the dog?]
 

 
[So exciting! Is this really content they can air? Not treating us like outsiders at all, huh?]
 

 
[GKDGKDGKDGKDGKD!]
 

 
When the bathroom door closed, Dog Wei really started to panic. He jumped to the floor, frantically scratching at the door and barking loudly, clearly signaling Tong Zhao to let him out. Unfortunately, she ignored him and began filling the bathtub halfway with water. After testing the temperature and making sure it was right, she turned back to the supposedly fierce little puppy with a gentle smile.
 

 
Sensing something, Dog Wei turned around too.
 

 
Of course, Tong Zhao taking a bath wouldn’t be aired.
 

 
But bathing a little dog? No problem.
 

 
“Woof? Woof! Woof woof woof!”
 

 
Wei Zekai froze, half his body being pressed into the warm water.
 

 
He kicked and splashed wildly in the tub for a while, and when he realized that the splashing water was getting Tong Zhao’s clothes wet, he didn’t even dare to resist anymore.
 

 
The viewers weren't happy about this.
 

 
[Come on, move a little, doggi! Just move a bit!]
 

 
[We don't need the extra traffic, turn it up a notch, please.]
 

 
[Give it a rest. Even if her clothes do get wet, the AI would blur it with extreme pixelation before anyone can screenshot it. Don’t underestimate how well this show protects the guests’ privacy.]
 

 
With a stunned expression that could shake an entire family, Dog Wei was thoroughly scrubbed all over. It wasn’t until Tong Zhao dried his fur with a blow dryer that he snapped out of his shock, though his inner thoughts were still filled with doubts about his dog life—
 

 
Did I just get bathed by someone?
 

 
What do I do!?
 

 
...It felt kinda nice though...
 

 
As Wei Zekai's rationality returned, he remembered that he only had one hour in this transformed state. He had to escape before the hour was up, or his identity would be exposed! But no matter how much he struggled, Tong Zhao held him tightly, leaving him utterly hopeless—
 

 
Damn it, why did he have to turn into a Dog?
 

 
If only he were a large dog, he wouldn't be so powerless right now!
 

 
"Struggling so much... is it because you don’t want to be my dog?" Tong Zhao asked, looking down at him.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sensing a glimmer of hope, nodded frantically.
 

 
Yes, he remembered that Tong Zhao was supposed to be a gentle, sweet girl who wouldn’t make things difficult for a dog.
 

 
Just as he thought this, he saw Tong Zhao’s elegant and sweet face curl into a smirk.
 

 
Gentle and sweet?
 

 
Her usually clear, light-colored eyes were now swirling with arrogance and mischief. The malice in her gaze pierced Dog Wei's confidence like tangible tendrils. With his keen dog hearing, he clearly caught her next two sentences:
 

 
"I like dogs that don't like me."
 

 
"From now on, you're my dog."
 

 
...
 

 
Dog Wei was baffled.
 

 
Gentle and sweet? That doesn’t exist—she was just playing with them.
 

 
Behave now, it's time to kneel and call her master.
 

 
Tong Zhao patted his head.
 

 
In her mind, however, she thought, ‘This dog is too smart; it must belong to someone.’
 

 
She decided to keep an eye out for any missing dog posters over the next couple of days, but for now, she'd play with him before returning him to his owner.
 

 
Dog Wei kicked his back legs against her shoulder, hoping to bring back the gentle and kind girl he thought she was. However, his defiant legs were quickly caught in her hand. "You're all clean now, time for bed," she said as she carried the little dog toward the bed.
 

 
The audience collectively let out a sharp "hiss."
 

 
Dog Wei began to struggle.
 

 
By this time, only five minutes remained before his transformation would wear off.
 

 
On-screen, the poor little dog was shown with its limbs restrained. Tong Zhao, slightly annoyed, grabbed his tail, saying, "I’ve got your little tail, behave."
 

 
Dogs aren't naturally tailless. Originally, tails were docked for cattle herding purposes, but later it became a cosmetic trend for pets.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s dog, who still had his tail, now had his weakness held in Tong Zhao's hands.
 

 
‘Crap! Let me go, let me go, let me go!’
 

 
Dog Wei’s inner thoughts were a complete mess.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew exactly how to handle small dogs. Although she had him firmly under control, it didn’t hurt him. His mind was completely blank.
 

 
Finally, with three minutes left, Wei Zekai managed to brush against a ticklish spot on Tong Zhao’s waist. As she loosened her grip from the tickling, he rolled off the bed, sprang up, and used his front paws to press down on the door handle, slipping out through the gap in the door. By the time Tong Zhao rushed out after him, she saw the little corgi scrambling and rolling in a series of tactical maneuvers, running straight into Wei Zekai’s room.
 

 
Moments later, the door closed behind him.
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Huh? So this dog belongs to Wei Zekai?’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘Come to think of it, they do seem alike.’
 

 
Tong Zhao: ‘But I’ve never seen him walk a dog... And after all that noise just now, he didn’t come looking for it, which is kind of weird. Though I was the second-to-last one to arrive at the manor, so maybe he settled in earlier. Hmph, if he owns a dog, Chang Xiaonian's dream of marrying into a rich family might be shattered, since she’s afraid of dogs.’
 

 
Without a dog to cuddle anymore, and feeling a bit tired after all the commotion, Tong Zhao regretfully got ready for bed.
 

 
At the same time, Wei Zekai, now back in human form, swore he would never turn into a dog again!
 

 
That was way too terrifying!
 

 
He locked the door from the inside and threw himself onto the soft bed, his heart pounding wildly.
 

 
“Damn it, stop thinking about it, just pull up the blanket and sleep!”
 

 
According to the Polar Bear Law, the more you try not to think about something, the more vividly it comes to mind. The brain, it seems, is everyone’s biggest traitor. Wei Zekai was now facing this very dilemma—
 

 
He hadn’t realized it when he was barking, but just now... where had his face been buried on Tong Zhao?
 

 
Crap?
 

 
That night, some slept soundly, while one “dog” struggled to sleep at all.
 

 
※
 

 
The next day at noon, while out for a group activity, Wei Zekai was approached by Tong Zhao.
 

 
Casually, she asked, “Do you have a dog? Last night I saw one running into your room.”
 

 
“No!” Wei Zekai denied it in an instant. “You must’ve seen wrong.”
 

 
“...”
 

 
Tong Zhao had only asked offhandedly.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s reaction was way too strong—so strong that it was suspicious. She was sure she hadn’t seen wrong. The dog had definitely run into his room, and the door had only closed after the dog went inside, which meant someone had been in there. She lowered her eyes and didn’t press further. “Hmm, I guess I must have been mistaken.”
 

 
She was so easygoing, it was like she wasn’t the same mischievous girl from last night.
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t help himself and kept sneaking glances at her face.
 

 
Her side profile was just as flawless as her full face, with her nose and lips shaped perfectly. When she looked at someone, she often smiled before speaking, which made her seem especially sweet.
 

 
So why was she so unfriendly to dogs?
 

 
Recalling last night’s ordeal, Wei Zekai still felt lingering fear.
 

 
It was the first time he had been grabbed by the scruff of his neck, had his tail pulled, and then been dunked into a bathtub like that.
 

 
His intense reaction caught Tong Zhao’s attention—
 

 
Wei Zekai had already been her second target to pursue, so she had been watching his every move closely.
 

 
Tong Zhao thought to herself: There’s definitely something strange about that dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao's thoughts:
 

 
“The door was only ajar and got pushed open by that little corgi. When a dog is panicking, why didn’t it run down the stairs? Obviously, Wei Zekai’s room made it feel safer. Wei Zekai is lying... With his personality, if he didn’t want me near his dog, he would’ve said so directly instead of lying.”
 

 
One suspicious point after another surfaced.
 

 
Viewers sighed:
 

 
[Give it up, Young Master Wei, you can't outsmart her.]
 

 
Though the idea of someone turning into a dog seemed too far-fetched, Tong Zhao was still heading in the right direction.
 

 
After all, anyone with the "Judge" identity card would have special abilities.
 

 
Maybe the official gave him a well-trained dog to spy on other players’ moves, which would explain why he lied to cover it up. Otherwise, why would he hide the dog? If Wei Zekai was the Judge, she would need to be extra cautious. At the very least...
 

 
She couldn’t let him suspect that she was the "Sea King."
 

 
She needed a convincing reason to get closer to Wei Zekai.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “Even though I don’t really want to use this method...”
 

 
From her tone, the viewers could tell she was genuinely reluctant.
 

 
But what method was she thinking of?
 

 
[Seduction! Seduction! Seduction!]
 

 
[Wake up, those of you chanting for seduction! Do you really think that’s going to work on the last clean soul in our rich kids' circle? No way.]
 

 
The director aptly cued in a heavy, suspenseful beat as background music.
 

 
Tong Zhao leaned in slightly and extended a very crucial invitation:
 

 
"Wanna duo later?"
 

 
For someone of her caliber, using gaming skills to lure a guy was a bit of a downfall.
 

 
But this was exactly the bait Wei Zekai would fall for.
 

 
Playing with a skilled partner who could work well with him was too much fun, and a look of hesitation immediately appeared on his handsome face. After a brief struggle, he nodded reluctantly:
 

 
"Alright!"
 

 
Damn it, he couldn’t resist the temptation of a duo match!
 

 
Not far away, He Shun, noticing the two of them chatting animatedly, started to feel uneasy. However, when he saw that they were just playing a popular mobile game, he felt relieved:
 

 
He Shun: "Oh, they’re just gaming."
 

 
He Shun didn’t realize that playing games together, especially in a duo, was an excellent way to strengthen emotional bonds.
 

 
Viewers who were into pure love found it amusing.
 

 
After seeing a lot of flirting, a dose of wholesome interaction wasn’t bad for a change.
 

 
However...
 

 
These two really were *just* playing the game.
 

 
Tong Zhao, multitasking, tried to steer the conversation toward relationships, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not:
 

 
"You're pretty good at this game. Do you often carry girls?"
 

 
"Women only slow down my sword speed!"
 

 
[......]
 

 
"So, you’ve never dated anyone?"
 

 
"Never dated, doesn’t matter," Wei Zekai said with a smile after securing the first kill in the game. "Love isn’t a necessity. If I had to say, I’m more interested in protecting other people’s love right now."
 

 
Even though he didn’t want to turn into a dog again, Wei Zekai still remembered his duties as the Judge.
 

 
And that night, the scene of Zhong Muxi self-harming in the kitchen...
 

 
That was someone unrelated to him, but he really didn’t want to see another tragedy.
 

 
[Alright, that's quite pure.]
 

 
[If it weren't for the fact that instinctive variety shows can’t fake things, I'd suspect this is a rich kid playing a character.]
 

 
[Wuwuwu, the cold and ruthless swordsman just wants to protect others' love. Is this setting making you ship him?]
 

 
The director zoomed in on Tong Zhao.
 

 
You could see her lips twitch slightly after hearing that, on the verge of smiling but also a bit shocked.
 

 
Clearly, she was unimpressed by such idealistic talk about “protecting others' love.”
 

 
As viewers watched, they realized that the down-to-earth Tong Zhao was a bit mischievous.
 

 
Somewhat unkind but not over the top.
 

 
Far more interesting than the flat, clichéd characters in traditional variety shows.
 

 
After an afternoon of gaming, the two of them had become an unbeatable team and collected many stars. However, Tong Zhao felt that advancing her strategy with Wei Zekai was still a long way off. The director appropriately revealed the affection ratings between them:
 

 
Wei Zekai’s affection for Tong Zhao was at 70%, with the note: “He already considers you a reliable ally!”
 

 
Tong Zhao’s affection for Wei Zekai had dropped to 30%, with the note: “An incomprehensible single-celled organism, should stay single forever.”
 

 
The viewers were in stitches.
 

 
It seemed even the "Sea King" had hit a snag!
 

 
[The feelings are there, but if you ask what kind of feelings, I’d say it’s a friendship bond.]
 

 
[Hahaha, poor Tong Zhao, I want to see how the strategy with Han Zhi is progressing.]
 

 
There wasn't much eye-catching progress on Han Zhi's side.
 

 
However, his solo cut had the highest purchase rate among the six guests, even surpassing Tong Zhao.
 

 
The reason was simple: he was accompanying Chang Xiaonian in playing a romance game.
 

 
As long as fans paid to become premium members and got Chang Xiaonian's first-person perspective, it was practically like dating Han Zhi. No female fan could resist this kind of temptation! Except for kissing, everything else was included—hand-holding, hugging, and Han Zhi always found new ways to make her happy, fulfilling all her romantic fantasies from romance novels.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t require her to keep their relationship a secret, but she still kept quiet about it.
 

 
She didn’t want him to dislike her or cause him any trouble.
 

 
But there was one thing...
 

 
“Han Zhi, your remaining tasks should be pursuing Xiao Xi and Tong Zhao, right?” Chang Xiaonian asked out of the blue while playing board games in the game room. She actually knew the answer but still wanted to ask.
 

 
Perhaps immersed in the sweet and happy atmosphere, Chang Xiaonian no longer referred to Tong Zhao as “that woman.”
 

 
She seemed to have lost her previous resentment towards others.
 

 
Even though she knew that her relationship with Han Zhi was temporary and had a time limit, she didn’t grow to love him more. Instead, she felt better about herself. Han Zhi looked at her with admiration—if such a handsome guy thought she was great, why should anyone else think otherwise? She believed she would meet the right person and deserved all the tenderness.
 

 
In the past, Chang Xiaonian’s view of others was very black and white, like in those face-slapping novels.
 

 
Showing various favors to men was seen as being a green tea bitch.
 

 
He Shun was a typical straight man.
 

 
Wei Zekai was an arrogant, overbearing rich second-generation.
 

 
Han Zhi? He must be the kind of guy who knows how to play the game well and is a scumbag everyone should avoid.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian first spent time alone with Han Zhi, she had placed herself in a very low position...
 

 
But now things were different.
 

 
"Hmm," Han Zhi said, grabbing her hand as she was shuffling the cards. "Since you keep bringing up other girls, I'll punish you by holding my hand for a minute."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian smiled brightly, intertwining her fingers with his, and said with a tone of concern, "If you keep talking about other girls, you could increase the punishment. How about holding hands for half an hour? I don’t know Tong Zhao well, so I’m not worried about her. As for Xiao Xi, she was dumped by a scumbag before, and... I saw an old scar on her wrist, which might indicate she has a tendency for self-harm. I’m not good at comforting people, and we only see each other occasionally at events. If you’re interested in pursuing her, could you be a bit nicer to her? I think you could make her happy."
 

 
She was very clear that a man like Han Zhi was beyond her control.
 

 
Having a period of time with good memories was already a blessing.
 

 
Moreover, she did indeed hope for a genuine romantic relationship.
 

 
"Let’s end our relationship here. I can’t wait to use the methods you taught me to love someone else," Chang Xiaonian said frankly, treating him as a tool.
 

 
Han Zhi wasn’t annoyed. In fact, he was quite pleased that she was speaking openly to him.
 

 
However...
 

 
The dynamics of dominance and submission still needed to be managed carefully.
 

 
He gently lifted their clasped hands, placed a kiss on her wrist, and glanced at her, his perfectly sculpted nose brushing against the back of her hand. “Don’t you want me anymore?”
 

 
“……”
 

 
The young woman was immediately flustered and overwhelmed.
 

 
After her face reddened and she calmed down a bit, it was half an hour later.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian, having made her decision, left with a big smile, making Han Zhi feel even more like junk food—something not to be overindulged in but which brings a smile when consumed. As he thought this, he began to clean up the remnants of their game.
 

 
Just as he was tidying up the board game toys, he heard the sound of the door opening behind him.
 

 
“How surprising,”
 

 
came Tong Zhao’s lazy voice. “She didn’t cry and run away?”
 

 
“I don’t like making girls cry.”
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t turn around, knowing she would approach.
 

 
Sure enough, he heard the footsteps getting closer.
 

 
“Wow, a scumbag who doesn’t like making girls cry, sounds like you have some principles,” Tong Zhao sneered and walked up behind him, seeing the board game "Operation Code" on the table, revealing a bored expression. “Is this what you bring girls on dates to play?”
 

 
“There are other games. Do you want to try? There’s a queue.” Han Zhi still didn’t turn around, his tone a bit indifferent.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pair of slightly cool, soft hands wrapped around his neck from behind, lifting his chin to make him face her directly.
 

 
“I have things I dislike doing and things I enjoy doing,”
 

 
She said, her charming face holding up under this hellish angle. Han Zhi saw her eyes crescent-shaped with mischievousness, clearly a bad woman. His expression remained neutral, but his usually warm face turned unusually cold and distant, indicating that Tong Zhao’s mention of other girls had touched a sensitive spot.
 

 
However, Tong Zhao didn’t care at all.
 

 
Not only did she want to step on his sensitive spot, but she also wanted to dance on it with unrestrained joy.
 

 
“First, I hate waiting in line, so I’m going to cut the queue.”
 

 
“Second, unlike you, I actually enjoy making men cry.”
# Chapter45
In East Asian cultural environments, male tears are often suppressed.
 

 
Men's tears are rarely shed, and men are expected to bleed without crying…
 

 
It all sounds quite tragic for men, but it also creates a certain appeal— the more they resist showing vulnerability, the more one wants to peel away their strong facade, to see their genuine emotions. In the moment of their collapse, to kiss their tears, accept their sharp edges, and embrace their weakness.
 

 
With her delicate hand, Tong Zhao gently caressed Han Zhi's chin, her mind filled with an unspoken dark amusement.
 

 
In the close-up, her fingertips lightly traced over his Adam's apple.
 

 
[Ugh, Tong Zhao really has the face of an Omega with the demeanor of an Alpha.]
 

 
[Male viewers might be confused—what is an Alpha?]
 

 
[For the male viewers up front, don’t leave. I’ve got a file on the topic to discuss with you…]
 

 
Han Zhi grasped her wrist and lifted his eyelids, looking at her with an expressionless face.
 

 
His eyes, hidden behind his lashes, were deep and intense, as if they might pull someone in, never to return.
 

 
“Want to make me cry? That’s a bit of a challenge.”
 

 
She touched his cervical vertebra.
 

 
The bone, connected to the muscles, held a latent explosive strength like a leopard. Her cool fingertips traced over his muscle lines, which were all describable parts, yet the atmosphere between them was rapidly approaching an unbroadcastable red line: “What about your gentlemanly conduct towards women? Come on, cry for me.”
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled with a provocative and unruly attitude.
 

 
Han Zhi found himself somewhat at a loss with this type of behavior, feeling as if he had missed a step. It was a mix of reluctance and anger—why was she so domineering with him? However, his tolerance for women was particularly high. He took the opportunity to pull her into his lap and kissed her ear: “Stop messing around… If I cried, it wouldn’t be anything special. ‘Pear blossoms bring rain’ is used to describe women, right? You’d definitely look better crying than I would.”
 

 
“That’s true.”
 

 
Tong Zhao agreed.
 

 
She herself had used fake crying to achieve her goals before.
 

 
Once she was seated in his lap, the audience began anticipating more risqué scenes.
 

 
However, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, they exchanged information.
 

 
“I know you won’t reveal other girls’ private matters, but it seems you’ve taken care of Chang Xiaonian,” Tong Zhao said confidently, leaving him no room to refute. Han Zhi silently looked at her, knowing that explaining wouldn’t help, and indeed, her statement was true: “So, you’ll need to win me over.”
 

 
Although it wasn’t explicitly stated, both were aware of each other's Sea King cards.
 

 
Similar to games like "Werewolf" and "Blackout", recognizing identities wasn’t the end of the game. Their interests didn’t conflict but instead had the potential for a win-win situation. He needed Tong Zhao’s decisive choice, and she equally needed his.
 

 
The most likely outcome was that they would exchange contact details, with mutual selection leading to the successful completion of their tasks.
 

 
Han Zhi could have pushed back at this moment.
 

 
But he smiled, his expression gentle as he let her lead, appearing as if he was at her mercy: “My Queen?”
 

 
“...Ah, so tacky,” Tong Zhao pinched his perfectly straight nose. “Are you deliberately hitting my sore spots? Scumbag.”
 

 
“Wronged, Master.”
 

 
The more he called her names, the more excessive it became. Han Zhi couldn’t help but laugh, rubbing against her neck like a big dog.
 

 
Tong Zhao knew him too well. He wasn’t even remotely like a canine. While wolves understand the need to obey the alpha, this man, under his obedient facade, had a heart as restless and wandering as a stray. If he were to be described, he’d be like a wild leopard that’s hard to tame—comes around for food and then runs off quickly when uninterested. Infuriatingly so, yet he had such a stunning coat and an endearing voice.
 

 
At that moment, she heard unusual noises coming from the game room door.
 

 
But her attention was quickly drawn back by Han Zhi.
 

 
“Let’s talk about your situation,”
 

 
Han Zhi noticed a small, particularly cute mole on her neck: “How are things with that young master? He doesn’t seem to be a match for you.”
 

 
...
 

 
It was exactly the wrong topic to bring up. Tong Zhao wanted to roll her eyes at him.
 

 
But she held it in.
 

 
Wei Zekai was the most stereotypical straight man she’d ever met, as if he hadn’t fully awakened to his secondary sexual characteristics. Under his handsome face was only a straightforward life of enjoyment—no romance involved. But she didn’t want to lose face in front of her peers, so she took the opportunity, while he was focused on her neck and couldn’t see her expression, to sigh deliberately: “What’s he playing at? He’s such an innocent kid who can’t handle the game. He’s quite cute. I plan to have a serious talk with him.”
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been examining the mole on her neck, was stunned by her words: “...A serious talk?”
 

 
It was as if he had heard some urban legend.
 

 
“Yeah, I like him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao said openly, and when she saw him trying to lift his head to look at her, she quickly rubbed her face against his cheek: “It’s the first time I’ve met this type, and I really like him. I have to treat him well.”
 

 
This statement couldn’t be called half-truth; it was pure nonsense.
 

 
However, with someone like Han Zhi, it’s hard to discern the truth from lies when he can’t see someone’s face. Tong Zhao’s voice was sweet and enchanting, making it difficult for him to make a correct judgment. Moreover, he had to admit... Wei Zekai did have a pretty impressive appearance.
 

 
He couldn’t help but ask: “You really like that type?”
 

 
“Never tried it before.”
 

 
This answer was highly credible to the King of Sea, immediately convincing Han Zhi.
 

 
He bit her neck as if in frustration: “Have you tried my type?”
 

 
[He’s getting anxious!]
 

 
[Unexpectedly, Tong Zhao’s accidental advantage turned out to be superior; she’s ahead this time!]
 

 
[I’d call Wei Zekai the ultimate tool man!]
 

 
The audience felt it, and Tong Zhao naturally picked up on the subtle details in Han Zhi’s tone.
 

 
Although he quickly masked his displeasure in the subsequent conversation, as if nothing had happened, Tong Zhao knew very well. In high-stakes situations, even the tiniest flaw can lead to a total loss. She had only intended to cover up her inability to handle Wei Zekai, but it unexpectedly stirred up Han Zhi’s jealousy.
 

 
So, he can be jealous too?
 

 
It was a bit cute, and the speed at which he suppressed that emotion was quite amusing.
 

 
After catching his little slip, Tong Zhao couldn’t help but smile with a touch of schadenfreude.
 

 
Is jealousy a sign of affection?
 

 
Not necessarily, but at least it indicates a bit of interest. Tong Zhao completely believed in his self-control, but it was like taking a kill from a strong opponent—it was worth celebrating. She felt a great sense of accomplishment, almost wanting to flip this big leopard over and play with its snowy white belly.
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at him sideways: “Caught red-handed, huh? Do you really like me that much?”
 

 
“You…”
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at her mischievous smile and knew exactly what she was thinking.
 

 
It was impossible to make her stop, so he could only helplessly laugh and hug her: “What’s the next development supposed to be? Director Tong, give me some guidance. Are we heading to the 'chasing wife cremation ground'? I haven’t chased anyone before. Teach me, and cut me some slack.”
 

 
“‘Chasing wife cremation ground,’ seriously.”
 

 
Tong Zhao laughed heartily.
 

 
She couldn’t understand why this guy had so many words that hit her sore spots!
 

 
Han Zhi, defending himself after listening to her complaints, said with justification: “Because I’m a writer.”
 

 
“Well, the Chinese literary world is fortunate to have you. It’ll be doomed sooner or later.”
 

 
Tong Zhao issued a dismal missive to the literary world.
 

 
Han Zhi thought this woman was great in every way except for her foul mouth. Deciding to take action, he lowered his head and kissed her lips. The kiss was intense and hard to part from, but at that moment, the director switched the camera.
 

 
[……Director, no more chicken legs for you tonight!]
 

 
[Where’s the director’s Weibo? Everyone, flood it with complaints!]
 

 
[Reasonably suspecting this is a scam to get VIP members to buy the cut version viewing rights. You think we’ll fall for it? Others might not know, but I’ve been duped. Crying while recharging for this King of Sea couple/Smile/Smile]
 

 
The camera cut to just outside the game room, where they encountered He Shun.
 

 
“Tong Zhao, are you avoiding me?”
 

 
He quickly stepped forward, grabbing Tong Zhao's hand with a voice full of confusion and anxiety.
 

 
The audience, who had been angrily cursing the director, instantly had their attention diverted—
 

 
This was definitely a chaotic scene!
 

 
Had things gone off the rails?
 

 
How would Tong Zhao handle it?
 

 
Tong Zhao glanced at her captured wrist. Although she didn’t struggle to provoke him, her inner voice was already cursing him out: [Crazy. Why not just talk if you want to? Why grab me?]
 

 
The production team remained unmoved and even found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
With Han Zhi’s previous example, the crew had already realized that ordinary people couldn’t handle these two sea kings. A few words were enough to appease them, almost at a level of brainwashing worthy of a multi-level marketing leader. If their views weren’t so warped, developing a harem might not be out of the question.
 

 
Assistant director: “The highlight should be the sea kings teaching how to establish a harem, right?”
 

 
“He Shun is no match for Tong Zhao.”
 

 
“It’s hard to say. He Shun is obviously a very possessive man. Chang Xiao Nian has gained confidence and self-awareness under Han Zhi’s influence, and her infatuation with him has faded. This allows her to remain calm about his pursuit of other female players,” the screenwriter analyzed, convincing others.
 

 
Just as everyone behind the scenes and the audience were convinced that Tong Zhao could easily handle He Shun, she did not resort to her usual tactics of softening, acting cute, or feigning distress. Instead, she narrowed her eyes coldly and said, “Avoid you?”
 

 
He Shun did not notice her unusual expression and questioned her with a sense of righteous indignation: “You haven’t talked to me since the end of the class. I wanted to find you, but you were always with that rich young man. I didn’t have a chance to talk to you. If it weren’t for following you... never mind, that’s not the point. You owe me an explanation. Also, what were you doing in the game room with him?”
 

 
Before their relationship was defined, He Shun had already shown a strong sense of control over his “little girlfriend.”
 

 
Having tidied up the board game toys and preparing to leave, Han Zhi was called out just as he was about to step out the door. His handsome face showed an awkward expression, like he’d stepped on his tail, which was quite amusing.
 

 
The camera pulled back, capturing all three of them in the frame, creating a scene reminiscent of an idol drama’s chaotic moment.
 

 
Han Zhi: [Ah, this...]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Let's observe for now. If there’s any violent behavior, I’ll need to protect the queen.]
 

 
[So good at acting, Brother Zhi!]
 

 
[I think he just wants to annoy Sister Zhao. Clearly, she doesn’t like being called 'queen' by him, haha...]
 

 
[These two are hilarious, jumping from a restricted scene straight into a comedy.]
 

 
Han Zhi: [Sigh, I hope Tong Zhao performs normally and I don’t have to step in.]
 

 
Immediately, Tong Zhao took action to show him that not only was she performing well, but she was also exceeding expectations.
 

 
She looked at He Shun with a calm demeanor, a mix of novelty and pity.
 

 
Tong Zhao chuckled lightly.
 

 
"Do you think you’re worthy to boss me around?"
 

 
This was the first time Tong Zhao’s thoughts and spoken words matched in their cold and arrogant tone.
 

 
He Shun clearly didn’t expect this side of his delicate and fragile goddess, and he was left stunned by her previously obsequious and now contemptuous attitude. Tong Zhao observed his expression for a moment—
 

 
She and Han Zhi were clearly not on the same path. Han Zhi would never treat his suitors like this, and as for the imperial concubine? Apart from being the supreme ruler, everyone else was only fit to kneel and serve her: "Alright, for humanitarian reasons, I’ll let you die understanding the truth. I’m already fed up with your self-praise while tutoring students and your visible disdain for women. Every time you criticize those two women, I almost throw up."
 

 
"But," He Shun struggled to accept, "I was just speaking the truth."
 

 
"Ah, consider this a free lesson from me. Listening to you is like putting money in your pocket. Criticizing other women in front of your beloved? Do you think I’d be pleased? No, I’d just think you’re of low class."
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t have much liking for the other two female players either.
 

 
The "true self" of Concubine Chen had always been forged in the palace’s fierce struggles, with competitors of the same sex deeply ingrained in her subconscious. This was her extreme and one-sided part. But for someone like He Shun…
 

 
What to say?
 

 
It was like a eunuch pointing fingers at the concubines—no matter if the target was just an occasional attendant, the concubine still wanted to give him a good kick, sending him to the torture chamber; it was a matter of principle.
 

 
Taking advantage of He Shun’s shock, Tong Zhao freed her wrist from his grip and rubbed her delicate white wrist.
 

 
She had basically concluded that Wei Zekai was the judge, and at worst, someone with the last name Chang or Zhong, though it was unlikely. If it were Chang Xiaonian’s doing, she probably would have reported her name in the app by now. Based on her observations over the past few days, He Shun’s behavior didn’t seem like that of someone holding a special identity card.
 

 
“Do you remember what you said to me? Chang Xiaonian’s desire to marry into a rich family is too obvious; no man would like such a materialistic woman. Zhong Muxi’s looks are average and too gloomy, and at her age, she should be doing more housework to show herself, otherwise, she’ll waste her whole life.”
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao paused: [Does saying this make it seem like I’m venting on their behalf?]
 

 
This thought hit her sore spot, causing goosebumps to rise on her arm.
 

 
[Imagining Concubine Chen defending her sisters in the harem hahahaha]
 

 
[ Let me touch her face!]
 

 
[Director: The character setting has collapsed!]
 

 
Never mind how others interpret it. Seeing the men’s worldviews crumbling, she couldn’t help but mock him with a delighted expression: “Do you think you can control everything and have already handled me? Let me give you a piece of advice: treating all women as fools will only make you look like a bigger fool.”
 

 
The offensive language was toned down.
 

 
But from Tong Zhao’s tone and expression, the audience perfectly received the message she intended to convey.
 

 
He Shun, realizing he had been fooled, was enraged: “You… you deliberately approached me to mislead me! I treated you so well, and now I will expose you to others. As long as the judge knows your true colors, you’re out of the game!”
 

 
“Yes, indeed,”
 

 
After laying it all out, Tong Zhao’s smile didn’t fade. She took a step forward and asked softly, “So, who do you think will believe you? Is it Wei Zekai, who has climbed to twenty stars with me in duo mode, or those two girls you look down on? Do you really think they haven’t noticed your disdain for them? Fool, playing this kind of game without building good relationships and exchanging information with others, it’s quite laughable.”
 

 
He Shun’s expression stiffened.
 

 
Indeed.
 

 
He looked down on those two women, and their relationship with him was also weak.
 

 
They politely addressed him as ‘Teacher He’ on the surface. During their last event, they almost had a fight. He kindly advised Chang Xiaonian to be more practical and not live in her own world, but she was ungrateful and said it was her own business.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In love, isolating yourself is the worst mistake.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [In tactics, belittle the enemy, but in strategy, respect them... Sigh, though I can’t really criticize him for this. In the realm of same-sex relationships, my connections are either cold or antagonistic.]
 

 
She pouted.
 

 
The comments flooded with female fans expressing their admiration.
 

 
Ah, they really like Sister Zhao!
 

 
He Shun, unable to tolerate it any longer, swung his arm to give her a piece of his mind. Observing from behind, Han Zhi couldn’t stay still and quickly stepped in to block He Shun’s raised hand. Tong Zhao, completely expecting this, sarcastically addressed Han Zhi from behind him: “So you’re getting all worked up just because I hit a nerve? Do you want to fight? I’m sending Han Zhi to handle you!”
 

 
She was almost about to say, “Pikachu, I choose you!”…
 

 
Han Zhi’s lips twitched.
 

 
This woman’s genuinely unpleasant personality always made him unable to suppress a smile.
 

 
Upon seeing Han Zhi, He Shun’s assumptions and suspicions quickly connected.
 

 
His pride and self-esteem wavered as he cursed, “...What a pair of dog-men and women!”
 

 
With that, He Shun shook off Han Zhi’s restraint and stormed out.
 

 
Han Zhi, who had been scolded, turned to the cause of the trouble: “Isn’t it easy to smooth things over with him? Why bother?”
 

 
“Difficult, extremely difficult,” Tong Zhao shook his hand playfully, acting spoiled: “It’s nearly impossible for me to hold back from giving him a scolding. Oh my god, did you see how he came to question me—why should I put up with it? He’s not even my boyfriend and thinks he has any authority over me.”
 

 
Han Zhi nodded in understanding: “Sounds very infuriating.”
 

 
When it comes to infuriating people, Tong Zhao is truly a master at provoking hatred.
 

 
However, Han Zhi strangely had little empathy for men. It was as if he was born to think from a woman’s perspective, only wanting to protect the girls' interests.
 

 
Tong Zhao noticed his skepticism and raised her right hand for him to see: “Look, my wrist is red from where he grabbed me.”
 

 
Indeed, there were red marks on her fair wrist from where He Shun had grabbed her. Her pale skin made the bruises even more conspicuous.
 

 
The Empress had never been subjected to such grievances and immediately showed her displeasure.
 

 
Seeing the girl’s wrist injured, Han Zhi’s already limited sympathy turned into genuine concern for Tong Zhao. He sighed, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to get some medicine.”
 

 
“But you have to cooperate with me in the act,” Tong Zhao pressed on.
 

 
Han Zhi knew she was likely to bruise easily but also recognized she was genuinely upset, so he indulged her: “Alright, as a seasoned actor, I’ll play along with whatever you need.”
 

 
Tong Zhao smiled, pleased with the response.
 

 
At the time, no one expected that this would turn out to be a prophetic statement.
 

 
Returning to the current situation:
 

 
He Shun was furious, his anger making him stomp heavily with each step.
 

 
He had feelings for Tong Zhao, an elevated admiration, slightly pleased by this little beauty’s admiration of him. He enjoyed making her dance around him and was thrilled with even the smallest favors. He had never expected that she was actually deceiving him the entire time!
 

 
He was confident that he would not become prey to the “sea king.”
 

 
It was just a woman’s trick.
 

 
In the presence of an experienced and successful man like him, he could see through such things at a glance.
 

 
Tong Zhao was so well-behaved, unable to hide anything from him, her face easily reddening.
 

 
It was probably that ambitious woman who got the female Sea King card! Unfortunately, he was a man she could never control. The young and impulsive Wei Zekai might have a chance, but He Shun had little regard for Chang Xiaonian.
 

 
However, however...
 

 
He Shun’s mind was in complete disarray.
 

 
Viewers of variety shows instinctively love moments of genuine emotion, whether it involves someone’s misfortune or not. It feels authentic and engaging. It’s like some old American reality shows, which often staged dramatic confrontations and outbursts in front of the camera, airing crass lines that would make educated and respectable people cringe, yet still managed high ratings.
 

 
No matter how civilized the times become, the public’s appetite for drama remains unchanged.
 

 
He Shun walked into the public area of the lounge.
 

 
Wei Zekai was nowhere to be found, and the two girls were watching TV.
 

 
He was somewhat displeased, assuming that Wei Zekai was hiding away to play games again, missing in crucial moments. However, on second thought, having only the two girls was not so bad. They seemed to have always disliked Tong Zhao. He once overheard Chang Xiaonian call Tong Zhao a "green tea."
 

 
He Shun approached them and, with a serious demeanor and a determined tone, made a shocking revelation:
 

 
“Tong Zhao is the sea king among us. She deceived my feelings!”
 

 
……
 

 
………
 

 
Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi, sitting closely on a small sofa, looked up at He Shun.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not talkative, but Chang Xiaonian couldn’t hide her confusion and curiosity: “Huh?”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Are we even that close?]
 

 
Tong Zhao was right; their relationship was not good at all.
 

 
The identity of the female sea king did not threaten the interests of the two girls.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian thought it was rather foolish for a man like He Shun to seek their help to seek justice after being emotionally hurt.
 

 
Not only did she not sympathize, but she also found it somewhat amusing.
 

 
[Doesn’t he look down on women a lot? How can he be deceived by a woman and then seek help from another woman?] Chang Xiaonian’s inner thoughts voiced a portion of the audience’s sentiment: [What does it have to do with me? Help, every time he speaks, it just makes Brother Zhi look even better. I hope my future boyfriend isn’t like this guy, please.]
 

 
If He Shun had arrived a bit earlier, Chang Xiaonian might have shared his antagonism.
 

 
After all, in many black-and-white online novels and short videos, green tea bitches and white lotus flowers are universally condemned.
 

 
However, after receiving Brother Zhi’s care, she had become more forgiving towards flowers and plants. She felt a bit embarrassed about her previous behavior of gossiping behind Tong Zhao’s back. Although she couldn’t apologize directly, at least she didn’t feel the impulse to join in the bashing when others tried to slander Tong Zhao.
 

 
“Don’t you understand this at all?”
 

 
Although He Shun was already aware that women typically react slower than men, he was still a bit impatient: “She intentionally seduced me and then revealed her true colors after I confessed to her…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked with curiosity: “What exactly are these true colors?”
 

 
He Shun, enraged, replied: “She rejected me!”
# Chapter46
Chang Xiaonian mumbled, "... Oh."
 

 
He Shun sighed in relief, "Do you understand now?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian didn't really understand.
 

 
If it were one of her close friends, even if the confession was rejected by a man and she knew everyone had the right to refuse, she would still help her friend by cursing out the guy to let off steam, and only after she calmed down would she offer advice.
 

 
But He Shun...
 

 
He's someone she has no real connection with!
 

 
Moreover, didn't He Shun seem quite confident last time? He told her to be clear-headed, saying that if a girl wants to find a partner, she needs to learn to actively do housework, otherwise, no one would want her, and then he eagerly went to be a tool for Tong Zhao. And now he got rejected? Serves him right for being so narrow-minded!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian had no intention of defending him.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn't catch on as quickly; she seemed a bit slow and continued to be puzzled, "Why is getting rejected a sign of being a sea king? Maybe she just doesn't like you?"
 

 
"She was leading me on and misleading me!"
 

 
Zhong Muxi asked, "What specific actions misled you?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian suddenly remembered that this friend of hers was a science prodigy and also a bit rigid.
 

 
He Shun argued indignantly, "Whatever I did, she praised me and would blush when talking to me."
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [Blushing, what a sophisticated fishing tactic!]
 

 
"Teacher He," Zhong Muxi asked with even more confusion, "I remember you were tutoring her. Isn’t it normal for a student to praise the teacher? As for blushing, that’s just blushing. Is there any more convincing evidence? With the way you spoke just now, I thought she at least mentioned liking you or something similar.”
 

 
[Don’t ask anymore, He Shun is getting anxious.]
 

 
[Is this the power of a straight woman?]
 

 
[I’m already starting to feel embarrassed for He Shun. I hope his business partners don’t see this episode.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi sighed, "If there's no verbal evidence, do you have any actual progress in your relationship? Have you hugged, held hands, or kissed?"
 

 
"No, but..."
 

 
He Shun opened his mouth to argue.
 

 
However, under the barrage of questioning, he not only stuttered but also suddenly realized deep down—
 

 
Yes, Tong Zhao had never made any promises to him.
 

 
Why had he always been so sure that she was interested in him? Moreover, with his experience, he knew that attraction between men and women before establishing a relationship is unreliable; you might be into each other one day and indifferent the next.
 

 
[The empress knows how to see through people’s intentions.]
 

 
[Her previous analysis of He Shun was spot on.]
 

 
Noticing the shift in the comments, the special effects team timely inserted a previous psychological analysis by Tong Zhao regarding He Shun:
 

 
[He Shun is a man overflowing with confidence who looks down on women, believing that women are naturally inferior to him in terms of physiology, psychology, and intelligence. It’s easy to handle someone with this mindset. People who treat others as fools in interpersonal relationships are the most likely to end up with a big fall.]
 

 
[He’s arrogant, so he magnified the feelings I showed.]
 

 
[He looks down on women, so he thinks I can't escape his grasp.]
 

 
[It would be best if he develops a complex about women and stops putting on a show in front of them.]
 

 
The last comment had the audience in stitches.
 

 
At this moment, Han Zhi hurriedly walked into the living room and asked, "Where’s the first aid kit?"
 

 
Chang Xiaonian stood up, "I’ll get it for you. What happened?"
 

 
He Shun’s irritation flared up.
 

 
Just now, when he was talking to Chang Xiaonian, she was cold and indifferent.
 

 
He Shun thought Chang Xiaonian was just pretending to be aloof, as she acted the same way with all men. But then she was so attentive to Han Zhi...
 

 
Recalling how Tong Zhao had shown off behind Han Zhi, He Shun was consumed with jealousy: “Now you’re just her lapdog? I’m telling you, that woman isn’t so simple. Don’t let yourself be used without even realizing it.”
 

 
[Although you’re confident when pointing fingers at girls, your powerless rage looks really pathetic.]
 

 
[I love the literary genius of the comments.]
 

 
[Handsome men and beautiful women are a match made in heaven, and it’s ridiculous for you to oppose it!]
 

 
After finding the first aid kit, Han Zhi finally looked at He Shun, his eyes cold and frosty:
 

 
"Just because she rejected your confession, you want to resort to violence? If helping her find medicine is exploitation, then I’m willing to do it."
 

 
Wei Zekai, who had just finished playing a game and came out to watch, heard this and asked, "Who got hurt?"
 

 
"I saw He Shun confessing to Tong Zhao in the hallway. After she rejected him, he wouldn’t let her leave, and her wrist ended up with a large bruise."
 

 
Han Zhi spoke clearly and logically. He generally got along well with everyone, and even Zhong Muxi, who was most resistant to men, thought he was a good man. When he spoke, the scales of reason naturally tipped in his favor.
 

 
"I didn’t lay a hand on her!"
 

 
He Shun denied it.
 

 
As soon as he finished speaking, a pale-faced Tong Zhao walked out from the hallway leading to the game room.
 

 
It was unclear how she managed to make her face look so pale.
 

 
Earlier, when she had been mocking He Shun, her complexion was rosy and healthy, as if she had had a little to drink.
 

 
Han Zhi ignored his explanation. After Tong Zhao sat down on the sofa farthest from He Shun, he took out some ointment and applied it to her. Everyone could clearly see that there was a red mark on Tong Zhao’s wrist, evidently caused by someone grabbing her too hard.
 

 
He Shun’s face instantly turned dark.
 

 
He had indeed held her hand for a while...
 

 
But was it really that hard?
 

 
He wasn’t sure.
 

 
Tong Zhao, who looked delicate and used to pretending to be pitiful, now sat quietly on the sofa with her long lashes casting shadows over her bright eyes. She lowered her head, exposing a slender, pale neck that, like her arms and legs, seemed fragile and easy to break. Honestly, when she was quiet, she fit the straight male fantasy of pure and weak, easily controllable.
 

 
She was so beautiful and delicate, like a porcelain doll, that it evoked a flood of sympathy from the audience who were fans of attractive people.
 

 
Even Chang Xiaonian, who generally had a neutral opinion of Tong Zhao, couldn’t hold back: “Acting out after a failed confession, you’re the one revealing your true colors!”
 

 
He Shun’s lack of communication skills was glaringly exposed.
 

 
The director displayed the approval panel; He Shun’s approval rating had dropped to only 10.
 

 
It was roughly at the level of “if something bad happened to him, people might still send flowers in sympathy, but they don’t want to interact with him any further and find him annoying.”
 

 
He Shun’s disdain for others didn’t mean he wanted to be a public figure.
 

 
Feeling the strange looks from everyone, he anxiously explained, “I was just so angry at the time, and I didn’t hit her. I was just afraid she would run away and not listen to me properly. It wasn’t that serious! Right, it must be fake, like with blush or lipstick…”
 

 
[Next, He Shun will perform a segment of “The More You Explain, The Worse It Gets.”]
 

 
[Will he really find a girlfriend after this show airs? Just asking.]
 

 
[Maybe. I’ve heard he’s quite wealthy and not bad-looking among rich people.]
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at him, poured more ointment, and applied it to the wound.
 

 
There was no sign of the bruise spreading.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian: [His understanding of women is shockingly shallow and stereotypical.]
 

 
Zhong Muxi: [I need to stay away from him in the future.]
 

 
“Did you hurt your hand? Is it serious?” Wei Zekai ran down the stairs from the second floor, squatted beside Tong Zhao, and examined her injury with concern. This action surprised the audience, especially the two playboys and added weight to the notion that “Tong Zhao genuinely likes him,” which annoyed Han Zhi a bit.
 

 
[Wei Zekai is awakening? The Wei-Zhao faction is ecstatic!]
 

 
[Not bad, the younger brother is making progress.]
 

 
However, the AI's analysis quickly shattered the audience’s illusions:
 

 
Wei Zekai: [Injured your hand? Will it affect your performance? Damn, He’s caused a lot of harm.]
 

 
[………]
 

 
[……………]
 

 
The comments were filled with ellipses.
 

 
Wei Zekai, a man who silenced the comments!
 

 
Seeing his malicious assumptions crumble on their own, He Shun became increasingly flustered in his defense: “Why are you all looking at me like that? I didn’t do it on purpose. How was I supposed to know she was so fragile? I swear I really didn’t mean to hurt her. If I had intended to, it wouldn’t just be a bruise on her wrist. Can I just apologize? I’m sorry!”
 

 
As he spoke, He Shun became more agitated.
 

 
He genuinely believed he was in the right.
 

 
The mistake was misjudging Tong Zhao; he didn’t expect her to be such a malicious woman.
 

 
He merely held someone’s hand while talking for a moment, and now it’s his fault that her wrist is bruised? He feels incredibly unlucky.
 

 
He was innocent but fell victim to a bad woman. It’s truly unfortunate.
 

 
People who are arrogant can’t hide their emotions, and his insincere apology only further diminished any goodwill.
 

 
Tong Zhao’s injury was not serious; if He Shun had apologized with a good attitude, people would have calmed down and understood it objectively. But instead, he made things worse by exposing his problematic mindset while trying to explain.
 

 
He genuinely believed that injuring a wrist didn’t count as hitting someone.
 

 
Tong Zhao should be thankful that he didn’t actually intend to hit her.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was fuming.
 

 
But she felt that her relationship with Tong Zhao wasn’t close enough to defend her.
 

 
Wei Zekai, however, couldn’t listen any longer.
 

 
“Are you done yet? Why should Tong Zhao listen to you? If she doesn’t want to hear what you have to say, maybe you should reflect on whether you’re just talking nonsense. Ok, if you want an answer, she rejected you! It’s straightforward and clear. Or do you not understand human language? Do we need to send you a dream to explain it? Fine, if that’s what it takes, people from the underworld can handle such things.”
 

 
Wei Zekai was a young master known for his prowess in various online games.
 

 
Han Zhi didn’t have the face to scold him, but Wei Zekai did so without hesitation.
 

 
If it weren’t for the invisible force (the system tries to prevent guests from saying restricted lines) holding him back, He Shun’s family tree might have already started facing trouble.
 

 
After being berated by someone he viewed as just a pampered kid from a wealthy family, He Shun angrily retorted, “What’s it to you!”
 

 
“You injured her hand, so of course it concerns me!”
 

 
He Shun yelled, but Wei Zekai yelled even louder.
 

 
Han Zhi glanced at Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao already suspected about 50% of the reason behind Wei Zekai’s fury, but to keep up the act, she still showed Han Zhi a somewhat smug smile, resembling a pampered little princess.
 

 
Wei Zekai’s mind was as quick as his speech: [Damn it, Tong Zhao’s hand shouldn’t be hurt. That’s the hand used to coordinate with me to take down the opponents!]
 

 
“What did I say wrong? Are you angry because your confession failed? Didn’t you injure her hand?”
 

 
He Shun thought about it and realized that the young master was probably right.
 

 
“I’m not angry because of embarrassment; I’ve seen through her true nature. I didn’t expect all of you to be deceived by her,” He Shun said with deep disappointment, looking at the two girls. The two men had become nothing more than Tong Zhao’s lapdogs in his eyes. He added another gem of wisdom: “If you want to maintain your dignity, you shouldn’t be on her side. Good girls should draw a clear line from that kind of person!”
 

 
This was clearly stirring up trouble.
 

 
But it was also He Shun’s honest opinion.
 

 
He wasn’t a woman-hater; in fact, he liked and needed women very much.
 

 
But what he liked were good women.
 

 
Tong Zhao had previously been seen by He Shun as the ideal obedient girl, while Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were too lacking in femininity and didn’t satisfy a man’s sense of self-esteem. However, it now seemed that Tong Zhao was the most unforgivable bad woman!
 

 
He hoped the two girls would wake up and realize that they shouldn’t blindly support their own gender.
 

 
Just like those women who say, “Although I’m a woman too, I think blabla…”—that’s the kind of clear-headed and sensible girl in his eyes.
 

 
Such a classic idea that can provoke gender conflicts was fully displayed to the audience.
 

 
Reality shows are just this authentic.
 

 
The more controversial the topic, the fewer celebrities are willing to appear on the show.
 

 
The same goes for ordinary people.
 

 
Fortunately, there are many people in China, so with such a large pool, it’s always possible to find suitable guests.
 

 
He Shun thought his subconscious must be as mature and wise as he is, full of male charm.
 

 
He didn’t think he would cause any public relations crisis—
 

 
After all, his views and thoughts are in line with mainstream society.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was a bit overwhelmed by being yelled at by a man and moved closer to her friend.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian glanced at him disdainfully: “Crazy.”
 

 
After saying that, she dragged her friend upstairs, clearly unwilling to get involved.
 

 
With Young Master Wei Zekai protecting her, there was no need for them to rush to defend Tong Zhao. However, He Shun’s irritating nature was fully displayed. They decided to avoid him in the future to prevent him from “accidentally” bruising someone’s hand because he wanted them to stop and listen to him.
 

 
After He Shun threw his tantrum and was ignored, he left in a huff.
 

 
Han Zhi finished applying the ointment, confirmed that Tong Zhao didn’t need anything else, and then left.
 

 
Wei Zekai felt sorry for his teammate and sat down next to her to comfort her: “Does your hand still hurt?”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her eyes and spoke softly: “A little.”
 

 
“I see,” Wei Zekai said with great concern, “Does that mean you can’t play games?”
 

 
Tong Zhao: “…”
 

 
She had guessed correctly.
 

 
So the guy’s anger earlier was because his duo queue partner was out of commission.
 

 
If Tong Zhao were a guy, she’d be fine now, but his heart would be aching.
 

 
Who wouldn’t have a tough time trying to win over Wei Zekai’s heart?
 

 
Tong Zhao: [Retreating in the face of difficulty doesn’t fit my aesthetics. Go for it, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
Tong Zhao pouted: “You only care about the game, and I’m not important at all?”
 

 
“How could that be?”
 

 
Wei Zekai couldn’t stand being misunderstood.
 

 
He suddenly placed his hands on her shoulders, looked intently into her eyes, and said:
 

 
“You’re an important teammate to me!”
 

 
Tong Zhao: [……]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [I can’t keep this up. Just let it be destroyed!]
 

 
Tong Zhao steadied herself and gathered her thoughts.
 

 
Wei Zekai, being a young guy, needed a gradual approach. She couldn’t be too hasty: “You can play games. It doesn’t affect anything. Do you want to play now? We can go to your room.”
 

 
“My room?” Wei Zekai was puzzled.
 

 
“I’m afraid of seeing him.”
 

 
Tong Zhao lowered her head, looking like an adorable, aggrieved little thing.
 

 
Wei Zekai understood and accepted the suggestion to go to his room, and he patted his chest, reassuring her: “Don’t worry, with me around, that old man wouldn’t dare lay a finger on you!”
 

 
Tong Zhao realized he wasn’t impressed by being admired, so she skipped the grateful look.
 

 
This fool, it’s already good enough that she didn’t give him a disdainful glance.
 

 
※
 

 
When they arrived at the estate, Wei Zekai, the super-rich second-generation who had criticized the shabby estate, had no qualms about choosing the best suite. Although Tong Zhao didn’t look around, she had quietly observed with her peripheral vision and indeed noticed some clues.
 

 
The dog hair left on the floor was clearly from that little dog.
 

 
“Your room seems bigger than mine. Is the bedroom the same?”
 

 
“Why don’t you go check?”
 

 
Each suite had its own small living room, bathroom, and bedroom.
 

 
With the owner’s permission, Tong Zhao glanced into the bedroom and indeed found noticeable golden-brown dog hair on the white bed sheets.
 

 
“I’ll go wash my face and clear my head,” Tong Zhao said.
 

 
Wei Zekai, sprawling out on the living room sofa, nodded to show he heard her.
 

 
The bathroom also had traces of dog hair.
 

 
Not having a dog was indeed a lie from Wei Zekai.
 

 
But there were no sounds of dogs in the room—
 

 
Unless specially trained, it’s rare for dogs not to bark when a stranger enters the room. At least for small dogs, their tolerance in this aspect… maybe it’s Tong Zhao’s prejudice, but having been barked at by Pomeranians and Chihuahuas before, she thought corgis couldn’t control themselves.
 

 
An immature idea gradually took shape in Tong Zhao's mind.
 

 
As usual, she played games with Kai Wei, but her frequency of speaking was much higher than before.
 

 
“Where is their jungler?”
 

 
“He should be taking his own red buff.”
 

 
“What skills did the enemy use in the last team fight?”
 

 
“The ADC used Cleanse.”
 

 
……
 

 
Tong Zhao’s questions weren’t complicated, some were simple enough to answer without much thought.
 

 
With the continuous high frequency of questions, Wei Zekai gradually developed a reflexive response.
 

 
Finally, when the timing seemed right, Tong Zhao asked, “What about that little dog?”
 
“It’s playing the game with you.”
 
……
 

 
[Psychology Master, I bow to your wisdom!]
 

 
[Seriously? This works? Is Wei Zekai’s IQ all used up for playing games?]
 

 
[Impressed by the devotion, haha]
 

 
Tong Zhao subconsciously felt that this tactic was effective on him.
 

 
It definitely wouldn’t work on Han Zhi.
 

 
After hearing the answer, Tong Zhao fell silent.
 

 
Realizing what he had said, Wei Zekai's hand shook, not only did he misfire his ultimate, but he also inadvertently punished the ADC’s cannon, receiving a frustrated question mark from the ADC: “Damn, I didn’t hear clearly just now. What dog? I don’t know… Hey, can you control the enemy mid-laner? They keep messing around in my jungle!”
 

 
Tong Zhao didn’t press the issue any further.
 

 
She had a premonition that, given Wei Zekai’s thought process, the real reason behind things might be much stranger than she imagined.
 

 
For this private gathering, Tong Zhao's progress: She reached six stars in the game.
 

 
Meanwhile, Chang Xiaonian and Zhong Muxi were discussing the afternoon’s incident with a sigh.
 

 
“Even if Tong Zhao really is a sea king… I suspect she has a lot to do with it. After all, Xiao Xi, you’re not, and I’m not, so it must be her!” Chang Xiaonian analyzed confidently, “Anyway, it’s not our business. That guy He Shun’s behavior is just too ugly. He deserves to be played around with; hitting a woman is simply unforgivable!”
 

 
Zhong Muxi, hugging a pillow, softly agreed: “I don’t like He Shun.”
 

 
Seeing Han Zhi defend Tong Zhao made Chang Xiaonian feel a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
But then she realized it was just part of the official task.
 

 
Zhong Muxi worriedly asked her: “By the way, are you okay? It seems like Wei Zekai has a good relationship with Tong Zhao…”
 

 
She knew her close friend had always been fond of Wei Zekai.
 

 
Whether it was for money or if she was materialistic was not something she considered.
 

 
She was concerned about her friend's feelings.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was taken aback but then waved her hand: “I’ve long stopped liking him! This time I’m not getting involved in the activity, but I’m quite happy.”
 

 
Even though she hadn’t found a suitable partner, she had experienced a sweet and dreamy romance.
 

 
She was very satisfied!
 

 
“That’s good.” Zhong Muxi felt relieved.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian looked at her friend intently.
 

 
In theory, she should remind her that Han Zhi is that sea king.
 

 
But considering Zhong Muxi’s many old injuries…
 

 
Recently, she had been keeping a close eye on her, eating and sleeping together. When Xiao Xi lost control of her emotions, she would cry on her shoulder, which helped control her self-harming urges. But she couldn’t be with her forever… Maybe Han Zhi could do what she couldn’t.
 

 
Forget it, let’s observe for now.
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi were like parallel lines; aside from being forced together during a game of Truth or Dare, they had no intersecting points.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was quite curious about how he would make his move.
 

 
But he seemed unaffected.
 

 
And in this estate, there was someone else who was also concerned about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
It wasn’t Han Zhi, it was Wei Zekai.
 

 
He had vowed to stop being a lapdog, but he continued to pay attention to the crying, self-harming girl. He thought if something similar happened again, he’d swoop in and take away her fruit knife—he had practiced jumping many times in his room for this, truly an elite among dogs.
 

 
After He Shun was isolated, the atmosphere in the estate became a bit strange.
 

 
People with sensitive and fragile mental states are most easily affected. Although it wasn’t Zhong Muxi’s fault, her condition continued to deteriorate day by day. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t do much about it and had to leave it to Han Zhi to figure out a solution.
 

 
Han Zhi was surprised: “You’re creating opportunities for me to pursue your friend?”
 

 
“To make her happy,” Chang Xiaonian corrected him, “I’m involved too, so don’t mess things up.”
 

 
Han Zhi was a bit surprised, then touched her head: “Why does it seem like you’re doing better and better after leaving me?”
 

 
“It’s always been this way; it’s too late to regret now.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian accepted his praise calmly and hummed a happy tune.
 

 
Under her matchmaking, the three of them frequently spent time together.
 

 
He Shun saw this and felt he had once again misjudged— not only was Tong Zhao a schemer, but even Han Zhi, who he had thought well of before, was just another pretty boy spinning around women. And those two girls were even more foolish.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was surprised that Han Zhi didn’t enjoy having two women accompany him as much as He Shun imagined.
 

 
He came up with some entertainment activities but invited Wei Zekai and Tong Zhao to join.
 

 
Under the condition of “mutual support,” Tong Zhao reluctantly attended.
 

 
Han Zhi’s strategy was effective; Zhong Muxi’s smile gradually increased.
 

 
One time, after swimming in the pool and feeling tired, the three girls sat by the poolside, sipping on the frozen juice Han Zhi had prepared in advance, and chatted idly. Zhong Muxi said enviously, “Han Zhi is amazing, he has everything prepared. I’m almost embarrassed.”
 

 
“What’s there to be embarrassed about?”
 

 
The favored concubine, who saw all men as tools, looked at her in confusion.
 

 
Since distancing herself from He Shun’s male chauvinism, Tong Zhao had increasingly revealed her true nature in front of everyone. Her hand, which would never heal, was taken care of by Wei Zekai, who accepted that girls were more delicate and helped her with tea and water, after all, she was an injured comrade, and it was right to take care of her!
 

 
After several gatherings, Chang Xiaonian had a good understanding of what Tong Zhao was like.
 

 
She was basically a princess with a disorder.
 

 
The green tea act was fake, and she didn’t like to speak ill of other girls.
 

 
She looked at Tong Zhao with considerable patience.
 

 
At this point, Tong Zhao belatedly remembered her mission as a supporting role and reluctantly added, “If you’re embarrassed, next time you can prepare things together with him.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian questioned, “What about you?”
 

 
Tong Zhao replied very calmly, “I have a hand injury.”
 

 
After saying that, Tong Zhao flashed a delicate smile.
 

 
Tong Zhao's smile was beautiful, but Chang Xiaonian read the underlying message from it—
 

 
"Expect me to do the work? Not gonna happen."
 

 
How could someone use such a beautiful face to maintain this "I’m too delicate to handle hard work" attitude!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was stunned by her shamelessness.
 

 
For a moment, she was speechless, losing her ability to talk.
 

 
Zhong Muxi didn’t notice the underlying tension in their conversation; she thought Tong Zhao had a point.
 

 
Although she didn’t want to be a caretaker for men, she was willing to join in on the preparations. She vaguely sensed that these gatherings were arranged for her, and she felt grateful but also wanted to contribute something for everyone.
 

 
[Oh no, Xiao Xi is such a good girl, Brother Zhi, go save her!]
 

 
[So obedient...]
 

 
[To spoil the mood, this kind of thinking can easily lead to the favored concubine bossing her around…]
 

 
The audience before the live broadcast fell silent for a moment.
 

 
Everyone has a dark side; even saints acknowledge actions over intentions.
 

 
Instinctive variety shows are all about intentions, so the public is generally more forgiving of guests’ performances as long as they are interesting and engaging! Even in instinctive films, Xu Zhu was criticized not for her selfish nature but for her inability to secure a role and almost derailing the plot by causing a key character's death. She wasn’t condemned to leave the entertainment industry just because of her inherent flaws.
 

 
Tong Zhao's princess syndrome was similarly accepted.
 

 
Of course, some people disliked it, but others found it endearing.
 

 
Anyway, the audience wasn’t the ones being used as tools!
 

 
There were also male viewers willing to be the tool for the beautiful sister.
 

 
And some people even felt vicariously pleased.
 

 
The variety of opinions played out on the screen.
 

 
Before the next gathering, Zhong Muxi indeed proposed joining in on the preparation work, and Han Zhi gladly agreed.
 

 
He also slowly built rapport with Zhong Muxi in his own way—
 

 
Zhong Muxi was like a shy little hedgehog, even more so than Chang Xiaonian, requiring patience.
 

 
He had to take it slow, being a patient hunter.
# Chapter47
The afternoon sunlight gently bathed the grass.
 

 
The well-trimmed lawn was gilded with a layer of gold, beautiful like an oil painting. And Tong Zhao, wearing a straw hat and well-applied sunscreen, was the main character of this oil painting. She was also very aware of her role, and after tasting each of the hot dishes, salads, and desserts her friend had prepared, she began to give her feedback:
 

 
“This sweet and sour spareribs and potato-braised beef brisket are quite good, though the spareribs could be a bit sweeter.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian coolly remarked, “If you want it sweeter, you can make it yourself.”
 

 
“But mine doesn’t taste as good as Muxi’s,” Tong Zhao said, speaking very kindly to the well-trained butler number two, Zhong Muxi. With a soft voice and clasped hands, she pleaded, “Muxi’s cooking is the best. My hands hurt, so I can't hold the pot, and I’ve never learned to cook. Thankfully, you’re here. I wouldn’t know what to do without you.”
 

 
…
 

 
Your hands hurting my foot!
 

 
Chang Xiaonian felt sick just looking at her.
 

 
But with such a pleasant attitude and flattery in every sentence, Zhong Muxi, who had a thin skin, blushed with embarrassment and looked quite pleased. Chang Xiaonian couldn’t say anything more and had to console herself – at least Tong Zhao knew not to be pushy about getting a free ride.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was still naïve.
 

 
When the relationship became truly familiar, the imperial consort could show off with an air of authority.
 

 
Tong Zhao: [The training of a butler is subtle and imperceptible, like a silent influence.]
 

 
Tong Zhao: [At first, they just prepared my portion and received compliments. Then, they were asked to make dishes according to my preferences, and now they know my tastes without me saying anything... Not bad!]
 

 
[I suddenly understand how my cat pua-ed me.]
 

 
[This litter-scooping officer is crying.]
 

 
[Congratulations to Miss Muxi for getting a cat master!]
 

 
[The only sane and normal person on the scene might be Miss Chang…]
 

 
Blushing from the compliments, Zhong Muxi hurriedly lowered her head and said quietly, “If you like it, I’ll add more sugar next time.”
 

 
Humans are social animals.
 

 
Zhong Muxi was not a cold and solitary type. After being abandoned by a man and resisting male company, she craved a sense of security in friendships more than most girls. The pain of being dumped largely comes from being rejected and betrayed by those closest to you, with original hopes and plans torn up and thrown away, leaving the abandoned party helplessly facing memories.
 

 
Tong Zhao provided her with generous and affirming recognition.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian watched her and felt silently sick.
 

 
“Ah, I’m done drinking.” After finishing the last sip of mango juice, Tong Zhao looked dejected.
 

 
“Would you like more mango juice, or should we try something else?”
 

 
Han Zhi and Zhong Muxi had made many freshly squeezed fruit juices and put them in the fridge.
 

 
Tong Zhao: “I’m getting a bit tired of mango juice; I want watermelon juice.”
 

 
Chang Xiaonian took the empty cup to the kitchen to rinse it and set it aside to dry. Then, she took out the watermelon juice from the fridge and, the moment she placed it in front of Tong Zhao, it felt like a jolt in her brain — [Oh no, what am I doing!!!]
 

 
[I can’t be complicit in this!!]
 

 
[Why am I listening to her??? Does she have no hands or feet???]
 

 
“Thank you.”
 

 
Tong Zhao took the watermelon juice with both hands and smiled sweetly at her.
 

 
……
 

 
To be honest, Chang Xiaonian was straightforward and only liked men.
 

 
She liked reading romance novels and watching idol dramas.
 

 
When Tong Zhao was cold towards them, Chang Xiaonian had a negative impression of her.
 

 
However, when Tong Zhao used her tactics for dealing with men to charm and act cute with her —
 

 
The inner voice couldn’t lie: [It’s so annoying. Why does someone have to be so cute when they smile?]
 

 
[……I retract my statement about Miss Chang being the only sane person.]
 

 
[Why hate on "green tea"? It's because the "green tea" isn’t aimed at you. /doge]
 

 
Chang Xiaonian sat down with a wooden expression, struggling to accept her own behavior of switching sides.
 

 
It must have just been a momentary lapse; it doesn’t mean anything…!
 

 
※
 

 
It seemed Zhong Muxi's emotional state had been improving day by day.
 

 
The injuries on her hands had decreased but left varying shades of scars, so she only wore long-sleeved clothes to hide them, even wearing a dark-colored coat when swimming. When alone, she often stared at the wounds on her hands and regretted self-harm.
 

 
Some comments criticized her for not taking care of herself.
 

 
Others showed understanding.
 

 
As an amateur, Zhong Muxi’s solo clips had very few views.
 

 
After all, her life wasn’t very interesting; the only highlight was her interactions with Han Zhi. Han Zhi's fans might as well watch his solo clips instead.
 

 
However, the popular comments under Zhong Muxi’s solo clips received a lot of approval:
 

 
[This is what heartbreak is like. You come to terms with it yesterday, but today you can’t handle it. When you’ve accepted it, you’re as regretful and angry with yourself as you are now. But when overwhelmed by emotions, even breathing feels like a luxury. Even if you no longer love that man, you can’t face the fact that you weren’t chosen.]
 

 
NetEase Cloud has been mocked as "Net Depression Cloud," marking the onset of depression.
 

 
Yet, the large amount of breakup literature and melancholic captions on Douyin proves that there is a corresponding market demand.
 

 
The production team of "Sea King Killer" noticed this and edited some segments of Zhong Muxi with sad background music, promoting them on many marketing accounts and Douyin influencers. This helped the variety show gain more fans. Since other guests continued to show kindness towards her, it healed many viewers, and this positive sentiment also extended to the other guests.
 

 
Except for He Shun, everyone benefited.
 

 
"Romantic Reality Show with Both Drama and Warmth: 'Sea King Killer'"
 

 
"If I had these friends during my breakup, I wouldn’t have collapsed every night."
 

 
"Collapse later; first, make Tong Zhao a plate of sweet and sour ribs.”
 

 
The last post is from a short video:
 

 
Zhong Muxi had insomnia and subconsciously went to the kitchen to harm herself, but she ran into Tong Zhao, who was out for a walk. Tong Zhao ordered her to make a late-night snack — cooking in the middle of the night, with oil smoke everywhere, who would want to do that? However, her attitude was so casual, and Zhong Muxi was in a particularly vulnerable state, so she really put down the fruit knife and made the snack…
 

 
Tong Zhao couldn’t finish it alone, so she pulled Zhong Muxi to sit down and ate a big bowl of rice with sweet and sour ribs.
 

 
The carbs were overwhelming.
 

 
Zhong Muxi ended up with a full belly, dazedly being escorted back to her room.
 

 
When Chang Xiaonian was awakened by the noise, she was still half-asleep. Tong Zhao's meaningful comment, “Take care of your friend,” startled her awake. She quickly pulled Zhong Muxi to wash her face, brush her teeth, and get into bed, making sure to tuck in the corners of the blanket securely before feeling at ease.
 

 
Only the omniscient viewers knew that Tong Zhao was truly a light sleeper.
 

 
Since the little dog incident, she had even moved the sofa to behind the door, sleeping directly behind the door to not miss any noise, determined to catch that dog. The audience was charmed by her relentless spirit, crowning her as the 999th generation leader of the Beggar’s Sect, mastering the art of dog-beating.
 

 
Unfortunately, the little dog never appeared.
 

 
Tong Zhao was increasingly frustrated and more determined.
 

 
In the manor with six people, the five who were grouped together made the one left out feel even worse.
 

 
Previously, He Shun was distant from others, believing he was above them and unable to relate to women and children. It was his choice. But now, others ignored him; even when their eyes met in passing, they would immediately look away. This feeling…
 

 
Was utterly terrible!
 

 
He had exposed Tong Zhao’s true nature under the public eye.
 

 
He didn’t expect that not only was she not ostracized, but her relationships with others also improved — Tong Zhao had previously relied only on him. Observing silently, his mentality began to collapse. He Shun couldn’t accept that he was a failure, a loser in this game. He had not only lost in love but also lost the respect of others.
 

 
And all of this was thanks to Tong Zhao.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t understand more and more, and he really wanted to find someone to voice his grievances.
 

 
Men wouldn’t understand; they were all Tong Zhao’s sycophants.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian was too blunt to empathize with a man’s difficulties.
 

 
That left Zhong Muxi, who was weak and easy to talk to.
 

 
His thoughts were laid bare under the AI scan, and they deeply disgusted the audience.
 

 
[Picking on the weak and fearing the strong, what a real man / like/like]
 

 
[Get lost. What kind of ability is it to target the soft Zhong Muxi? If you have guts, go after Tong Zhao.]
 

 
[Tong Zhao’s sarcasm is at MAX level. If he gets another round, he might never recover / doge]
 

 
Unfortunately, the audience couldn’t influence the development of the show and could only vent their frustration through comments and bullet screens. What’s worse, this episode ended with He Shun’s dark and irritable inner thoughts —
 

 
[I’m an adult; I don’t need you to prevent me from getting obsessed. I want to be obsessed!]
 

 
But it was useless. No matter how anxious he was, he had to wait for the next episode to air.
 

 
Zhong Muxi rarely had moments alone, but He Shun had too much free time. Plus, the production team deliberately arranged for them to meet — this dirty scheme was definitely kept confidential and would also increase monitoring on He Shun. If any signs of violent behavior were detected, he would be forcibly awakened before his brain could issue commands to his hands, and expelled from the holographic space.
 

 
While the variety show encouraged conflict for gimmicks, there were strict personal safety regulations to avoid leaving psychological scars on the actors and guests.
 

 
Anyway, on this morning when Zhong Muxi got up particularly early to make porridge for her friend, He Shun cornered her in the kitchen.
 

 
"Miss Zhong, I want to talk to you."
 

 
He Shun walked up to her.
 

 
Mr. He, who usually paid great attention to his personal image and dressed immaculately, now appeared tired. Underneath his typically resolute and refined face, there was a faint bluish tint, a sign of unkempt stubble. Zhong Muxi flinched slightly: "Is there something wrong? I'm cooking..."
 

 
"Listen to me first."
 

 
He Shun interrupted her, ignoring her fearful body language: "I remember that when you first arrived at the manor, you said you didn’t know how to cook. Why did you lie to me?"
 

 
He knew exactly how to bully people.
 

 
By pointing out the other party’s moral flaws, he made Zhong Muxi, who was prone to self-blame, feel disadvantaged in the conversation.
 

 
"At that time... I didn’t want to cook." Zhong Muxi clenched her fingers tightly.
 

 
"Fine, I won’t hold you accountable for lying," He Shun pretended to be magnanimous, “But isn’t it excessive how you all exclude me from everything? I was clearly deceived and hurt... I heard you’ve been through a breakup too. Why can’t you understand my feelings? By siding with Tong Zhao, you’re an accomplice."
 

 
Caught off guard by the reopened wound, Zhong Muxi looked at him in shock.
 

 
She shook her head, tears welling up in her throat.
 

 
The audience was on the verge of a brain hemorrhage, with some irate ones calling her a pushover, but more were anxiously calling for the show’s director.
 

 
From her reaction, He Shun regained his confidence.
 

 
Although his appearance was plain, this woman did have some merits.
 

 
At least she didn’t ridicule him mercilessly like the other two women.
 

 
He continued his reasoning: "Don’t deny it, and don’t say it’s Tong Zhao who doesn’t welcome me. Half a month has passed, have you ever thought about suggesting to them to invite me along? No, in the face of passive aggression, silence and watching are complicity. I really... didn’t expect you to be this kind of person. Or did you simply not realize it? Men care about details too. My breakup was due to malicious deceit, maybe you’re just too cold and numb."
 

 
Mr. He was particularly resentful.
 

 
Already feeling wronged, he was further ostracized.
 

 
"I didn’t, I didn’t know. Don’t talk to me about this. I don’t want to talk to you…”
 

 
Zhong Muxi usually had strong logical reasoning, but being abandoned was her sore spot. The moment the pain point was touched, her eyes welled up with tears, and she could only shake her head and deny it while trying to hold back the tears. She turned to escape, but he, being perceptive, stopped her in time. This time, he wasn’t angry at all and managed to control himself to avoid any physical contact—Mr. He disliked violence, considering it a barbaric and uncivilized act. The last time was purely a misunderstanding, and Tong Zhao was just too infuriating.
 

 
“Stop avoiding this—”
 

 
Before He Shun could finish his stern speech, he received a kick to his side.
 

 
The kick was swift and fierce, causing his body to tilt sideways and stumble several steps before he managed to steady himself.
 

 
It was technically an act of violence, but the production team deemed it self-defense as long as the kicker didn’t continue to assault him, it wouldn’t cross the line.
 

 
Clearly, Tong Zhao had no interest in continuing to beat him.
 

 
Her strength was limited, and she might even risk injuring herself without making a tough-skinned man feel much pain.
 

 
Tong Zhao was delicate—she could mock and insult, or incite others to fight, but personally taking action? A dog like him didn’t deserve it.
 

 
With a raised chin, Tong Zhao locked eyes with the astonished He Shun. She curled her lips into a smirk, her tone slow and firm, carrying an air of pride and condescension: “Bullying a woman you can’t defeat, so you go after weaker women? Very well, you’ve learned something.”
 

 
“You—”
 

 
“Shut up, did I give you permission to speak?!”
 

 
With the smile gone, Tong Zhao’s expression turned cold. Still dressed in her immaculate white dress, her imposing aura left He Shun speechless.
 

 
“You don’t need to ask her. I just dislike you. You annoy me. You’re not allowed at any gatherings, and if you have any objections, come to me directly. Don’t whine to others…”
 

 
Tong Zhao slowly tilted her chin towards Zhong Muxi, indicating for her to stay behind her.
 

 
She followed Tong Zhao closely like a dog that had found its owner.
 

 
“First, it shows you’re picking on the weak and fearing the strong.”
 

 
“Second, it’s useless to confront them. I’m the one with the decision-making power. Understand? They don’t matter.”
 

 
Deserving of both praise and criticism, Empress Chen never liked using her subordinates as shields.
 

 
However, she didn’t consider this as protection.
 

 
She only believed in evaluating dogs based on their owners.
 

 
He Shun’s action of bypassing her to cause trouble for Zhong Muxi completely crossed her boundaries, making her feel deeply embarrassed. She had to regain her dignity and vent her frustration with a harsh rebuke.
 

 
“And also, you were criticizing the reason for their breakup? According to your logic, the one who dumps can evaluate the one who’s dumped. Fine, listen carefully,”
 

 
Tong Zhao, with Zhong Muxi tightly holding her arm, briefly frowned but tolerated the action as if it were a gift. She channeled her slight irritation onto Mr. He, scrutinizing him from head to toe with her bright apricot eyes, and then shook her head.
 

 
While Zhong Muxi’s head shake made him feel powerful, Tong Zhao’s shake of the head made him feel defeated and humiliated, as if he were being treated like a fool:
 

 
“I rejected your confession because I look down on you, loathe you from head to toe, and find you annoying. If anyone can kneel and perform a kiss-hand gesture for me, you’re not even worthy to lick my shoes while lying on the ground.”
 

 
She was both arrogant and delighted, genuinely happy to demean her enemy.
 

 
He Shun was stunned by the insult.
 

 
The audience was also impressed by Tong Zhao’s spontaneous, flowing arrogance.
 

 
[One person desperately asks Tong Zhao to start a teaching class!!!]
 

 
[Tears, why can’t I insult people as effectively as she does?]
 

 
[Tong Zhao is not just green tea; she’s a fighter jet in the red tea realm, maybe Keemun black tea... People who argue with such confidence are unbeatable. It’s a skill you can’t learn.]
 

 
There were also some off-topic comments.
 

 
Curious passersby wondered how Tong Zhao's fans must be, given how effectively she could curse. Her fans shook their heads and waved their hands, clarifying that it wasn't true. Since her debut, she had always been friendly and had never caused conflicts with others. In fact, there was almost a confrontation with Han Zhi’s fans, but as it turned out, they were all one big family, so it ended up being resolved.
 

 
Tong Zhao had no intention of staying to argue with him.
 

 
Did he deserve it?
 

 
She said everything she wanted to say and felt relieved. She didn't care how others felt; she was a woman who took arrogance to the extreme. Turning off the stove, she led Zhong Muxi out of the kitchen and upstairs. Zhong Muxi hesitated and said, “You mentioned last night that you wanted to have conpoy porridge…”
 

 
[……]
 

 
[……So it was your doing, Tong Zhao!]
 

 
[No wonder she appeared so timely; she was here to supervise, hahaha……]
 

 
“Wait, I’ll let Han Zhi make it. The kitchen is too unlucky right now, and living people shouldn’t enter.” Recently, she had picked up some jargon from playing with Wei Zekai.
 

 
Zhong Muxi whispered, “Is Brother Zhi a ghost?”
 

 
“Hmm, he’s quite ghostly.”
 

 
Han Zhi's reputation suffered.
 

 
He Shun couldn’t stand it any longer and applied to leave the event early.
 

 
After receiving approval from the production team and a vote from VIP viewers, He Shun was removed from the holographic space.
 

 
What awaited him was the sympathetic gaze of the production staff…
 

 
He Shun smiled politely, “Thank you for your hard work. I have a bit of a headache, so I’ll go rest for a while.” He decided to wait until his memory recovered to see the show’s replay and understand why others looked at him strangely.
 

 
And now, back to the reality show.
 

 
Upon arriving on the second floor, Zhong Muxi thanked Tong Zhao, her voice full of tears.
 

 
Tong Zhao wondered, ‘Should I be comforting her right now?’
 

 
‘I can’t do that. I only know how to curse, mock…… and act spoiled……’
 

 
The noble lady was troubled.
 

 
Soon, her tiny bit of conscience and sympathy was depleted by her thinking, and she accepted Zhong Muxi’s thanks with composure, saying, “If you’re grateful, I want tea-marinated chicken wings and squirrel-shaped mandarin fish for dinner.”
 

 
“Okay, I’ll make them all for you.”
 

 
Preparing the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish is quite troublesome in home cooking—it requires deboning the fish, scoring it, and deep-frying it.
 

 
Viewers were excited to witness the birth of the first tool.
 

 
[Comforting people? Tong Zhao doesn’t know how. Just order some food for the cleaning staff.]
 

 
[Learned the art of ordering food as comfort.]
 

 
[I also want to be protected by a little kitty, sob sob sob……]
 

 
Tong Zhao was satisfied.
 

 
After Zhong Muxi calmed down, she couldn’t hold back her tears and quietly cried while holding onto Tong Zhao’s sleeve, making her a bit uncomfortable.
 

 
So, leading the crying and indecisive Zhong Muxi, Tong Zhao knocked on Han Zhi’s door. When he came out in slippers, she pushed her inside and briefly explained the situation: “I’m going to take a nap. I hope to have conpoy porridge by eleven.”
 

 
[It’s time for my favorite segment where Tong Zhao orders food!]
 

 
This comment was highlighted and bolded by other users.
 

 
After saying this, Tong Zhao simply left.
 

 
She believed that Han Zhi wouldn’t do something as low as taking advantage of a vulnerable girl; it was beneath his standards. Even if pressured, he likely wouldn’t act that way. When she woke up right on time at eleven, Zhong Muxi was already at the door with steaming conpoy porridge.
 

 
The viewers on the barrage had reached a level of frustration so high that they lost the will to express it.
 

 
Tong Zhao, how many caretakers' lives have you ruined!
 

 
By evening, everyone received an official notice—player He Shun had decided to withdraw from the game due to personal reasons. His previous selections would be retained, but other players could no longer choose him as their object of affection.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian spat, “Even if he were the only man left in the world, I wouldn’t choose him.”
 

 
“Well said.”
 

 
Tong Zhao happily enjoyed the squirrel-shaped mandarin fish made specially for her.
 

 
Seeing her savoring it, Chang Xiaonian also tried a bit: “It’s so sweet. How did you make it so sweet?”
 

 
Zhong Muxi quickly looked away after glancing at Tong Zhao with embarrassment.
 

 
Tong Zhao loved sweets and preferred a sweeter approach even for hot dishes.
 

 
Chang Xiaonian immediately understood: “...Xiao Xi, you just indulge her!”
 

 
The laughter and chatter around the dinner table temporarily lifted the gloom from her heart.
 

 
However, as night fell and everything grew silent, Zhong Muxi still couldn’t sleep, thinking about what Mr. He had said to her. She couldn’t control herself from recalling that failed relationship; someone she genuinely liked didn’t even give her a proper closure and left her impatiently.
 

 
She didn’t cry or make a fuss during the breakup; letting go wasn’t difficult.
 

 
What was difficult was the endless questioning of why he wasn’t willing to stay.
 

 
Each time, she felt that she was inadequate—otherwise, why couldn’t she keep the person closest to her? Reflecting on every painful detail, she wondered if noticing and doing better at that moment might have salvaged the relationship.
 

 
...
 

 
Unconsciously, Zhong Muxi found herself moving like a zombie, getting out of bed and stepping into the hallway.
 

 
She stood there, crying for a while, overwhelmed by negative emotions again.
 

 
Tonight, there are two people unable to rest peacefully.
 

 
One is Han Zhi.
 

 
The other is Wei Zekai.
 

 
When Han Zhi opened his door and didn’t see anyone in the hallway, he went downstairs. Wei Zekai, moving even more slowly, hesitated repeatedly, thinking about that tearful face, which then turned into the image of a small dog.
 

 
Another person who stays up particularly late and has light sleep is Tong Zhao.
 

 
Tong Zhao wasn’t worried about Zhong Muxi.
 

 
She was here to catch the dog.
 

 
Feeling burdened with the responsibility of being a righteous avenger, Wei Zekai, the dog, encountered Tong Zhao, who was holding a blanket and acting as the dog-catching team leader, once again in the hallway.
 

 
Wei Zekai: [......]
# Chapter48
When two paths cross, the brave win.
 

 
At that moment, Wei Zekai the corgi had many thoughts running through his mind—
 

 
For instance, he imagined a distinctive "danger" character from *Sekiro* appearing above his head.
 

 
For instance, wasn’t this his comrade?
 

 
For instance, why was Tong Zhao coming out at this time?
 

 
His view of Tong Zhao was mixed, combining two perspectives, and was quite complicated.
 

 
Tong Zhao's view of him, however, was much simpler.
 

 
She was determined to catch this dog!
 

 
After removing the bedding, she had only a thin sheet left. She threw the blanket, which fell over the small dog, enveloping him. Catching a dog by hand was too difficult and might give the dog a chance to escape. Tong Zhao never overestimated her physical abilities. Once the blanket covered the little dog, she quickly gathered it up and packed it to bring back to her room.
 

 
[Caught!]
 

 
[Lol, this combination is so offbeat.]
 

 
[The heartbreaker turned dog-catching team leader, Wei Zekai gets the first prize, add a chicken leg!]
 

 
Wei Zekai the dog really wasn’t interested in any damn chicken legs.
 

 
The blanket was making him a bit uncomfortable. Normally, a regular dog would use its claws to get out, but he was afraid of hurting Tong Zhao. So, he kept his claws sheathed and gave some symbolic angry kicks. After a couple of kicks, he found the spot where his paws were stepping felt a bit soft... Damn it!
 

 
Wei Zekai became somewhat guilty and quieted down.
 

 
[It's not like I did it on purpose, why should I feel guilty about it!]
 

 
[Forget it, I’m just afraid of hurting her if I push too hard.]
 

 
[By the way, wasn’t her right hand injured? How come she’s grabbing me so forcefully? Damn it!]
 

 
Wei Zekai’s furious barking was heard clearly by the audience with the God’s-eye view.
 

 
Usually, cursing on a variety show would lead to losing fans.
 

 
But Wei Zekai’s ineffectual, furious barking actually hit the audience’s cute and funny points, making them think the little master was so adorable he should debut directly, more likable than many celebrities' true selves.
 

 
One comment that was highlighted and praised even expressed the audience’s shared sentiment:
 

 
[So, among the six people, only Wei Zekai truly believes Tong Zhao’s hand is still injured? /candle/ candle]
