# Prologue
 

MM… Oh, it’s morning? This is the usual time I get up, so I might as well log in for a bit.

I stretch and check to see if I received any messages while I was asleep. All it takes is a glance at the icon to see if it’s flashing, so it’s easy enough to tell.

After that, I’ll give my inventory a check and replace anything I’m running low on…but that probably won’t be necessary.

I think I’ll go for a stroll through town instead.

 

The real-life time in the world influences the in-game time, although it’s not an exact mirror.

I usually wake up at six in the morning. At that point, it’s dawn in the game too, and by 6:30 a.m., the game transitions to the afternoon. Morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime follow a real-world pattern, while only weather is random.

Hmm. It looks like the rain came to pay a visit today… I guess I’ll abandon my plans for a walk and pass the time until school starts. All I have to do at school today is help out with the cleaning before our end-of-term ceremony, so we’ll be done with that by the afternoon.

Dawn in the game comes again at noon. The weather will change then too, so I’ll have to cross my fingers that I come home to sunny skies.

I finish getting ready and start to head to the front door, when…

“We’ll be out on a date today, so take this and buy whatever you want for lunch!”

“What about tonight?”

“I’ll buy you something,” I tell my sister.

“Okay!”

It sounds like Mom and Dad are spending the day on a date. Akina did have Moreburger for lunch yesterday. But what about today? Sushi?

“Conveyor belt sushi? Or the regular kind?”

“Hmm…we have to clean before lunch today, so let’s do conveyor belt sushi! I want quantity, not quality.”

“Okay. Let’s do that for lunch then.”

“What about yakiniku instead?”

“But it’ll take longer for us to get home.”

“Grrr…”

I know the three pillars of my sister’s life are meat, fish, and time for playing video games. I’m going to shower when I get home anyway, so I don’t really care where we go to eat.

“Well, make up your mind by lunchtime.”

“’Kay.”

She still hasn’t decided by the time we arrive at school, so I give up. I’ll let her make the choice by this afternoon. If that’s still not enough time to think, I’ll decide for her. Why did this have to be such a vicious struggle in the first place?

“Ah! Morning!”

“Morning, Miss Kotone.”

“Good morning.”

My friends from elementary school always act a little “off” around me, so I make a point of ignoring them when they do.

As we chat, my childhood friends Tomohiro and Suguru show up to class, followed by our teacher soon after.

“Okay, people! Time to take attendance!”

Naturally, this is a big school. We have people who normally do the cleaning around campus too, so once our teacher divides us up and assigns us sections to clean, we chat amongst ourselves and finish up in no time at all.

I head back to the classroom. The other students gradually return once they’ve finished cleaning their own sections.

 

After some time, Tomohiro arrives, and he looks like he’s in a good mood for some reason.

“Hey, Kotone.”

“Hm?”

“Let’s go on a date sometime.”

Everyone else in the classroom turns to look at us, but I just ignore them. It’s only a “date” because we’re a boy and a girl, I’m sure.

“Where to?”

“The beach!”

“I don’t know about that…”

“Ah, I mean in-game. Imbamunte in the south.”

“Hm? Ah, I see. A safe zone?”

“It’s super realistic there, and it’s beautiful too. It doesn’t cost any money, we don’t need our parents’ permission, and you don’t have to worry about getting sunburned. We can just sit there and relax.”

It’s true that a beach trip is kind of a big deal for students. But that’s not so much the case when the trip is in a video game.

“I’ll have to get a bathing suit.”

“I already have the materials. I was going to ask for Mr. Dentelle to make one. What kind do you want?”

“Hm… How about a bikini with a pareo?”

“The thing you wrap around your hips? What color?”

“Anything’s fine.”

“I guess Mr. Dentelle can take care of the color and design. I’m sure he’ll be thrilled either way, and since it’s a game, he won’t need your measurements!”

If he’s going to make me a bathing suit, I might as well just accept it. As for food, I’ll be sure to prepare sandwiches or something of the sort.

“Oh, one other thing. Aside from our date, what say we have a barbecue too? We can invite the people in our parties along with our other friends.”

“Hmm…I can prepare food, but I don’t have the materials to make the sauces we’ll need.”

The charcoal cooker from my cooking kit would be a bit too small for a barbecue. I don’t have anything like an iron plate to cook on, either… But most importantly, I have no barbecue sauce. It will probably taste plenty delicious with salt and pepper alone, but it’s just not the same.

“Hm… Kotone, isn’t it possible that because of your skills, you’re the only one who can cook meat?”

“Ah… That seems likely to me.”

“It’s not gonna work, then. Making one person do all the grilling is no fun.”

Having a barbecue with friends means everyone pitching in to grill the meat. That way, it becomes a fun group activity.

 

Our teacher returns.

“Great job, everyone! Since you worked so hard to clean up, I have a present for you all.”

“Free juice!”

“Ha ha!” Our teacher pauses for a moment. “No, it’s your homework.”

“Awwww!”

“I told you yesterday that this was coming!”

He certainly did.

“It’s a simple assignment to make sure you don’t forget anything. It’s not much, so get it over with quickly. All right. Dismissed! Don’t be late tomorrow!”

It’s still a bit before lunch. Did that sister of mine pick what she wants to eat yet?

What’s this? Oh, my phone’s ringing. It’s Eli.

Elizabeth…the daughter of the person Mom works for. She’s the real deal—the rich young daughter of a CEO. We’re also the same age and have been friends since we were little. I guess I should answer the call. She’ll want to speak English, but everyone knows I’m fluent in the language.

“Good day, Stasia.”

“Good day, Eli. What’s new?”

“Where are you right now?”

“At school. I’m about to eat lunch and then head home.”

“Go straight home. I’ll be there at noon.”

I gather my thoughts for a moment. “You’re here, aren’t you?”

“I have Abby with me too.”

“Abby” is short for Abigail, the daughter of the CEO my dad works for and my sister’s childhood friend, since, like Akina, she’s one year younger than me.

“So that’s why Dad had a bad feeling about something.”

“I’ll bet he did! What were you planning to eat, by the way?”

“My sister’s been trying to choose between sushi and yakiniku all morning.”

“Let’s make it sushi, then. I want some too. How about meat for dinner? Barbecue, right?”

“Ah, you haven’t talked to my parents, have you?”

“Of course not!”

“I didn’t think so. They’re out on some sort of date right now, so I’ll have to tell them not to bring us back dinner.”

“Oh, they’re not home? Hear that, Father? They’re not home, so you can’t give them a scare.”

So they really were planning on scaring my parents. But it’s just about time for lunch, and I’m starting to doubt if I’ll have time for a shower. I need to get home fast.

We’re probably going to need our lunch to be delivered instead.

“Let’s head home, Tomohiro,” I call out.

“Sure. Suguru! Let’s go!”

“Fine.”

We head for the gates and meet up with my sister and her friends.

“Big Sis! Let’s go get some meat!”

“I’m so sorry, but we’re going to have to wait until dinner for meat.”

“Huh?! Why?!”

“Eli and Abby are coming over, so we have to head straight home. It’s a surprise attack.”

“An ambush from an army of rich girls?! So are the CEOs coming too?”

If the daughters will be there, so will the parents.

“Our lunch choices have been reduced, but the quality will be much higher.”

“All right, I forgive you! Let’s get going!”

It’s the same members in our group as yesterday—Tomohiro and Suguru, as well as Akina’s friends, Yanase and Matsukane. We all head to my house, when two very conspicuous cars pass by us. Oh, wait, they’re stopping just up ahead. A woman wearing a distinctive outfit steps out of the first car.

Yanase and Matsukane both gasp. “A maid?!”

“Oh, you two have never seen one, huh?” comments Tomohiro.

That made me realize Yanase and Matsukane never happened to be around when the girls showed up for a visit.

“It’s been a while, hasn’t it, all of you?” One of the maids approaches us. “Although, I haven’t met you two before…have I? Please call me Colette.”

“I’m Yanase.”

“And I’m Matsukane.”

“Would you like to join us in the cars?”

“Huh?!”

I head toward the car, since we won’t all be able to walk together on the sidewalk.

All of us could fit between the two cars, but having Yanase and Matsukane take a car alone feels a little mean. Since Abby will be riding in the second car, my sister will choose that one.

“I can go with you two in Abby’s car!” Akina offers.

“That sounds good. Tomohiro and Suguru can join me in the front car,” I reply.

Those two have met our visitors several times already, so there shouldn’t be any issues. We get straight inside the air-conditioned car and take off driving.

The occupants of the car include a kind-looking old man; Elizabeth, AKA Eli, in a light and simple dress; the driver; and Colette, who stepped out of the car to talk to us earlier. Everyone inside is American, and they know me through Mom’s work. The car behind us is full of British people who know Dad.

“Look at you! You’re always so pretty!” says Eli’s father.

“Thanks, I appreciate it. I’m glad to see you look well.”

“I am! Although Japan’s always so very hot at this time of year…”

I certainly agree with that. It’s truly scorching here.

As we catch up, we arrive home in no time at all thanks to a quick car ride. I open the gates so that they can use our driveway, hand over my house key to Tomohiro, and walk over to my sister.

“Eli told me she’ll have lunch with us, and she’ll pay too.”

“Then why don’t you two join us?”

“Huh?!”

Akina drags Yanase and Matsukane into the house while I follow behind them. They both look rather stiff. That surely must be due to the overwhelming power of the limousine—a vehicle that anyone can tell is expensive at a single glance.

I wonder if those two will even be able to taste the delicious food we’re about to eat? They just seem so nervous.

Since it sounds like everyone is spending the day here at our house, I’ll order the food for delivery and then go take a shower. I’m sure they’ll have no trouble making themselves at home. I don’t need to show them where the parlor is… After all, they found my living room without any issues.

 

With my refreshing shower over, I head back to the living room.

Eli and Abby are both beautiful, but Eli has a “calm and cool” personality while Abby is perky and cute. Maybe it’s simpler to call them the tsundere rich girl and the little bunny rich girl. Not that Eli is actually tsundere, but you get what I’m going for. Or maybe thinking of them as a villainess and heroine works better…

By the way, Eli’s about one centimeter taller than me, while Abby is ten centimeters shorter.

“I haven’t seen you in so long, Abby.”

“It’s good to see you again, Tasha! I’m still just so jealous of your boobs!”

Most of the younger girls in my life love to hug me, my little sister included.

I see two large bags sitting in a corner of the room. What could those be? Eli spots what I’m staring at, stands up straight in an intimidating stance, and declares in a loud voice, “Tasha, you have a fun game you play, right? It took so long for Father to get his hands on it!”

It’s like our two hearts just became one.

My sister scoots over to the bags and peeks inside. “Whoa, it’s FLFO. You’re gonna play?”

“I’ll be playing as a rich young girl with blonde hair drills.”

“But isn’t that what you actually are?”

“I could never get my hair that coiled in real life! By the way, we’ll both be playing.”

“What? You’re going to have blonde hair spirals too, Abby?”

“Yes!”

“Ah, I see… But you have four consoles here?” my sister points out.

When I hear those words, I turn to look at the two CEOs.

“Sadly, it won’t be us joining you… It’s really too bad!”

“It’s awful!”

They looked truly depressed. But that could only mean… I turn to look at the maids.

“Yes, the two of us will be joining them.”

“We look forward to playing.”

The girls were bringing their maids with them. Their names are Colette, AKA Letty, and Dorothy, AKA Dory. They choose to wear maid uniforms because they like them. The black-and-white long dresses are a proper uniform for that line of work, after all, so they say they’re handy to wear.

Our height order starts with Letty, then goes to Eli, me, Dory, Rina, and Abby. Eli wears her wavy hair down just past her shoulders, Letty and Abby have shoulder-length hair, and Dory has hers up in a ponytail.

I remember the time I asked them if their maid outfits were too hot in the Japanese summer, but they just whipped out some ice packs wrapped in towels. The outfits allow them to hide things too, which, according to them, is a key benefit. They were quite insistent.

A real-life rich girl with blonde hair drills and a professional maid…or would she be called a lady-in-waiting? Regardless, there’s even two of this exact pair… How intense.

“Will we be able to obtain maid outfits in the game?”

“This is the only outfit we feel comfortable in.”

Is this the mark of a pro? Or an occupational sickness?

“Well…I’m sure you can find some…but we can at least have them made.”

“Dentelle would be happy to make them, I’m certain. The only problem is that since he’s the best, it’ll cost you a lot.”

Tomohiro is right. Mr. Dentelle will almost certainly make maid uniforms for them. He’s the very best of the best. Since maid uniforms are so famous, I’ll bet he’s already stitched up one or two. I can’t imagine there are many other people who go out of their way to seek them out as their outfit of choice.

The problem is probably going to be their own pickiness. In the end, they’ll almost certainly order their own personal uniforms.

“What about fancy dresses?”

“He’ll definitely be happy to make them, but I haven’t found any silk yet.”

“No silk? What about your outfit?”

“I was wondering about that too. Is it made of some kind of special in-game material?” Dad’s company CEO joins the conversation. He’s a designer, after all.

“That’s right. Judging by the description, it’s some kind of fantasy metal. It has that metallic luster.”

“I see…”

But wait. Why do they know about that?

“I saw the video, of course. I figured that was you, so I looked through it carefully.”

“I saw the commercial and the trailer too!” says Abby.

Ah, I get it now. They figured out who I am. That made them want to give the game a try, so they came to bother Dad, and now we’re here. What were they thinking?

RIIING!

Oh, that’s the doorbell. The food’s finally here. I check outside and confirm the delivery.

Everyone swarms the food and carries it inside. I snap a picture of the group gathered around the table to send to Dad.

After a while, I hear a ringing from the connect board belonging to Mr. Louis, Dad’s CEO. It’s safe to assume that’s Dad.

Mr. Louis checks the name of the caller and chuckles as he answers. As for me, I respond to a message from Mom and bring up the topic of dinner.

By the way, my family behaves the same way when we go to visit them, so it’s really all fair in the end.

 

After finishing the delicious—and expensive—sushi delivery, I see our four friends off. They seemed to have calmed down enough to experience the taste properly, so I’m glad I didn’t reveal our guests’ true identities. But Akina will probably spoil it later. Tomohiro and Suguru already know who they are, so there’s no need to worry about them.

As we chat, Akina races off to her room, letting me know she’s going to stream. I stay behind in the living room to watch her stream on the TV.

The livestreams translate different languages automatically, but that’s not necessary if you understand the language in the first place. Sometimes it mistranslates things too. It looks like she’s turned off the automatic translation when it comes to English.

To Eli and the others, Japanese has a lot of words in it and the automatic translation seems fishy to them, so they really appreciate this. They also think it could bring in more viewers from the English-speaking world.

They’re lounging around peacefully and watching the stream, which means it’s all right for me to go play the game for myself. I log in too.

I’m going to go visit the old woman at the general store.


# Chapter 1: Thursday
 

I LOG IN, stretch, and head to the general store. The woman told me to come back when I’d raised my Alchemy skill to its second tier, and so here I am.

“Hello. I’m back today as an alchemist.”

“Is that right? Then let me share this old soul’s wisdom with you. Have a seat.”

I sit down in the chair next to her, though I don’t know why it’s there in the first place.

“Let me first make sure you’re ready to learn, because I’ll start treating you like my pupil. You won’t be able to learn from most other alchemists after this. Are you sure this old granny’s the one for you?”

“I don’t know any other alchemists, and the wisdom from a pioneer—or rather, from an older person—will be very valuable. I don’t see a problem in choosing you.”

“Good. Then let’s start with the basics.”

Granny teaches me all the things I can do as an alchemist. “You can use cores you get from monsters, create items, disassemble them, and control which attributes you get when you make a new substance. That’s what it means to be an alchemist. What level are you now?”

“Right now, I’m…two.”

Wait, how did it get there? Did my Dark Rituals count toward my Alchemy level?

“Hmm… Ah, I see. Do you know Darkness Magic?”

“I do.”

“What about Necromantic Magic?”

“I learned that too. Is there a problem?”

“Is that right? No, that’ll do. Now that you’re an alchemist, learn Golem Training whenever you can.”

“Golems? That sounds interesting.”

“To put it simply, it’s a worse version of Necromantic Magic.”

“Oh…”

“Be sure to protect the secrets I’m about to share. If you don’t, I won’t recognize you as my pupil any longer.”

“I understand.”

“I’m going to tell you about Golem Training, Necromantic Magic, and how they relate to Chimera Creation.”

Oh? Chimera Creation? This sounds interesting too. The word “chimera” makes it easy for me to imagine what this is going to be like.

Golem Training involves modified monster cores to create the core for a golem. These golems will only listen to the simplest of orders. They can fight in an unsophisticated manner, but any coordination from them will be difficult. If anything, they’re great for straightforward tasks like carrying heavy objects, but alchemists throughout history have seen that behavior and researched whether it’s practical to use the creatures for combat.

The problem with Golem Training is that golems aren’t very smart. It’s their only flaw, but it’s also a fatal one. As long as they have mana, they can absorb materials around them so as to continue to function when their bodies break down. They’re perfectly safe as long as their cores remain intact.

The best way to start would have been to upgrade Golem Training. I also could have used taming if I simply wanted to control monsters, but that has nothing to do with the Alchemy skill. That was how the taboo act of Chimera Creation came to be.

“You used Alchemy to control their bodies, right?”

“Exactly. But it didn’t work out that well in the end, even if I did expect it.”

Living beings who have their bodies manipulated won’t listen to orders. Most alchemists end up killed by their chimeras. With the sudden changes to their bodies, it probably causes them pain when they’re recreated over and over again.

The biggest problem is that once the alchemist is killed, the crazed chimera remains. After all, unlike golems, they were once living creatures.

These poor chimeras resort to violence and begin destroying everything in their paths—be it other monsters, trees, or anything else. Anyone who remains oversees cleaning up after them. Depending on what it was made from, the chimera’s damage capabilities range from minimal to all kinds of extremes. They cause so much chaos that instead of being defeated by normal adventurers, it’s far more common for them to meet their end at the hand of knights sent out by the government.

“But the next problem was the creation of undead. It’s said that Stellura, the goddess of reincarnation, has full jurisdiction over the souls of the living. And that those of us here on the earth must never interfere. This was such a problem that the alchemists all came together, investigated, and quickly ruled that Chimera Creation was immoral.”

To put it more accurately, it’s not that they thought Chimera Creation was wrong in and of itself. It’s the combination of souls, creating an undead, that’s immoral.

“There’s two ways to go about Chimera Creation. You can combine a living being with multiple fresh corpses or you combine a living being with multiple living sacrifices.”

“I see. The latter isn’t accepted because it involves a fusing of souls.”

“That’s right. They don’t know how to function when the soul is fused to a different body. So in that case, all you have to do is fuse parts from the same kind of body…or so they say. People are always coming up with ridiculous ideas like that.”

Humans never know when to give up. After this, they turned their attention to the Summoning Spell, curious to learn the principles behind it. This eventually resulted in the discovery of Necromantic Magic.

However, engaging in true necromancy would make this another act of meddling with the undead. That wasn’t something anyone was interested in. Despite it being called Necromantic Magic, it’s more like the head of Summoning Spell fused with the body of Alchemy. Summoning Spell creates a growing brain, while Golem Training from Alchemy creates a physical body.

At that point, the rest came down to trial and error. That was when they found that using the powers of Darkness Magic was the most efficient way to utilize a monster’s flesh and bones as a catalyst.

“That’s why we combine these forms of magic to create a golem powered by something completely unlike the soul of a living being. Its brain doesn’t devolve even if it’s defeated, and you don’t have to worry about it being injured. Well…there’s still the problem of having to compensate it with flesh and blood, and considering the materials, it will never be anything other than undead in the end. That’s where the name Necromantic Magic comes from too.”

In other words, alchemists went off fundamentals and AI to use Summoning Spell, then added in Darkness Magic and Alchemy to use a monster’s flesh and blood, and finished off with the art of Golem Training to produce a body that could serve as a vessel.

Darkness Magic and Alchemy are combined for this act, which means Dark Ritual probably raises both skills at the same time.

“These days, Chimera Creation is still taboo, especially now that we have Necromantic Magic. Although that’s certainly not a bad thing.”

Now I understand the backstory here. I decide to ignore the question that was raised of whether skills were truly things brought about by gods. To be honest, I don’t really care. I think I’m going to ignore that mystery entirely.

Still, it doesn’t seem like there’s any value in attempting Chimera Creation. After all, you end up fighting the chimera you created yourself, and I’d be making an enemy of a fellow undead at the same time. If you beat the chimera, you must face an undead. If you lose, then the knights are deployed to exterminate it, right? Then the government will be after me too. And Granny will drop me as a pupil. I’d probably be making an enemy of every alchemist in the land as well. There’s just no upside.

I’m definitely fine just sticking with the Secret Art of Necromancy.

“Very well. It doesn’t sound like it has any merits, so I won’t be resorting to Chimera Creation.”

“But it’s a quick way to get a very strong servant.”

“Can you really call it a servant if it doesn’t obey you?”

“Hmm. Good point.”

“I’m an undead too, after all. I can’t be making my comrades into my enemies.”

She paused for a moment. “What’s that? Oh, that’s right, you’re an outsider. Hmm…”

“Ah, that reminds me…do you know of an entrance to the Nether?”

“Well, I’d like to say I don’t, but…”

“So, you do know?”

I only asked her on a whim, since it seemed like an old lady might know that sort of thing. But despite being the one to ask the abrupt question, I’m the one left feeling startled. It’s not every day that you meet someone who knows about an entrance to the Nether, you know?

“I don’t know for sure, but there’s a place I have my suspicions about. There’s a woman who works at the town church. She probably knows more than I do about it.”

“A church…?”

“You look like you’re at a pretty high level, huh?”

“Yes, I’m a High Undead. You can tell just by looking at me?”

“Undead who barely look different from the living are usually high-level zombies of some sort. I’d be more surprised if you weren’t at a high level. You have Purification Resistance, right?”

“I do.”

“That’ll be a big help, even at its low tier. Mid-tier will be enough for you to safely enter churches. Go pay them a visit, and feel free to say that Meghan ordered you to speak with Luciana.”

“Ms. Luciana, is it? I guess I’ll head over there after this…”

“Ah, that’s right, since you’re undead, I have something that will probably help you… Wait a second, I’ll go get it.”

This was the first time I’d ever heard her name: Granny Meghan. She strolls away briskly, unlike the slow shuffle I expected, and returns a minute later carrying a book.

“Let’s see… Here we are. Memorize this passage.”

“Oh…I was wondering how I was going to do this. I really appreciate it.”

 

You have learned basic Alchemy recipe: Parts

 

The Parts recipe is a way of repairing bodily damage. It looks like it’s the combination of core stones with living flesh (mid-level or higher). There’s a note written down as well… Quality reduces the penalty time that comes with a repair. A+ and higher quality lowers the vulnerability of the part after death? I’m so glad I know this now.

“Thank you very much.”

“I’m just getting started. Read all these too.”

My log fills up with a bunch of recipes again.

“These are the absolute basics. In other words, anyone on this path must know these recipes. If something doesn’t make any sense to you, come see me. I may or may not teach you more, depending on what you’re asking for. It’s important not to forget how to research things yourself, or your future will end up bleak.”

“I understand what you mean, but don’t you think that’s pretty harsh?”

“I don’t take a pupil in the first place if I don’t think they can keep up.”

“I see. What else should I know about, aside from Chimera Creation?”

“Let’s see… Have you used Alchemy Circle, the one you get at level 30?”

“No, not yet.”

“You start by looking at the cloth and tracing the circle with mana. But that’s only the beginning. You’ll be able to start using things you can’t place on the cloth.”

“Could that be the same as Chimera Creation?”

“Alchemy Circle is one way to do special circles like that. But don’t try anything crazy that you don’t know about yet. Remember that Alchemy is a convenient skill, but it comes with dangers too.”

“I understand.”

I decide to ask her for advice about Necromantic Magic while I’m at it.

“Necromantic Magic starts you out with a baby, basically. The creation will be slow-witted before it begins to learn. How it grows up depends on how you raise it. You can use it as a meat shield, sure, but what’s important is to not forget your feelings of love for it. Try praising the creation after a battle and be sure to remember what the skill has in common with Summoning Spell.”

“Got it. Thank you so much.”

“All right. Get going.”

She taught me all those recipes and the origins of skills like Necromantic Magic, so I feel like I got a lot out of this visit. I exit Granny Meghan’s shop.

 

Special requirements fulfilled. You’ve unlocked “Title: Alchemist’s Pupil.”

 

ALCHEMIST’S PUPIL

Become a student of Meghan from Starting Town.

 

That was simple enough.

I guess I should head to the church now. It’s somewhere northwest of the plaza in Starting Town. I’ve avoided it until now, but I’m beginning to sense the same thing I felt in Imbamunte. I ignore it and enter inside.

The church looks like…a normal place of worship. It’s a room with four statues and long pews. There appears to be another player here, praying in front of the statues. But suddenly, light envelopes them.

I’ve seen that light before… It wasn’t me, but Mr. Alf and Mr. Skelly who experienced it.

A woman with a pair of white wings emerges from the light.

“Yes!! I get to be an angel now!”

“Congratulations.”

“Wha?! Ah…Princess?”

“Good day. It looks like I just so happened to arrive at the moment of your evolution. The two of us are enemies, aren’t we?”

“No way, no way, no…way? Um…I guess I’ll upgrade my light magic.”

“So we are enemies.”

“Four times damage multiplier against dark attribute…”

“It sounds like we’re an even match.”

She pauses for a moment before responding, “Ah, I’m Cupid.”

“My name is Anastasia. Please feel free to call me whatever you like.”

“Certainly, Princess.”

I knew she’d say that…

We part ways so that the angel can go report this information on the forums. I have a feeling we’ll be seeing even more angels in the future.

I ask a nearby church worker if Ms. Luciana is around.

“Is there a person here named Ms. Luciana? Ms. Meghan asked me to meet with her.”

“Lady Luciana, you say? Please wait just a moment.”

The title of “Lady” must mean she’s important, right? But I still get to meet with her like normal… Well, it’s also possible that mentioning Ms. Meghan’s name has some sort of weight to it.

After I wait for a while, an old woman returns alongside the church worker. The old woman’s disciple robes are quite fancy and eye-catching.

“Oh my, what a pretty young visitor we have.”

“My name is Anastasia.”

“I thought so. Women who wear gray dresses are famous for being mild-mannered.”

“I’ve never heard that before.”

“That’s what they say in this town. So, what’s this about Meghan?”

“I’m an undead, you see, and I’m looking for an entrance to the Nether.”

“I see. So that’s why you came to pay me a visit?”

After a moment of thought, she points at a nearby chair, and I take a seat.

“I don’t actually know of it myself, but I’m at least aware of a place where you might be able to find it. I just don’t know for sure what state it’s in right now. After all, only Undead can see the entrance to the Nether.”

“This is the only lead I have right now, so a potential location alone is plenty.”

“Hmm…I see… All right. I’ll tell you where it is if you’ll do me a favor.”

“A…favor? I don’t mind, as long as it’s something I can do.”

“Can you use Laundry yet?”

“Yes, I can.”

“Then it’s absolutely something you’re capable of. What I need your help with is cleaning.”

“Cleaning?”

“Exactly. The place where I think the entrance can be found is to the northeast of this town, past the currently unused catacombs. I want you to clean up Stellura’s former temple—her place of worship.”

“There used to be a temple past the catacombs?”

“It’s been abandoned for a very long time. I’m sure it’s all run down by now…but it’s likely that the area around the statue, the church itself, is still intact. Clean it as well as you’re able to while you’re searching for the entrance, and that will be fine.”

 

Quest added: “Clean the Abandoned Temple” is now available.

 

CLEAN THE ABANDONED TEMPLE

Travel to Stellura’s former temple to the northeast of Starting Town and tidy up her place of worship.

Quest giver: Luciana

Reward: ???

 

Since I accepted the request in exchange for information, I imagine Ms. Luciana won’t have any other reward for me…which must mean the game will provide me with something else. It sounds like there might be some kind of secret to discover.

“I don’t particularly care how long it takes, so just be safe out there. It’s been a long time since the area was inhabited. These days, you might not even be able to navigate through it.”

“Have you heard any reports of monsters in the area?”

“I’m guessing there will be the undead types out there, but I’m not sure. Try asking Belstead’s adventurers’ union about it.”

She explains that a single statue of Stellura can be swarmed by the undead, which is why the old temple ended up abandoned. The current church now has statues of Stellura at all four pillars to prevent such an outcome. It’s one of those little bits of trivia you find throughout the game.

“But isn’t there a single statue of Stellura in the town square?”

“That one’s a little special because of how it was built and what materials it was made with. It’s a representation of the faces of space, time, and fate, but it also serves as a barrier for our very town. The statue in the town square has a different presence and color than the ones here in the church.”

“I see. So they’re not all ‘statues’ in the same sense of the word?”

The statue in the town square and the ones in the church really are different colors.

Ms. Luciana tells me she has to return to work, so I thank her and exit the church. I guess I’ll head back to the town square. The church is still working to purify me while I’m within its walls.

Catacombs to the northeast of Starting Town…that must be my home. The temple is supposed to be even farther past that, which probably means it’s in the forest to the north of Belstead, right? If that’s the case, it probably would be safe to get information from their adventurers’ union.

 

All righty. It looks like I’ve finished up everything I want to do. What next? Mr. Skelly isn’t around at this time of day, so I’ll have to tell him about things later.

Hmm…since I don’t have anything else to do, why not head to Belstead? There’s no time limit on the quest, but I’m still curious about that secret reward. I think I’ll go for it.

I watch a few members of the demon race heading for the church as I teleport to Belstead from the statue of Stellura. Then I head to the adventurers’ union.

“Welcome. How can I help you today?”

“Do you have any information about what lies past the forest to the north?”

“I really don’t recommend visiting that area…but I do have information.”

“It’s important to me. Could you tell me about the enemies there? A person from the church told me there would be undead…”

“You’ll find undead there, certainly. These are mid-tier classes of undead. They won’t be very intelligent, of course, since they’re not immortals, but as wild creatures, their instincts will be intense.”

“What does that mean, exactly?”

“Packs of armored skeleton wolves and the like will attack you together.”

The instincts of “wild creatures”? As an undead, that’s a bit insulting. But sure, let’s go with that.

Setting that aside, armored skeleton wolves? I’ve never heard of them before. They’ll be in packs too? That must mean they’re linked together. Hmm…Light Burst will hurt me as well, so dealing with them will be tricky.

For now, I take the information on the enemies.

 

ARMORED SKELETON

These skeletons are dressed in chain mail, making them more resistant to blunt force attacks.

Armored skeletons may wield either swords or bows and arrows.

 

ARMORED SKELETON WOLF

An armored skeleton in wolf form. Be wary of sudden Shadow Magic attacks.

 

REVENANT

A type of zombie without Decomposing Body. A tough foe with normal movement capabilities.

 

FOREST WOLF ZOMBIE

A northern forest wolf in zombie form. Forest wolf zombies also lack Decomposing Body.

 

FLYING SKULL

A skull that flies through the air, attacking those below with Dark Magic.

 

PHANTOM KNIGHT

A living armor foe who is extremely resistant to damage.

 

“Do you already have Identify?”

“I do.”

“Then be very cautious if you spot a leader or general. They’ll have command skills, which makes them much harder to defeat than normal.”

“Is there a chance I’ll run into them?”

“Definitely. If you plan to go there, you’ll need light magic, but learning Holy Magic would be even better.”

Holy Magic, you say? I could easily get hit by that too… I can probably ignore revenants, since we’re the same race. But if they link up with the others and attack me anyway, I might just crumple into a ball and cry. The wolf zombies sound intriguing. They’re fellow zombies, but will I really be able to ignore them as well?

I thank the receptionist woman and start toward the door, but I decide to retrieve some equipment before I go. I choose the iron equipment I earned when we defended Starting Town: a sword, spear, axe, dagger, greatsword, helmet, armor, gloves, and boots. I can use these for my Secret Art of Necromancy, so they won’t take up inventory space. I’ll take some monster cores along too.

I won’t know how strong the enemies are until I go there and see for myself, so I may as well start heading that way. I have over 40,000 gold on hand. I suppose I’ll buy some more veggies and pork intestines as well. That leaves me with a bit over 10,000 gold left.

Since I have 39 capacity now, I could do a summoning if I wanted to…but suddenly starting off in the second area like this seems like it will be tough for them. It’s still worth a try though. As for weapons…I’ll give them an axe and no armor for now.

In order to summon something, you must pick a spot and include key phrases of a summoning command and what kind of thing you’re calling for. But does it matter what order you say them in? Hmm…since it’s essentially calling for a servant to obey you, it’s probably best to use the imperative form?

As for the site of the summoning…that seems a little harder. I take out my rapier and point it at the ground in front of me. This makes it official, right? It seems like it takes a bit of practice to set the site of a summoning ritual.

“Come forth to me, skeleton!”

The Dark Ritual summoning circle…or maybe it’s an alchemy circle, since it uses Alchemy? Well, whatever. A black circle appears on the ground where I point my rapier, and I watch as a skeleton emerges. I see that it has an iron axe on its back and everything. From the outside, it looks like a normal skeleton—just a bunch of bones. I couldn’t really say it looks like something that can fight in the second area.

Should I arm it with iron equipment instead? Hmm…what about using a monster core or something? I take out the goblin core to show it, but I get what feels like a “no thank you.” The two of us can understand each other, it seems.

“Is that axe the only weapon you need?”

CLACK

Its neck made a little rattling noise as it cocked its head. Is it just me, or is this skeleton actually pretty cute? Wait, no, it’s still only level 1. I must question the skeleton in ways that are simple enough for its slow mind.

“Do you want a sword?”

CLICK

That was a nod. I also felt like it was saying “yes,” so that must mean it wants a sword, right? Well, maybe it’s too soon to know for sure.

“Do you want a spear?”

CLICK

“Do you want an axe?”

CLICK

Actually… “You’re fine with using any weapon?”

CLICK

Yep. Um… “You’ll learn to use whatever you’re given, so anything’s fine?”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

It’s very honest. What a proper servant.

It looks like my skeleton is very capable of responding. By the way, all I’m hearing is the rattling of its head when it moves. I can only kind of discern things through the secondary voice.

But I haven’t asked the important questions yet. It feels strange to ask the skeleton directly, but I’ll see what I can get out of it.

“Do you need a name?”

CLACK CLACK

That’s…a no.

“If I summon more of you, would you share a soul?”

CLICK CLACK CLACK CLACK

So it’s like a soul shared on the cloud? I see. That explains why it has to learn new items you give it from square one.

“You need time to get accustomed to things when you’re in a new body?”

CLICK

Of course, of course. It’ll take time for it to gain experience with any new weapon I give it now. But that also applies to its physical body. If I customize it, I think it will need to learn how to handle its weaknesses.

I thought for a moment about my next question. “Do you need monster cores?”

CLICK

“You do? So you won’t last in this state?”

CLICK

In that case, I should use Core Processing with my Alchemy skill. My goblin cores turn into monster cores (extra small). Then my elite goblin cores become monster cores (small), my troll cores become monster cores (medium), and my goblin general core becomes monster core (large). Now I have eighteen stones in total.

“Here, you can use these.”

CLICK

“All right…let’s give you a medium core.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

I hand a monster core (medium) to the skeleton, and as soon as it sticks the stone in its mouth, the stone dissolves and disappears.

 

Servant’s level has increased.

 

Servant’s level…I think I get it. That seems to be a way of expressing the strength of my servants. Well, considering it’s at base level, this must mean the AI level went up. So that rises when you feed it monster cores? The skeleton went up four levels and is now at level 5.

If monster cores work, then what about orbs?

“How about this? Can you use these?”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

That was an intense rattle. “Here, take it.”

 

Servant’s level has increased.

 

Whaaat? Something’s not right here! My skeleton passed level 30?! Um, I need to call a GM… No, I’ll just send a normal message to Support.

I write up a question, asking if they can please confirm the amount of EXP my Secret Art of Necromancy servant just gained when I gave it an orb and if it was a bug or not.

I take my skeleton and its newfound power for a test of battle skills with a pigg.

“All right, show me what you’ve got!”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

It jumps up and strikes the pigg with a one-handed axe. I feel like I should also give it a shield, but the pigg’s actual attacks are easy to dodge. The skeleton’s having no problems. I’m sure its stats must not be that high due to its low skill level, but its AI level sure shot up. I’m not sure if that’s a bug or what, exactly. Maybe it was an increase in processing ability? Well, I don’t have anything to compare it to before the skeleton leveled up, so who knows.

“Oiiink!”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

Watching a cute cartoonish piggy engaged in battle with a skeleton feels surreal.

As I watch from the side, I see a message arrive from management.

So it really was a bug! I knew that was too many levels all at once. Let’s see…they say they’ll message me when they’re ready, so I need to log out, wait for their next message, and log in again.

The skeleton managed to defeat the pigg without any trouble, so I end the summoning, dismantle the pigg without absorbing it, and log out once I reach the town.

I do my stretches in the real world and log back in when I see another message has arrived.

The message informs me that my orbs will be refunded, and my servant’s level is being rolled back.

“Hi there, Anastasia. I’m GM Kuon.”

Oh, a GM showed up.

“We apologize for the bug you encountered and appreciate the report you sent in. In return, please select one gift from the following list.”

I have the choice of either 50,000 gold, a set of combat consumables (potions, etc.), a set of production consumables (materials, etc.), a one-hour skill EXP boost ticket (must be used within one day), and 3 SP.

The combat consumables set may as well be garbage for me…

“May I ask what the material set contains and how I retrieve it?”

“If you choose the production set, you’ll be able to pick which skill you want to use your items for. However, the items you’re given depend on your own skill levels. They’re not available to trade, of course.”

I see. So I can’t have someone with higher skill levels than me activate the gift and give me the contents. The admin explains that the combat set provides a different rank depending on my base level.

I have to be careful, since the EXP ticket disappears after a day if I don’t use it. It doesn’t say how much it will rise, but the increase depends on the skill. Maybe it would work well for first-tier skills? But at the same time, leveling those quickly isn’t too impressive.

“I’ll take the 3 SP, please,” I finally answered.

“The SP… You’re sure? You won’t be able to change your choice later.”

“I’m sure.”

“Very well. I’ll transfer you 3 SP.”

“Thank you.”

“Of course. Could you please confirm that you’ve received it?”

I check and see that I have three more SP than before. I got my orbs back too, and my servant’s level is now at 7 instead of 5. What’s with that?

“Is my servant supposed to be at level 7?”

“It looks like the EXP from the pigg battle is contributing to that.”

“Oh, I see. I only gave that a try because I thought you’d reset the level anyway.”

“Feel free to think of it as a small bonus. Do you need anything else from me today?”

“No, I’m all right.”

“Understood. I hope you continue to enjoy your FLFO experience.”

Kuon disappears into the air after that.

I summon my skeleton again. For some reason, Unit One is more slumped over than before. Is it because his levels were rolled back? There was nothing either of us could do about that. I give him one orb, three monster cores (medium), and five monster cores (small).

My servant gobbles them down and grows to level 23. Now he’s an adequate fighter for this area…or so I’d like to think, but the only thing that’s really grown is his AI level. I need Unit One to put in a lot more work.

Since he’s still ten levels lower than he was before the reset, I have him do some more pigg battling.

I feel like he’s reacting slower than before. He’s making decisions slower too, I think. There really must be some sort of effect on his processing power. Hmm…it seems like he’s got to put in a lot more work when his AI level is lower. Maybe I should be feeding him monster cores whenever I get them, since that’s what bumps his level up. That makes the orbs I regularly get much more convenient. It’s not like I use Libertà very much.

CLACK CLACK CLACK

It looks like he defeated the pigg. I’ll have him keep fighting as we head north.

 

Superior Magic Assist is now level 5.

You’ve acquired Overspell from Superior Magic Assist.

 

That came out of nowhere, considering I’m not even fighting. This must be my servant’s doing, since Space Magic is level 3 now too.

 

OVERSPELL

Doubles both the cost and effect of your next chant.

 

I see. That’s a pretty standard ability. I can already think of situations where I can make good use of it, like when I go hunting, for instance.

I enter the northern forest. It feels pretty much the same as the one to the south—not impossible to walk through at all.

I stop for a moment. Wait, what? Did I show up at a bad time? It’s almost night now. Well, I guess it doesn’t matter. I’ll get stronger just like the enemies will. In fact, as a High Undead myself, my modifiers are even stronger than the enemies. But I suppose that depends on whether I’m restricted by my base level.

Now that I’m thinking about it, I was so focused on what was past the forest, I forgot to ask about what I might run into inside of it.

Before me is a forest wolf—the kind that hasn’t turned into a zombie yet. Forest wolves are a type of dog that stand about a meter tall, with a bit of a green tinge to them. Wait, does this game include an active sense of smell? The answer to that question must be what determines dog races. Maybe there’s information about that on the forums.

Anyway, since it’s in my path, I need to deal with this wolf. I start by striking with my Dark Lance and then have Unit One stand at my side. I could have him protect me from the front if he only had a shield. But maybe it’s better to give him a greatsword instead of a one-handed axe so he can be a real attacker? Then again, we’re in a forest right now. I’m worried about how to maneuver… Maybe it’s not such a bad idea to have him do nothing but jumping slashes for now.

I tell Unit One to wait until the enemy is targeting me and use that opportunity to attack. He’s currently attacking a foe from behind. But the wolf, clearly irritated by all the hits, kicks backward like a horse, sending Unit One’s health straight into the red zone.

“Unit One!” I cry out.

In a normal game, the area around an enemy would be safe, so long as they weren’t using an AoE attack, but that doesn’t seem to be the case in this game.

Now that I know Unit One can’t be directly behind an enemy, I decide to place him diagonally behind enemies in the future. It might be smart to equip him with a spear to put some distance between them… This is tough.

I defeat the wolf while Unit One regains HP by resting.

“Let’s change up your equipment, Unit One.”

CLACK

I resummon him because of his low HP. I also try absorbing the forest wolf and go for a 2× summoning, since a 3× costs too much for me. This should raise his stats a little more. Unit One reappears with the Sword skill and a greatsword on his back.

I like having Unit One along with me, since he raises my Secret Art of Necromancy, Undead Unifier, Undying Royalty, and Royal Privilege skills. I’ll be sure my servant puts a lot of effort in.

“You’re going to stand diagonally behind the next wolf, Unit One. Understand? Once you attack, get away from it.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

Good. We continue onward.

I want more capacity, but I’m also curious about what a forest wolf drops. Drop information…“forest wolf”…there it is. They drop pelts, fangs, and wolf meat? Yeah, I don’t need any of that. I can definitely just absorb it. If I want wolf meat, I’ll go hunting for it later. Wolves give one capacity, and forest wolves give three.

While I have the BBS up, I take a look at enemy information.

The other enemy is…aquilegia? They say it’s a plant monster with skeletal appendages hanging from it, and its weaknesses are slashing attacks and fire. Since they don’t move, they’re very easy to defeat. Their one annoying move is to suddenly wrap around you if you get too close, but we can just ignore them.

We press onward, continuing to defeat forest wolves. I spot several aquilegia along the way, but the information I read about them seems perfectly accurate, so I just pass them by.

Unit One, with his brand-new fighting style, is performing well as an attacker. That’s a good thing. I do see him miss the occasional attack, but since he’s up against wolves, that’s to be expected. I’m sure his stats aren’t very strong yet, so as long as he doesn’t die, I’m happy. I don’t have any extra capacity right now, after all.

That reminds me. When I use Dark Ritual, my Dark Magic and Alchemy skills go up, but Discern and Dismantle aren’t affected, right? This is tricky.

 

We arrive in the next area, so I recall Unit One. The enemies up ahead will be one grade higher than the ones in the last area, so I doubt my servant can keep up.

The area containing the ancient temple is still within a forest, although this one is much denser. I don’t expect there to be much light from the sun or moon in this place. It’s an unnerving forest full of the undead, where the living dares not enter.

That thing up ahead must be a revenant. It doesn’t have Decomposing Body either, so it kind of resembles a person if I ignore the tattered rags it’s wearing. Its gait is a little stiff too. Fortunately, revenants shouldn’t target me at all.

 

Suddenly, a diagonal red line tags me from above! I dodge it like my life depends on it. I look up to see a flying skull. Whew, that was close! Hmm…if it was using Dark Magic, then I guess I didn’t need to dodge its attack. Still, I guess it’s not a good idea to just let it hit me.

Just then, the revenant links up with the flying skull. It’s not attacking me, but I can still see the link marker. I’ll keep an eye on it, but for now, there isn’t anything for me to do about it.

I start up a battle of spells with the skull above me in the air. Of course, I use light magic, while the enemy uses Dark Magic. The main problem is that the skull just won’t stop flying. I’ll have to calculate the angle to shoot it from. The target preview line does appear when I start to chant a spell, but it only shows where the spell will land if I fire it at the exact same speed and angle. Changing either factor could mean I’ll just graze the enemy or miss altogether. That risk only goes up when the battle is being fought in the air instead of on land.

I use Royal Defense to handle the skull’s spells and fire back with Light Arrow and Light Lance. The lance works best against the enemy’s slow spells. It looks like two hits are enough to defeat it. The flying skull lacks durability and dies in only a hit and a half’s worth of damage or so. That’s not very good, huh? The other enemies require three whole strikes.

A few seconds after I defeat the flying skull, its link disappears, returning the revenant to a normal status. I can ignore the revenant now, so long as I don’t hit it with any of my attacks.

I undo my Inventory Expansion art from Space Magic because I need my MP back. I want to be able to use Boundary Control if I need to.

I see a quest marker in the center of this area, so that must be the ancient temple. I’ll head straight for it.

When I listen a little more closely to the nearby noises, it’s easy to hear a flying skull, since the only other sounds coming from above me are the rustle of leaves.

Maybe the enemy respawn rate here is pretty low? I think I’m the only one around. While I do have night vision, visibility still isn’t all that great here in the forest anyway.

Hmm…something’s here. That must have been my Instinct just now. There’s no way I imagined it…right?

Suddenly, my Danger Sense activates! Enemies jump out at me from three directions at once!

My Danger Sense shows me which directions I can dodge to avoid getting hit. Waltz is really putting in work. Danger Sense uses red lines to show the area of attack like in a traditional MMO, and I’m sure the accuracy only increases with its skill level. I would call this not just convenient for a solo player, but a necessity.

So these are armored skeleton wolves? They just used Shadow Magic to launch their surprise attack, and it was a closer call than I would have liked. I’m in a bad position, pinned down from three directions like this. Light Burst would probably get me out of this pinch, but I don’t want the light magic to take me out along with my enemies.

The wolves circle around me—or rather, they “triangle” around me, since there are just three. Ha ha! No, I can’t panic. I have to counter their formation.

I send Light Lance shooting out of the tip of my rapier and strike each of the wolves as they leap at me. Then I keep them away with a barrage of Light Ball and Light Arrow. I need to be sure they can’t find the right timing to attack me. Next, I change things up with Dark Burst. The wolves have some resistance to it, but my own Dark Magic is buffed. They can’t absorb or ignore it. When I see them flinch from the hits, I know it’s affecting them.

This is going better than I thought it would. Well, actually, they’re still grazing me quite a bit and whittling down my HP. I’ll need my automatic recovery skills to put up a fight. I’m at 60% HP already, so I’ll use my Dark Heal to recover. Now I’m at 80%.

 

Your race level has reached level 20. New race skills are now available.

 

Yes! These higher ranks are a nice treat. But now’s not the time to be checking over my skills. I make a note to look them over later.

Leveling up fully restores my health too. That’s much appreciated.

In front of me is a link between an armored skeleton soldier, an armored skeleton archer, and a phantom knight. They have a burst sword, a small bow, a mace, and a large shield between them. This won’t be fun.

Huh?! The archer spotted me! Aaaah, he’s running for me! He’s got a bow, so I can use Royal Counter and Royal Defense for any normal attacks. Arts allow you to easily repel attacks, but the regular parries are very hard to use, although not impossible. Danger Sense helps too, since it shows the paths where the attacks will land.

I shoot off spells at the archer until all the enemies reach me. I think I’ll stick with Boundary Control and Light Lance. How do you like that?!

Hmph, still hanging on? That’s level 36 enemies for you.

Phantom knights sure are slow, although I guess they’re still faster than me. The one attacking me uses Arrow Line…and misses entirely, hitting one of the trees instead. Ha ha ha! Bested by the power of trees! Undead aren’t smart enough to choose arts that suit the map they’re in. Is that the end for one such annoying art, here under the cover of branches?

Boundary Control has a longer cooldown, and the soldier with the sword is coming at me, so I shoot Light Arrow at the archer.

Now that I think about it, my fighting skills aren’t particularly suited for battles against skeletons. My main weapon is my magic, and my actual weapon is a rapier.

I use Break Parry to escape the oncoming soldier’s attack before jumping up into the air and firing off Light Lance while the enemy’s off-balance. Then I go in for a slash attack. Since he’s staggered, he’ll receive double damage for three seconds. But I still can’t kill him! He clearly has the right modifiers.

The phantom knight joins the battle. This is going to be annoying. He’s weak to blunt attacks and light magic. I can use the Penetrate art from Rapier, but that’s not strong against undead.

I’m still getting pelted with arrows, the phantom knight is blocking my path with his large shield right in front of me, and the soldier’s attacks are genuinely dangerous… Is this impossible after all? I’m pretty sure these are the main enemies that appear in this area…and they probably always spawn in this same combination. In other words, I’ll have to struggle through these fights if I want to continue onward. If only they were a cluster of three wolves instead! Then I could do it!

I block two incoming hits with Rapid Shoot, dodge a mace blow, jump to avoid the sword again, and farewell, soldier! Next is the archer, who’s on his last sliver of HP.

I have 60% HP remaining, so I need to heal when I get the chance. But first, I’ll hit the archer with Light Arrow… Hmm?! Wait, hang on! There’s a skeleton dog coming at me! There, there…good doggy… Argh! Hey!

I’ll just have to finish off the archer once and for all…if only this skeleton dog would please stop chomping on my arm! The phantom knight swings his mace down at me, so I use the skeleton dog attached to my arm as a shield.

I cast Dark Burst, then Light Arrow. Finally, I managed to kill the archer.

A canine arm shield is a pretty good defense against the mace. Farewell, skeleton dog. But farewell to me as well, as the mace is a blunt weapon. May I do a better job on the battlefield in my next life…

Oof.

 

Hello, new me. I’m home, in Starting Town.

 

Death Penalty: All stats temporarily reduced, lowered EXP gain rate, half of gold on hand removed.

You have lost your left arm.

 

Farewell, left arm. The left one again, huh? I seem to lose that one all the time. Well, perhaps that’s an exaggeration.

“Ah! Hey, Sis!”

“Huh? Oh, Rina.”

“Sis! Where’s your arm?!”

“I lost it. Please congratulate me.”

“That’s not really worth congratulating…”

Time to use some parts. I select dark parts and then go to the left arm section. When I press the new arm that appears into the missing spot, it fuses back into my body. For the next three hours, my left arm won’t be as responsive when I use it.

I place the ring and vambrace in my inventory back on my arm, and then I’m good as new.

“Sis is back from the dead… Where’d you die?”

“The third area. It was too much for me, both in level and in location.”

“Ah…next to the second area, then. You die if you get surrounded there, right?”

“Yeah. I couldn’t make it out alive once reinforcements showed up.”

“You went solo?”

“I just wanted to check the place out.”

I use Inventory Expansion from Space Magic again.

It’s almost time for dinner IRL. I’m sure Mom and Dad are home already, and I may as well log out while my death penalties are active. I say goodbye to my sister, head to the inn, and log out.

 

Mom and Dad are in the living room when I arrive…but why are they drinking already? The drivers are drinking too. I guess our guests have no intention of leaving anytime soon…not that I expected them to leave in the first place. I don’t see the maids around, though.

I grab a juice and tune in to Akina’s livestream. She has over 10,000 viewers right now. That’s even more eyes on her than the principal gets during a school-wide assembly. It looks like Akina’s escorting Ms. Primura while she goes out to gather supplies in Imbamunte.

Ms. Primura does carpentry, so Rina would normally be with Mr. Ertz, the blacksmith, but I guess her party must have needed Ms. Primura’s help. Ms. Nadia and Ms. Helen do carpentry too, as I recall.

Ms. Nadia and Ms. Helen show up to help out along the way.

“Those are the two girls who ate lunch with us here. Ms. Yanase is Nadia, with the ukulele; and Ms. Matsukane is Helen, with the bow,” I explain to my parents.

“Oh, so that’s who they are.”

I watch the stream while I steal the snacks that are meant to go along with the adults’ alcohol. Meanwhile, the maids return. It looks like they were out shopping…in their maid uniforms. They bring us ingredients for dinner, snacks, liquor, and juice.

 

Dinner prep ends up involving nothing more than setting up the grill in the garden. Dad is preparing the meat as a main dish while the maids take the job of skewering it. I suppose I should call Rina down via chat comment. “Dinner’s ready, Rina.” The purple text goes passing by. It looks like she chose that color for my comments in advance.

“Yay! It’s meat time!”

“Come out to the garden.”

“We’re really having a barbecue, aren’t we?”

“Barbecue…in the garden?!” A bunch of chat comments expressing their shock get posted all at once, but I’ll leave my sister to handle them.

I light the grill, prepare water, and begin to cook.

“Meat!”

“Here’s your tofu.”

“Tofu…? Oh, soybeans—meat of the earth. Well, at least you didn’t just hand me plain soybeans.”

“And here’s your soy sauce.”

Tofu makes for a wonderful palate cleanser, although I suppose I made her eat it before she had anything else. All I did was find it in the fridge.

 

I take out the meat Dad had prepared and salted.

Then I change it up a little in a way that most families probably don’t do for a barbecue. I apply a spice rub of sugar and other seasonings to the meat and smoke it at a low temperature.

All that’s left is to let it cook now. I coat it with a little sauce and fire up the grill.

 

Along with the sounds of the sizzling meat, I can also hear a conversation between Mom and her boss, Mr. Noah.

“So why’d you come all the way here?” Mom asks him.

“Because I wanted to try something new, of course.”

“What do you mean?”

“Companies with special patents are currently in negotiations with Future Software. Maybe not as a friend but as a CEO…I want to scout little Tasha!”

Huh? I know Mom already told him not to scout me, since I get to decide my own future…but now he wants me as a CEO? Did something happen that I’m forgetting about?

Mom is now jokingly strangling him.

“Do you know what he’s talking about, Eli?”

“Mm…I haven’t asked him directly, but I have a general idea.”

“Hmm?”

“Do you like fantasy stuff, Tasha?”

“I suppose I don’t hate it.”

“You’d never play that game if you hated it.”

“That’s true.”

She’s nodding her head like this pleases her, but I still have no idea what we’re talking about.

“Father. Explain it to her, please,” Eli requested.

“Right… But first…Tasha, could you…get your mother to…let me go?”

Mom’s still got a grip on him? Well, it sounds like Mr. Noah is ready to tell me about it now.

“Oof… Ah, I have to keep it quiet for a while still. It’s a state secret!”

“Liar. This is company business, right?”

“Well, to put it as simply as possible, it’s about VR idols.”

“Idols?”

How is Mom even capable of a growl like that?

“Was that too simple?”

“Father…an idol refers to something else, you know.”

“Then maybe ‘VR actress’ would be more accurate?”

I decide to ask for more details, since this is about my future, and I learn that new FDVR technology is being used to make movies.

In other words, once Mr. Noah saw how realistic Future Software’s commercials, trailers, and livestreams were, he theorized that the content could be recorded and turned into movies.

The only problem is that an FDVR movie would have to consist entirely of stuntmen, essentially. It’s nothing more than having a flashy playstyle, which makes things hard on the actress. But if you replace the actress with a stuntwoman, then you need to dub over the whole thing, making this no easy endeavor.

“To me that sounds impossible,” I say.

“Yeah…it is.” Mom doesn’t play video games, after all.

Since this would all take place in VR, you could give someone the same avatar to perform as another person, but that replacement would have to be well versed in FDVR, acting, and combat to top it all off. Besides, it’s much better to have the main character of a movie be consistent.

Using a hyper-realistic medium like FDVR means you don’t want it to feel unrealistic in any other way. You want it to feel as seamless as possible.

“Also, wouldn’t it generate more buzz if you really had the same person doing everything, considering it’s a brand-new use of technology?”

“Well, I’m sure it would be more interesting than if you used a stand-in…” I replied.

“It’s a game, so the battles can be as eye-catching as you want! Send spells flying back and forth! And they’re in charge of all the fantasy costumes.” Mr. Louis is flashing the peace sign.

Now I see his plan. In other words, he wants to use FDVR to create an incredibly realistic fantasy movie.

“Won’t it be too gory…?”

“But FLFO already has settings for gore. Can’t we play with that to get by?”

I see… Well, I’m sure he’ll think of something, since he’s a professional.

“Filming a realistic game to make a movie… Of course, you’ll have to adjust the angles and effects, right?”

“Of course.”

“And you’ll be coming up with a story?”

“Naturally.”

My sister speaks up. “I wanna see that!”

“You do, don’t you?!”

Mr. Noah and my sister are getting all excited, but…hmm…

Even livestreams of the game are pretty hype-inducing, and the official trailers and such gather huge amounts of views too. They could get rid of the Japanese server requirements and allow connections from overseas as well… Well, it sounds like they’re still thinking about it.

“This is still a ways off, right?” I ask.

“Right. Like I said, we’re in the negotiation stage, so it might not end up going anywhere. But my instincts tell me this would be a box-office hit. I think Future Software will go for it too. Still, it’ll be two more years at the very earliest, I think.”

“Make your own choice. I’ll support you if this is what you want, but if it’s not, I’ll make him back down,” says Eli.

“Feel free to take some time to think about it. Ah, but be careful of things like VR idol contracts. If you sign one of those, it’ll be harder to join our company in the future.”

I’d use the word “impossible” myself.

“But, Tasha, if you become a VR idol, you’ll never get to show off your real body.”

“That’s true. I don’t like the sound of that, but I’m not interested in being an idol in the first place.”

I watched my mom work, after all. She’s an actress, not an idol. I don’t want to go on silly variety shows. But aside from that…looking at this realistically, I just got scouted by one of the most famous CEOs in the world, right here in my own backyard.

Think about the money…

“Do VR actresses get to show their IRL bodies?”

“Ha ha! Is that what you think of my company? Of course they can show them off! If you go for the same path as your mother, you’ll be walking the red carpet someday down the line!”

“Also, Tasha!” Abby chimes in. “Everyone will be so surprised to see the VR character IRL!”

Does she have a point there?

“That’s true, Sis. VR players rarely make public appearances. You’ve gotta go for it!”

“If you want to join her, Rina, then put a little more work into your RP! I know your personality and background, and I know you’re great at full-dive games, so that just leaves the acting part! We’re professionals, so we won’t compromise in that regard. It’s really important when you’re just starting out!”

Yeah, they wouldn’t scout every top player just for the heck of it. Some of them already have jobs, or maybe they’re students, or maybe their personalities and backgrounds aren’t easy to figure out. A bunch of research would have to go into a player they really want to scout.

“Aside from my movements, I’m not exactly roleplaying at all…although I did go kind of crazy during the events. I had lines prepared for me and everything.”

“If you want it, then go for it!”

In other words, I’m supposed to do more roleplaying in the game as practice? I’m sure it’s faster to learn acting when you’re enjoying yourself, so I suppose I get it…

Well, it’s still two years away at the earliest, so I’ll be able to graduate high school, at least. I’ll take some time and think about it.

We chat some more as we eat, take our baths, and then the four of us girls have what basically amounts to a slumber party before bed. I mentally apologize to Mr. Skelly…but then I remember I can simply send him a message to explain the situation.


# Chapter 2: Friday—The Day Before Summer Break
 

I WAKE UP in the morning, prepare for the day ahead, and glance out at the garden. There I see Eli elegantly sipping from a cup of tea, so I head straight for her.

“Is Abby still asleep?” I ask.

“I assume she’ll be up soon.”

It’s almost 7 a.m. I imagine she can’t sleep much longer.

Letty hands me a cup of black tea. I spend a few peaceful moments with Eli until Abby shows up.

“Good morning.”

“Morning, Abby.”

“Did you sleep well?”

“I sure did!”

Abby joins us, becoming the third member of our breakfast party.

We kill time at our own pace, as my sister and I will be driven to school together today.

“It’s too early for it to be this scorching. We won’t be able to enjoy any tea once it gets even hotter than this,” says Eli.

“It’s usually better to stay inside during the summer.”

“How do you ever get by?”

“We stay close to the air conditioner.”

“I see…”

It’s impossible to relax unless the temperature is tolerable. Heat alone is hard enough to bear, but the humidity only makes it even more torturous.

Shortly before school begins, one of the drivers steps forward and heads off to the car. Abby’s maid, Dory, arrives with Akina, and the three of us leave for school. Eli and Abby stay at home, of course. The inside of the car is nice and cool—the driver must have turned the AC on in advance.

We arrive at school in the limousine, and the driver drops us off in the staff parking lot.

“Shall I wait here until you’re ready to return home?”

“Well…they said it’s just one ceremony, and then we get our report cards and leave, but I don’t know how long the ceremony itself will last.”

“I imagine it won’t be more than two hours. I’ll wait here for your return.”

I’m sure I don’t have to worry about the driver breaking that promise. I exit the limousine and head to class.

“Mornin’!”

“Morning!”

“Good morning.”

“I haven’t seen that car in a while!”

“But you’ve actually seen it?”

“Yeah, a while back, though.”

The people I went to elementary and junior high school with certainly might have seen a limo before. I was dropped off in one many times over the years.

Mom and Dad don’t currently have the slightest interest in cars, so the one we have at home is entirely normal. They said all that really matters is that it can drive. They prefer things like cosmetics and electronics.

I chat with my classmates while everyone else shows up to class. Eventually, the bell rings.

“All right, kids!” our teacher calls out. “Get to your seats for attendance… Oh, you’re all here, huh?”

All it took was one glance to determine that, apparently.

“There was some sort of crazy car parked out back. I almost jumped out of my skin when I saw it! Whose is that?”

“That would be Kotone’s.”

“It belongs to a friend who’s staying at my house.”

“Ah…I see. Well, that explains it. All right, let’s get to today’s schedule. We’ll do the ceremony first, then I’ll give you your report cards, and you’re free to leave after that. The exact length of the ceremony comes down to how long the principal talks for, so pray he keeps it quick.”

I don’t think our principal will drag it out too much. The driver probably won’t have to wait very long.

We head out to the ceremony. It ends up finishing so quickly, we don’t even have time to zone out before the principal wraps up. I think that was a good choice. He hit all the important points instead of rattling on, which meant he kept our attention to the end.

Then we return to the classroom, receive our report cards, and prepare to go back home.

“We couldn’t do this yesterday?”

“The grown-ups at the school had something to do with that. In fact, they wanted your last day to fall on their last day.”

“Whaaaat?!”

“My vacation starts today too! I don’t know how many of you in this class are joining tomorrow’s FLFO patch, but don’t forget your homework! Hey, don’t make a fuss; just do the work if you don’t want to get in trouble. Like the principal said, be really careful if you’re gonna vacation at any spots like rivers or the beach. Okay, that’s it for me. Dismissed!”

“I’m glad that didn’t take long, but now it’s like…why the hell did we have to come here for this?”

“Pipe down, Suguru. I’m sure we’re all thinking that.”

“I’m just glad Ms. Dory and the driver didn’t have to wait too long.”

“Oh, they’re still waiting? Let’s get going, then.”

Suguru, Tomohiro, and I head to the car to see that my sister and her two friends are already inside. We head home without any further delay.

 

Our friends go their separate ways once the car arrives at home. It’s still early in the afternoon, which means they’ll surely be logging into the game soon. I hope they have a safe trip back.

“We’re home,” my sister and I say in unison.

“Welcome back. You’re early today.”

We hand over our report cards to our parents, change clothes, and return to the living room.

“Looks like, as usual, there’s nothing here we need to address.”

I got all 5s, while Rina got half 4s and half 5s. Mom’s right—this is exactly how our grades have always been. The consistency is a good thing.

We chat for about half an hour until the CEOs and their families have to leave, so I see them off.

“See you in the game, Tasha, Rina.”

“Until next time!”

“Yes, see you soon.”

“Remember to think it over, Tasha!”

“I’ll try to keep roleplaying on the brain from time to time.”

“Exactly. See ya!”

Abby, who’s holding my sister’s hand, bounces up in the air with her before getting in the car. What was that all about?

Eli leaves with a “Good day” before joining them in the car. “Good day” is truly a phrase that works in any situation—not that many people still use it.

It sounds like Mom and Dad are going out on another date now that the guests are gone. Akina says goodbye and rushes back to her room for some gaming. I suppose I’ll do the same.

 

When I log in, I’m at the central plaza of Starting Town.

A message from Mr. Skelly says, “I’ve taken up Alchemy. I’ll report my findings on the BBS.” Yeah, I knew about that. I’ll leave things up to him.

Let’s see… Ah, that’s right. I unlocked some new race skills, didn’t I? These look the most interesting from what I’ve seen.

 

LUST FOR LIFE

Grants a small chance of revival when defeated in battle.

 

LIFE ABSORPTION

Absorbs enemy HP during close-quarters battles. Amount of HP absorbed is relative to skill level.

 

AUTOMATIC MP REGEN

Regain MP relative to skill level.

 

SPECIAL AUTOMATIC REGEN

Increases the effect of automatic regen skills. Become a specialist in the art of resurrection.

 

I definitely want Automatic MP Regen…but it wants 3 SP for each of these race skills. I’ll have 9 left if I take them all. To make sure I get the right skills, I’ll ignore that strange Lust for Life skill for now and take the other 3. That leaves 12 SP.

Next, I change Unit One’s Physical Immunity to Life Absorption. His Physical Immunity level is just too low to make any difference. Although, that’s the fault of my own Secret Art of Necromancy skill being low. I add Special Automatic Regen too, since my Undying Royalty skill is at 20 now.

This would be a good time to go buy some new equipment for Unit One, but Mr. Ertz probably isn’t around right now. I’ll sell some things at the shop, buy a mace, and head north. It looks like it’s finally time to acquire Mine. I’ll sacrifice the rest of my SP for it.

If I remember correctly, the weapons shop is next to the adventurers’ union.

Is it just me, or is metal equipment really expensive? Now I don’t know what to buy. I want something for blunt strikes during this trip north, but it’s hard to commit 30,000 gold for something I’m going to swap out after no time at all. Maybe I’ll go for copper instead of bronze, and I’ll also buy a round shield while I’m at it. The cost comes out to 8,000 gold.

Without any further delay, I set up Unit One’s equipment. The mace falls into the Polearm category instead of Sword. But he’s still not at the right skill level for Defend. Unless he raises it soon, the shield will be little more than a decoration.

Time to head to the northern city of Welshtead… Actually, I’ll sign up for some hunting quests from the union first. I end up with orders for rabbit, wolf, stone caterpillar, and stone turtle culls, which I’ll leave up to Unit One.

I summon him at the northern gates. He’s equipped with a copper mace and a round shield now.

“All right, Unit One. Take out any rabbits that approach us.”

CLACK

I watch as Unit One handles the rabbits, and I stick my dismantling knife into their bodies once they’re dead. I should probably repair this knife soon. I’ll ask Mr. Ertz to take care of it later.

Once Unit One’s health falls below 60%, I cast Dark Heal on him as I follow along from behind. My Life Absorption level is pretty low, but I don’t really know how it works either, so it’s hard to relax at the moment.

I dismantle the wolves and rabbits for their meat, since it always comes in handy. When I finish up the quests from the union, we head north. I don’t personally need any drops from the caterpillars and turtles, so I’ll absorb them for rituals. It’s always important to increase my capacity.

 

The path north starts to get more and more sloped as we go, while the plains grow less grassy. In its place, I can see the soil now. We are yet to reach the rocky terrain we’re heading for.

The enemies change along with the environment, meaning I now see stone caterpillars and stone turtles spawning. The caterpillars have rugged, rocky backs, while the turtles are essentially just walking around with boulders for shells.

In other words, they’re slower but have better defense. Blunt attacks and magic will be very effective on them, and therefore, this area of the map is suited for players starting out with those two weapon types. It’s easy to take in my surroundings from this spot, and I even see a few other players around.

“Go ahead, Unit One.”

CLACK CLACK

He swings his mace down hard against the sluggish turtle. With each powerful blow, the sound of metal against stone rings out.

All I do is stand and watch. Secret Art of Necromancy won’t level up at all unless Unit One puts in the work. I need him to raise it high enough for me to be able to take him along wherever I go.

I’m sure my combat skills won’t rise very much here in the starting area anyway. The combat skills I have are already at their second tiers.

 

Secret Art of Necromancy is now level 5.

Secret Art of Necromancy has unlocked Life Assignment.

 

LIFE ASSIGNMENT

This skill can only be used at half stamina or more. Transfer 1% of your HP at a time to any servant. Skill ceases when the servant is fully recovered, you cancel the skill, or your stamina falls to below half capacity.

If the player has multiple servants, 1% of player HP will transfer to each servant.

 

It may be a second-tier skill, but it still levels up quickly in the beginning. How nice.

So this is an art for servant HP recovery? At most, my own HP will decrease in increments of 6%. I can use this and Dark Heal together, along with automatic HP regen skills…and Life Absorption too? Wow, Undead really do have it good, as long as we don’t run into any light magic types.

I use the ritual to absorb the corpses that keep piling up while I’m busy checking on skills. How sad that they still only give a capacity of one.

My Unit One has a number of buffs that allow him to function with ease in this beginner’s area with all its beginner’s costs. He also managed to get by in the second-tier area where the costs were doubled, so I’ll make him the attacker when we encounter bosses.

“I’m going to resummon you, Unit One.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

I think I’ll do a max summoning this time at three times the base cost in order to raise my hunting efficiency. Summoning at the base cost is more than enough to do some good hunting, but the stronger my servant, the more my numbers go up.

It may be a good idea to summon one of the fast skeleton wolves to grind quickly, but they’re not suited hunting grounds. I’ll keep Unit One as a skeleton for now. I summon him again and follow from behind.

I remember the northern boss being a rock golem, but now that it’s been defeated, it supposedly appears as a weaker mini-rock golem. I wonder if I can use Dark Ritual on it. Since I might be able to get golem blueprints, I’ve got to try absorbing it.

The turtles that previously took four shots to defeat now only take two. I absorb their bodies and press onward to reach the boss.

Hmm…should I take on the boss once my Secret Art of Necromancy is at level 10? At that point, I’ll be able to summon a Unit Two. I’ll also earn more base skills to set them up with. What if I could summon a red skeleton? All right, let’s raise this skill.

 

Secret Art of Necromancy is now level 10. You have earned 1 skill point.

You have earned Necromancy through Secret Art of Necromancy.

 

NECROMANCY

Attach undead attributes to any target.

 

So that means I can make things more vulnerable to light and holy magic? I bet I can purify them too. But the enemies will also become more resistant to Dark Magic, so I’ll have to only use this one in parties. I doubt I’ll find any use for it on my own.

Wait, hang on a minute… Can I use it on party members so that my buffs will affect them too? This requires further testing. If I can use it on party members, it will be a good idea to—wait, no. There’s a problem with regeneration restrictions. I’m sure they don’t have Special Automatic Regen, so this will just hurt them in the end. Hmm…

Well, either way, I reached my goal, so it’s time to give Unit One Defend.

I resummon Unit One with a 3× cost, leaving me with 40 capacity, so I can summon a Unit Two at a 2× cost. However, since I don’t know much about the golem, maybe it’s better to keep my costs down for the moment. I’ll go with Unit One alone instead. I’m at the point where I can summon him as a red skeleton or high zombie, but I can’t stomach those high costs.

“Unit One, when the enemy strikes at the ground, you have to jump.”

CLACK

“Also, try not to be behind it.”

CLACK

“You’ll be facing an enemy who uses blunt attacks, so your life depends on how you dodge them. Prioritize evasion instead of getting damage in.”

CLACK

“Let’s get going, then.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

I use Dark Enchant to raise my own intelligence stat. With that, we head on in.

 

The look of the area is generally the same as the rest of the place, but there’re now large rolling boulders. There’s a different color on the map to indicate that we’re in a boss area.

The system takes control of my body, showing me how one of the tumbling boulders rolls all the way down to the golem.

It stands on two teardrop-shaped legs, has an elliptical torso, and sports two round arms. Its appendages seem to be floating around the creature, as I can’t see any joints. It also spins its arms sometimes.

A real golem is supposed to tower over you, but this mini-golem is really only as tall as an adult man.

It swings its arms back, howls at the sky, and with that, the battle begins. This isn’t the first game where I’ve had this thought…but how does a thing like that have a voice?

Putting that thought aside, I get straight to the task at hand. I use Magia Amp and Overspell to shoot a bulkier Dark Lance at the golem.

Oh, that took off over 20% of its health already. That makes sense, considering that it’s a low rank, it’s already been weakened by its first defeat, and it has a weakness to magic. I don’t think this will be a hard fight at all.

It stomps toward me, its legs planted wide apart, but I send the creature off with a gift of Light Lance before it can get too close. It hits, but the golem swings its right arm down all the same. I crouch, hold my rapier up to receive the blow, and see that Unit One is hitting the golem’s left leg from the side.

The golem doesn’t have many attack patterns, and it’s easy to see what’s coming based on its telegraphed animations. It swings its arm at you, rolls around if you get behind it, stomps when its stamina is low, and punches with its left arm.

The right arm swings. The left arm punches. The cry it let out during the intro cutscene is for when it’s about to roll. When it raises the right arm up, it’s time for a stomp.

The biggest headache is that left straight punch. It never even does the rolling move if you don’t go behind it. As for the stomp, well, you just jump up in the air. Arm swings can be stopped with a blade.

The main problem is that, even as a mini-golem, its arms are still bigger than me. They’re practically impossible to parry…meaning its attack knocks me off my feet. I guess you can say that size matters in a time like this. Although it can be a curse as much as it is a blessing, depending on the situation…

I feel like jumping to escape the blows might be my best option when fighting a huge monster like this. In real life, my bones would definitely snap, but in the game, the hits send you flying. That would be a problem when you’re in a party, but you can just use the Heavy Stand art with a large shield to stand your ground.

That’s the only real problem, though. If I continue using Overspell to shoot Dark Lance and Light Lance whenever I get the chance, I should be able to win just fine.

“Time to jump, Unit One.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

Oh, the boss lifted up its right arm. As soon as it slams it down into the ground, we see an effect activate, which Unit One and I both jump to avoid. Considering how close we are, we end up jumping the exact moment the arm touches the ground.

The stomping animation is really dramatic, but the golem can barely defend itself at all after using that move, so that’s our time to strike. Then I shoot more spells at it while Unit One and I both get in some good hits.

We jump to perfectly dodge the second stomp, and finally, Unit One delivers the finishing blow to its leg. The golem collapses and dissolves into pieces.

 

Darkness Magic is now level 5.

You have learned Nox Shot through Darkness Magic.

Your servant level has increased.

Defeating the northern boss has allowed you access to the north. You also receive 3 SP for your successful battle.

 

CLACK CLACK CLACK

“We got some good skill grinding in, so I’m happy with this.”

So I know Nox Shot now? It’s a powerful and fast chant, but its range is dreadfully short. It’s more like a shotgun spell.

Now it’s time for the Dark Ritual.

 

Your Dark Ritual grants you the materials for a Mini Golem.

Dark Ritual increases your capacity by 3.

 

Hmm… So now I can make a skeleton mini-golem and a mini-golem zombie? They’re small, but once they evolve, they become a medium-sized golem. I just don’t have enough capacity for that…

 

Time to head to the town. I’ll summon Unit Two while I’m at it. He’ll have Sword…and I think I’ll give him Footwork or Strength Boost too. As for how something without muscle can gain strength, well, it’s best not to think about it too hard.

Since I’ll be giving him a greatsword, I think I’ll set him up with Balance Control. I also decide to keep the race skills the same, and commence the summoning!

“…You’re both Unit One, aren’t you?”

CLACK

“Well, I’ll call the first one I summoned Unit One, and the next one will be Unit Two. You’ve used a greatsword before, so you know what to do, right?”

CLACK

“All right. Let’s get going.”

We leave the boss area and head onward. For now, my goal is to unlock the portal, but hunting can wait until later. I also need to find out where I can mine ore.

There’s still so much to do, but that’s a good thing.

This second area where Welshtead lies isn’t so different. The whole place is covered in rock caterpillars and turtles instead of the stone ones we were fighting.

But they’re a lot bigger, huh? Out of the corner of my eye, I watch Unit One and Unit Two beat up a turtle while I look around.

Both the Starting Town and eastern regions are made up of plains and woods. The south lines a large ocean, while this area to the north has plenty of mountains. They must be where I’ll find those ores. The mountains look entirely brown.

I perform the ritual and absorb the enemies that Units One and Two defeated, then head to town. Striking those armored enemies with a greatsword only damaged it a little faster than normal. But since the one mace is the sole blunt weapon I have, it’s really my only option.

Should I really turn Unit Two into a golem? Punches are the same as blunt strikes, I’m sure. The only problem is that a golem costs 400 capacity. I really don’t have enough to cover it, and a mini-golem is no different from a skeleton, so I may as well stick with what I have.

Fighting in the second area increased my capacity, so I might be able to change after defeating a few more enemies. I receive 15 capacity in exchange for those victories.

“I’m going to resummon you, Unit Two.”

CLACK

This time, he’s coming back as a skeleton mini-golem. We’ll start with a base skill of Fist. The new Unit Two looks like the boss mini-golem but with an outer shell of bones, which isn’t very protective.

“Punch any turtles you see, Unit Two.”

The light shell of bones allows him to nimbly creep up and deliver a straight right punch. Then I hear a surprisingly loud crunch and immediately come to notice a fatal flaw.

It feels like I fell into a trap… “Unit One, swap places with Unit Two.”

CLACK CLACK CLACK

I make them swap places again after Unit One attacks. Skeleton golems certainly have some problems, huh? Golems fight bare-handed, while skeletons are more easily damaged by blunt hits. Therefore, I’m now in this ridiculous situation where Unit Two is taking damage from the recoil of its own strikes.

I’ll resummon him as a mini-golem zombie instead. That will give him some meat on those bones.

This is trickier than I thought. Skeletons can use weapons, but they can hardly withstand body blows, even from something as weak as rabbits. But what if I give him custom arms? I could put arms on his back to hold weapons, which might make him more powerful against the quick-footed wolves.

Well, with all this customization available, I can probably do whatever I want. I don’t know how to judge any of it without information in advance, so there’s no choice but to try it out.

“Let’s try that again, Unit Two.”

The sound his attack produced this time wasn’t as striking, but it dealt plenty of damage. His stamina still looks fine too. Golems really do work best as zombies. The problem is Decomposing Body. I doubt he’ll be able to get rid of it any time soon. It’s a matter of skill level and capacity.

We press onward, defeating enemies along the way, and once I spot the town, I recall my servants.

“Welcome to Welshtead, a humble mining town!” the gatekeeper greets me.

I say hello back and head inside.

There’s a lot of smoke coming from one corner of the city, which makes sense considering the mining work they do here. That must be a street for craftsmen. Judging by the passing residents, this area seems to have a lot of dwarves.

It’s by no means a small town. I get the sense that there’re lots of blacksmiths, miners, and even adventurers here. Metallic gear looks cheap here too, and I’ll bet that’s because they gather the materials themselves. Lots of the adventurers are residents, of course, but I also see plenty of players around too.

I sightsee just a little bit before unlocking the portal.

“Oh? Yo, Stasia. Didn’t expect to find you here.”

“Hey, Sugu. I’m glad I found you.”

“What’s up?”

“Do you know where I can mine some iron ore?”

“You can do that in pretty much any of the mountains in this area…well, except those ones. Over there, that’s where you can mine.”

“There’re mountains that don’t have ores?”

“It’s part of the game’s story. The townspeople are currently using those. But since the ones over there are already pretty stripped of resources, they’re free to use. The idea is to make your choice but be ready for the consequences.”

“I see. So you’ll cause trouble for the townspeople if you mine without their permission.”

“You can’t even enter the mine shafts that they’re using, so if you find a hole that lets you go in, it means you can use it.”

“That’s nice. It makes it easy to tell the difference.”

“By the way, there will be enemies there too, of course. Ants, ants, and ants.”

“There’re three kinds of ants?”

“Ants with spears, fighting ants, and ants that shoot acid at you. You’ll just need light… Actually, I guess not.”

“I have my night vision, so I’ll be fine.”

I could picture the townsfolk ending a hard day’s work in the mines, only to be met with ants… Maybe they don’t mind us mining in certain mountains if it means we’ll defeat ants for them at the same time? It saves both time and work for them.

“The enemies themselves aren’t too strong, but there are a ton of them. You’ll have to fight two or three at once in those mine shafts, and they keep coming at you for a while.”

“So they’re the kinds of enemies that come in waves?”

“You’ll be able to excavate more the further down you go, but there’ll be more ants there too. Right now, you can get iron, nickel, and cobalt.”

Supposedly, we can’t use nickel or cobalt right now. We’re mostly looking for iron, with steel still being down the line a bit. Hang in there, Mr. Ertz.

Without any firepower, the endless attacks from the ants will probably make mining a real pain in the ass.

Sugu will be in the north for a while with his party to craft some new equipment.

“Oh? Hey, you two.”

“Ah, hi there, Cecil,” Sugu responds.

“Long time no see,” I say.

“Yeah, I’ve been in the west lately. But I heard I could get steel soon, so I came here for upgrades. Believe it or not, my party still uses bronze!”

Oh, so they’re on the verge of an upgrade? Then maybe I should work on providing my servants with steel equipment too. I ask him about the prices.

“I made pretty decent profits, and we’ve gained new members as well, so I decided to change things up.”

“I made good money during the tournament too.”

“Yeah, I remember the line outside your booth.”

We chat for a while, but lunchtime arrives IRL, so I log out. Once I’m finished eating, I log right back in again.

 

I check to make sure the bronze pickaxe I bought from Mr. Ertz is still in my inventory, and finally, it’s time to head to the mountains. I use 3 SP to acquire Mine while I’m at it.

I head to one of the mountains Sugu specified and spot a good few entrances to mine shafts. Standing there and staring at them won’t help me decide, so I enter more than one and take a look around each.

The mine shafts barely seem wide enough for a mini-golem to move around in, but I think a skeleton with a mace, shield, and greatsword might fit.

I need to raise my hunting efficiency in this area… I need to be sure I don’t get killed too, so I summon my servants with a 3× cost multiplier. That should give them a 1.5 stat multiplier to their stats like before. I wonder if that applies to bone density too…

Ignoring that question for now, we travel straight through into the mine shaft. The pathway is wider than I expected inside, probably to haul out ores and such. A more meta reason for the size might be so that we can properly battle in here.

The shaft starts to branch off after a while, making this trip more complicated. But my mini-map is updating automatically, so there’s no need to hesitate. It’s a game, after all, so we shouldn’t have to walk around with a pen and paper in hand the whole time.

We continue into the mine shaft until I spot a light shining from the wall. Well, that’s quite handy, isn’t it? I take out my pickaxe and begin to swing.

Mining in this game simply means that you can obtain the item you see in front of you. It isn’t a flashy graphic in the game, and it’s similar to how I can actually pick any medicinal herbs and mushrooms that I come across. These stones enter my inventory the moment I pick them up.

Of course, since this is a game, the materials will respawn after some time. There’s also no need to feel guilty about gathering from these spawn points, as they are unique to each player. Sure, it’s not realistic, but it’s better than getting into fights over hoarding, I’m sure. That said, gathering materials depends on a player’s skills and equipment, so it’s not guaranteed that everyone can collect everything they’re looking for in the first place.

Just like in most games, this light on the wall is telling me that I can gather materials here. However, the light in FLFO also tells me how many times I can dig and how many ores I’ll receive. The players refer to this as a god-tier mechanic. Apparently, there are random places within the game area where the materials also respawn automatically. In other words, if you take lumber from a special tree, another tree in the same area starts to give the same bonuses as the first.

All players share the same bonus spots, but it’s not too appealing when you think about having to compete over who gets to gather from them. It sounds like there’re multiple spots in each area, and once harvested, they transfer to another random location, so the whole thing isn’t very productive.

 

I continue swinging my pickaxe into the wall, causing the clang of each blow to echo throughout the mine shaft. Units One and Two are standing guard nearby.

The pieces that come off the wall include iron and copper ore. Well, it’s all going to Mr. Ertz anyway, so I don’t care what I get. Maybe the reason I’m mostly finding copper is because it’s still too early before I can mine anything else. Either way, I’ll head to the next spot now.

Oh, here come some enemies. Those are definitely the kinds of ants you only see in games: a little cartoonish, with hands gripping a spear. This must mean the empty-handed ants are the ones that fight with their fists. There’re two ant lancers and one ant fighter, but I don’t see any of the acid-throwing kind yet. My servants can handle the lancers.

“Unit One, take out the two with the spears.”

CLACK

Spears are stabbing weapons, so the servants should be able to handle them. Meanwhile, since there’s only one, I’ll take care of the ant fighter and its blunt attacks. This dark mine shaft hidden away from the sun makes for a perfect hunting ground. I doubt they can sneak up on us in these tunnels.

The fighter ant holds up its fists and charges at me on its multiple legs, while the lancer runs at me with its spear at the ready. These creatures are actually pretty speedy.

I cast Light Lance at the approaching fighter to draw him my way. Unit One and Unit Two stand in front of the lancers.

The fighter had gathered momentum into its straight right punch, but I manage to dodge it anyway and slash to my left to hit its undefended side. I then dispatch Nox Shot and begin to chant Light Lance. The fighter ant recoils from Nox Shot, causing it to miss its next punch, and then I dispatch the spell.

It looks like the ants’ joints are their weak points, so I aim for them with my rapier and spells. I glance to my side and see that despite Unit One having a spear stuck in his rib cage, he still manages to smack his mace into the ant’s head. So the skeleton doesn’t take any damage in that empty space, huh… The bones are hard to stab into, and even when the blow lands, they don’t take much damage from it. Of course, if the enemy had a hammer or something, it would be game over.

I use Break Parry to jump up and dodge the punches, slash into the ant’s weak spots, and cast another Nox Shot. This finishes off the ant for good.

Projectile spells are most convenient, although, people who play this game with spells alone probably have difficulty aiming them. They fly over ten meters away, after all. These spells are probably priceless to those who specialize in magic and weaponry together. I really want to get Lumen Shot soon, so I’ll focus on using light magic for a while. It doesn’t pack as much of a punch, but that’s not important.

As for Unit One and Unit Two… I’ll go take out Unit Two’s opponent first. I jump in front of the lancer and use the rapier art Penetrate on its weak spot. The rapier glows red with the art, and once I’m aiming at the right point, what looks like a laser shoots out of the tip and pierces the lancer’s body, producing an eye-catching visual effect. The game is acknowledging that I hit the ant’s weak spot.

With its side cut open, the lancer stumbles, and Unit Two uses the opportunity to strike it with his greatsword, sending the foe to the grave.

I send Unit Two back to help Unit One and absorb the ant with Dark Ritual. It looks like they managed to defeat the other lancer with a full swing of a greatsword from the side, then another full swing of a mace to its head when it stumbled. They both called out their moves, so it sounds like they’re perfectly synchronized.

I’m seeing that individual enemies on their own aren’t very strong. These may be ants, but they’re large ones, so I receive 3 capacity for each kill. Now that’s what I’m looking for. This was a difficult fight for the servants, so I restore their health. Maybe I can leave small amounts of damage to auto-regen. If things get bad, then I can resort to Life Assignment.

I continue forward, mining from the walls occasionally, when I hear the sounds of combat from up ahead. Other people must be here. The further I go, the more the path branches off, so I might actually be heading toward another entrance to the mine. The maze-like paths here make it feel like a dungeon, although it’s no different from any other map in the game.

As I head down the straight path, I start to hear loud voices, and eventually I see the distant figures of people… Hmm, I hear a lot of “my liege”s there. It must be Mr. Musasabi’s party.

“Why, if it isn’t the princess! I don’t see you here very often… Oh? Does that yellow marker mean you have servants?”

“Good day. Funny running into you here. These two are with me to help gather materials for new equipment. I believe Mr. Skelly has posted about it on the BBS already, but this is the result of Necromantic Magic.”

“Oh, so you really have become a necromancer, my liege!”

“It’s a complicated thing, and not just anyone can become a necromancer…”

“So it’s out of our reach. Well, let us carry on.”

Mr. Musasabi explains that the plan is to take turns fighting enemies if we run into another party, then split up again once we reach a fork in the road. First-wavers really do seem like a peaceful group.

“A war of words does nothing but waste time. Everyone wants to have fun, do they not? Besides, forks in the road come quickly here!”

This is also a party of top players…meaning that anyone at the top levels really isn’t that different from one another. Their IRL circumstances, be it work or school, will allow for a fixed cycle of play. In other words, you’ll start to find anyone who plays for the same amount of time as you in the same hunting grounds, and you’ll start to develop a relationship with them. It also seems harder to start fights in a game as realistic as FDVR.

“Most of the people in this area are top players, my liege. There’s a high probability that we will be fighting alongside each other in future raids.”

Five enemies appear along the way as we walk and chat. I let the players go ahead to challenge them.

“Of course, my liege.”

“Onward, onward!”

Mr. Musasabi is in a party of six. They’re easy to spot, as they’re all dressed in ninja outfits. I can tell how their friendship started at a glance.

“Hiyaaah!”

“Hiyah! Hiyah!”

So this is what I heard earlier? They scream with every attack. At least you can tell they’re top players by their movements.

“Hacchah!”

“Hiyah!”

They traded places to protect an injured member… They really do know what they’re doing.

“Farewell!”

“Depart, beasts!”

Oh, it’s over? These ninjas aren’t even close to historically accurate. You can tell they’re all slayers.

“Well, I can certainly tell how much fun you’re having.”

“Indeed. It’s incredible.”

“It’s the best of fun, my liege!”

We continue on our path again, only to run into four enemies next: two lancers, one fighter, and one shooter. The Ant Shooter must be the one who shoots poison. I’ll leave the lancers to them and handle the other two.

“Unit One, take out your spear.”

CLACK

I bait the fighter with a Light Lance like before, then shoot a Light Arrow at the shooter to draw its attention. My rapier can’t attack as frequently, but I’ll just have to accept that. I tell my servants to go mess with the lancers.

I’m about to deal with the fighter like before, but the shooter suddenly sends something yellow flying at me. I block it with Royal Counter. I see that the poison is being registered as a long-distance physical attack like an arrow, not a spell.

To be honest, my rapier is more like a shield to me than a weapon. My spells use the tip as a magical catalyst, unless I put in the conscious effort to change that. In other words, if I focus, it doesn’t matter where I point the rapier. I use it to block hits and attack with my spells. This is my combat style—I focus on magic and land a rapier attack only when the opportunity presents itself.

I continue to assault the fighter with Nox Shot and Light Lance while I keep the shooter occupied with my Light Arrow. I can’t let these two high-level enemies focus on my servants, or I’ll lose out on capacity. Since I see them as equal to me, I take on the enemies myself.

My Nox Shot pierces the fighter, leaving me to deal with the shooter. I block the incoming poison volleys, fire off spells, and close the distance between us since my spells work best at close range.

The fighter had the highest stamina of them all, followed by the lancers, then the shooter, whom I finish off in no time at all.

After that, I help Unit Two take out the enemy he was handling, and finally, I get to absorb all four enemies with my ritual.

“Your Parry is most impressive as always, my liege. What is that stylish ritual of yours, exactly?”

“It’s my Dark Ritual. I absorb these to gain capacity, which I use to summon servants.”

“I see… Is this Necromantic Magic? I understand why not all can accomplish it. What becomes of the drops?”

“They despawn, of course.”

“Ah, I see… Although, I hear that ant armor can be used to make light armor.”

“Grr…but I want my capacity…”

Right now, only Unit One is wearing the armor I earned when we defended Starting Town. Unit Two, as well as the future Unit Three, need armor too…

Mr. Musasabi’s party defeats the rest of the approaching enemies, and once we reach a fork a bit further up, it’s time to part ways.

“I’ll be going now.”

“I bid thee farewell!”

I continue on, defeating any ant that crosses my path and gathering whatever ores I can, ending up with copper, iron, nickel, and cobalt. I stopped finding copper once I reached the area where nickel spawned, but most of what I found after that was iron, with only a bit of nickel and cobalt along the way.

It seems like you really do have to go quite deep into the tunnels. The enemies started at level 23 or so, going up to level 26 deeper in.

The middle of the mine shaft was like a giant plaza. It was also a safe area, so I was able to keep mining while also finding time to log out and eat dinner. I came out with large numbers of ore, capacity, and even a few ant materials. It’s still early, but maybe I should go to bed. No, I can’t. I never delivered my potions. I’ll hand them over before going to bed. The event ends today, and since holding on to them won’t do me any good, I can only hope someone will take them off my hands.

 

I warp to Starting Town via portal and decide to go pay Granny Meghan a visit. Since you need permission to sell at her store, I’m not sure if she’ll take them or not, but I suppose it doesn’t hurt to ask. I head straight to her shop.

“Hello. Do you take potions, by any chance?”

“Are those for the new outsiders? Go take them to the pharmacy next to the adventurers’ union,” Granny Meghan answers.

“Now that I think of it, I never even looked into what places sell potions.”

“Well, I know you have no use for them. I’m sure the pharmacy’s dying for the supply, so head on over.”

I leave the store and head to the pharmacy next to the union. It looks like the adventurers’ union has the weapons shop to the left and the pharmacy to the right. I’ve passed by it so many times too, but somehow, I have no memories of the place whatsoever. It must have simply not caught my interest before.

“Good day,” I greet the clerk on duty.

“Welcome. Can I help you find something?”

“No, I’m actually here to give you some potions.”

“Thank you so much! Come right along then.”

To be technical, the pharmacy here is more like a compounding pharmacy. I take in the rows of potions on display, as well as the smell of the place, which reminds me of an IRL hospital. Although, unlike an IRL hospital, there’s also the scent of magical herbs. It’s not the minty freshness you might expect, but more like the scent you get when you grind leaves together.

Well, it doesn’t exactly matter, since it fits the setting so perfectly. I take my potions out of my pouch and place them on the counter. There’re twenty-five HP Potions and 366 Beginner’s HP Potions.

“I actually have leftover bottles too. Do you need them?”

“Certainly, if they’re a quality of C or higher.”

I end up handing over my 297 bottles as well. Even though this was a donation quest, the clerk ends up paying me approximately 17,000 gold for the lot. And to think these were just the byproduct of my attempt to raise my Alchemy skill. I’m happy to see they’ll buy the potions for a slightly lower price than what they would be sold for. I’ll never use any potions for myself, and if anything, I’m glad they’ll stop taking up space in my inventory now.

I think I’ll leave the shop and go to bed now.

Tomorrow is the update patch. The second wave of players is finally joining. As soon as the maintenance is over, I need to go see Mr. Ertz.


# Chapter 3: Update—The Second Wave
 

I DECIDE TO USE the maintenance downtime as an opportunity to spend a few hours doing homework in the morning. Just before lunchtime, Akina shows up to talk to me.

“Sis! An FLFO dev is going to do a livestream this afternoon!”

“What…? During the maintenance?”

“The title is ‘Yamamoto Ittetsu’s Time-Killing Stream.’”

“He said that working things out is his job. Should he really be killing time while on the clock?”

“Who knows?”

I was going to do my homework until the maintenance finished up…but I guess I can watch the stream at the same time.

“We’re live, Mr. Yamamoto.”

“Ah, so I didn’t make it in time?”

Now that it was afternoon, the stream starts up with Mr. Yamamoto eating lunch in the cafeteria.

“Howdy, folks! It’s me, a higher-up!”

“It doesn’t sound like you’re taking this very seriously…”

“But it’s my own personal stream. I’m gonna eat my lunch and talk about the new patch notes, so until then, enjoy watching an old man stuff his face on stream.”

“Did you lose a dare or something?”

Akina and I are also eating our lunches as we watch. Today we made soumen noodles—a nice and easy dish.

“Ooooh, what could it be? Let’s check the notes… They’re adding new daily, weekly, monthly, and biannual quests? Changing the drop rate for meat… Oh, and they’re adding guilds too…”

“There’re new dailies now?”

“It looks like it.”

“I’m curious to see what the new meat drop rates are like.”

It’s the first update since the game was released, so it sounds like it’s going to be a big one, full of things like new items, bug fixes, and changes to mechanics.

Mr. Yamamoto says that he’s eating a katsudon lunch set from the cafeteria. It comes with miso soup and pickled veggies. It certainly sounds like a filling lunch.

“Phew, that was great! All right, shall we get back to the update?”

Now that he’s finished eating, he heads into another room and takes out a controller.

“First of all, the biggest change with this update is the second wave of player sign-ups. The total player count in the game is going from approximately 20,000 to 60,000 players. Next up are the daily quests. We’ll be adding new login bonuses and dailies. The daily quests will offer rewards that you can think of as pocket money, weeklies give consumables that you might enjoy getting, monthlies offer fancier versions of weekly rewards, and biannual quests give you 10 whole SP each!”

So they’re not the kind of login bonuses you have to collect daily or else you lose your login streak—according to Mr. Yamamoto, they come from the total number of daily quests you complete. If you clear half a year’s worth of quests, you’re guaranteed to get the final prize. He says this should be a relief to those of us who can’t play for certain periods of time, like if we have business trips.

“The game does have ‘life’ in the title, after all. Living in that world for half a year should come with some newly learned skills, don’t you think?”

The daily quests are all a little different, so we’ll be able to choose which of the dailies we want to complete each day. This is supposed to prevent those feelings of obligation, like “Aw man, I’ve gotta do my dailies first…”

“Plow X fields.” “Collect X vegetables.” “Create X potions.” “Defeat X monsters.” “Read X books.” There’s going to be all kinds of things like that.

“If you think up any dailies that would really suit your own personal playstyle, try sending them in to the devs. I think you’ll be able to see most of them added to the game.”

The consumables you can choose to receive from the weekly quests are the same gifts I was offered after my bug report…except for the SP. There’s a combat consumables set (potions, etc.), production consumables set (materials, etc.), and a one-hour skill EXP boost ticket (must be used within seven days).

“Oh, about that EXP boost…you’ll be able to raise your first-tier skills a whole lot with that one. For second-tiers, well, it should help a bit? If you’re planning to use it to level third-tiers, you may as well rip it up.”

Potions and materials received will depend on the level of the person claiming them.

Monthly quests will offer money along with the same selections as weekly quests, but with more items included.

By the way, these quest times are determined by IRL time and not the four in-game days that go by during one real day. The quests reset at four in the morning to account for workers who come home late at night or for those who get called away on urgent business.

“Next up… We’re adding a dungeon to Starting Town!”

“No way! A dungeon!”

“Okay, sorry for the exaggeration…but it’s a place that the first wave of players won’t have any need for.”

“Oh… Oh no…”

My sister’s excitement just went out the window. Mr. Yamamoto must be talking about a way to deal with the traffic in town, right?

“We made Starting Town a pretty big place, but since the hunting grounds rely on random spawns, this dungeon will give you whatever you need. Head there if you feel like the hunting grounds are too crowded.”

It sounds like, with no bosses to speak of, it’s really just a simple measure to prevent overcrowding.

The enemies come from the northern mountains, eastern forests, western forests, southern forests, and areas around town. Besides the fact that you can select which enemies you fight, it’s otherwise a normal dungeon in terms of mechanics. Those of us from the first wave are allowed to go test it out, but we won’t get much out of it. It does seem like a way to farm rabbit and wolf meat, though.

The map of the dungeon will change each time you enter. It contains a base level of plains, then caves, and then a forest.

Mr. Yamamoto also says it’s supposed to stay around for a while. I’m sure we’ll be seeing a third wave at some point too.

“Let’s see. Next up…”

He continues to give simple explanations about each new addition while snacking on ice cream and sweets. Since he’s streaming from his personal account, he clearly doesn’t care about putting on a show.

“What else… Ah, how about this? We’re adding a new public board to find people to play with. You can find it behind the Stellura statue in each town’s center, as well as next to the quest board in the adventurers’ union. If you’re interested in full immersion or RP, be sure to check it out. But if you don’t care about that stuff, you can also bring it up in the UI at any point. It’s not easy to get by in an MMO without this sort of thing.”

Now that I’m thinking about it, we’ve always had an official BBS but never a feature for finding parties and such. This should make it easier to find random players to team up with.

“The board will have tags, like for hunting, production, and trading, so don’t forget to use them if you’re looking to join up with people.”

You start the search process by choosing a hunting, production, trade, or skill tag. If you select hunting, you’ll be shown boxes for location, time, level, roles, and comments, which you can fill out as needed.

“The location is to specify which hunting grounds. Time is for how long you want to play, level is for what level range you want to team up with, and comments are a free space to add a message of up to 200 characters. As for role…we made it so you can choose from things like tank, melee, ranged, combat magic, support magic, healing, and performance. I’ll give you an example…”

 

Ex.

Location: North of Starting Town

Time: Until midnight

Level: 10 or higher

Role: Melee, attack magic

Comments: Melee fighters, please use blunt weapons! Any magic attribute is fine!

 

“That’ll do it. By the way, the ‘healing’ label is for people with Holy Magic or those who can throw potions. Though I doubt you’ll find many potion throwers out in the wild.”

Potion throwers…wasn’t there a Pitching system in the game?

“Right, you can get Potion Pitch under Stone Throw. Is that what he means?”

“There’s no point in getting it if you’re on your own. You might as well be throwing your money away.”

“It would be better if there was someone who could return all those materials back to you. A solo player has no hope of making them back up again.”

That’s just the way it’s got to be. I imagine that most people with Potion Pitch who might join a team as a healer are making their own potions, and for that, they’ll need materials.

You have to throw a potion at a teammate to heal them or at an enemy to inflict status ailments on them. It’s a unique combat style. I could see them playing as doctors, alchemists, or maybe even witches, depending on the person.

“Those interested in production can also leave a location, time, level, skill, and comments. The role section is replaced by skills where you can select from Gather, Mine, Logging, and of course, Fishing too.”

 

Ex.

Location: Volcano

Time: Leave at 8 p.m. and finish by midnight

Level: High enough to fight

Roles: Gather, Mine

Comments: “Let’s go mining. Prepare your own heat-resistance measures.” or “Leader has Heat-Resistant Magic.”

 

“By the way, crafting requests fall under trades, not production. Let me explain trade requests. The categories fall under buying, selling, creation, and exchange. Once you choose one, you can fill out each of the boxes.”

 

Ex.

Selling: Iron sword

Asking: 15k

Quality: B

Comments: Secondhand crafted item. Slightly damaged. Contact me on whisper chat.

 

Buying: HP Potions

Offer: See comments

Quality: See comments

Comments: C+=500, B-=600, B=700

 

Creation: Red undergarment

Seeking: Needlework Knowledge

Materials: Bring your own

Reward: Consult

Comments: It’s gotta be red.

 

“As for exchanges, you just tell ’em what you’ve got and what you want for it, then take things to whispers. I guess you can throw in bonuses too, or just let them leave it in the log if you want to go to bed. We’ll also have whisper chat and party request buttons for the shared boards. Feel free to chat with whichever you prefer.”

The price changes based on quality, just like with HP potions, and you can use the comments to specify if you want multiples.

As for why he used red undergarments as an example item…I won’t even bother questioning it. I doubt it has a deep meaning. He probably just thought of it off the top of his head. Those potion prices aren’t accurate to the current game, either.

“As for skills, I honestly don’t know if you guys will use this or not…but maybe it’ll be useful for performers? You choose a skill to raise and search for people who will level up with you or give you a hand. I think performers could use it to find people to help put on a concert. Well, it’s there for you now, so feel free to use it.”

Skills don’t level up unless you use them or participate in some kind of related event. Anyway, I’ll make a mental note of these new recruiting boards.

 

It’s now been almost five hours since the start of the stream. Maintenance should be just about over soon.

“Mr. Yamamoto!”

“What?!”

“Everything’s going according to schedule.”

“All right, then we’ll be back up at 5 p.m. just like we announced.”

“Roger that!”

“Okay, folks. Have you downloaded the patch already? Are you ready to log in? There should be lots of beginner’s equipment coming to Starting Town!”

I bet it’s going to be really crowded for a while. I want to avoid that sort of thing, but I do have business with Mr. Ertz. I won’t be able to escape Eli and Abby’s arrival with the second wave of players, either. I did log out in Starting Town yesterday.

All right, I’ve made some good progress on my homework. I think that’s enough for today. The livestream’s over too, so I’ll go queue up to log in.

 

Standing by to log in. Please wait. You are number 1,052 in line.

 

…Ah, okay. I’ll keep an eye on it and wait for the number to go down. It only takes another minute or so before I manage to log in.

There’s a blinking icon on the right side of my vision. That must be my daily quest. What’s on the menu today? Let’s see… Improve an existing skill, cook any item, use Alchemy to produce an item, harvest a resource… There’s quite a lot.

Combat…production…harvest…other… Oh, there’s a quest for reading a book too. That must be for Language Learning.

All right, I’ll get cooking then. Mr. Ertz isn’t around yet, so I’ll make some jerky and give it to the consignment seller.

As for a smoking liquid… I’ll make a brine by dissolving salt and sugar in water, then soak some wolf meat slices in it. Next up is Fast Reaction…although I don’t have enough MP, apparently. I undo Inventory Expansion, wait for it to recover, and use the spell.

I take the meat out after it’s soaked for two days and remove some of the salt. Then I dry it with Humidity Control and place it in the smoker.

Once it’s ready, I take the meat out and leave it to rest for the day.

Let’s see…I’ll do this over again five more times. One piece of meat makes sixty strips of jerky. One person can stave off hunger with a few strips, so this can probably feed twelve people. Five pieces of meat will make 300 strips.

While I’m waiting for my MP to regenerate, Mr. Ertz logs in. I’ll head to the trade union when I’m done and hand over the jerky, then visit the usual spot.

I receive 1,000 gold for my daily quest reward. That’s really only pocket change. Oh well. I’ll just go to Mr. Ertz’s place.

 

I thank the innkeeper and head outside where I spot a group of people wearing matching outfits. I don’t see anyone with blonde hair drills, so I continue onward to visit Mr. Ertz. I can contact the others IRL when I want to meet them.

I thought it was going to be difficult to walk around town, but people are actually clearing paths for me. That’s very nice of them. I’ll take bold and elegant steps in that case. With that, I arrive at the shop.

“You’re like, what’s that guy’s name? Moses?” jokes Mr. Ertz.

“I was able to get here pretty easily thanks to them doing that. Anyway, I got some ore for you, so I’d like to sell it and have some crafting done too.”

“Oh, I can do that for you. What do you want crafted?”

“A one-handed hammer, one-handed sword, two-handed sword, small shield, and a large shield. Can you do that?”

“That’s a tall order. Is this for your Necromantic Magic?”

“Yes, it is.”

I wonder if they can use bows too. That request would have to go to Ms. Primura, though.

“How much will it cost?”

“Let’s see… If you want the highest quality, it’ll be about 850,000 gold, but if you want them one grade lower, then it’s 600,000. It depends on what you want to sacrifice.”

“Iron is the highest quality?”

“No, that’s steel now. I’m looking for more ways to raise the quality. If you’re fine with C quality, then I have some made already.”

“Hmm… How far have you gotten?”

“I can get up to B at the moment, but if you want a full set, that’ll cost you over a million gold.”

“I can do that. I saved up a lot of gold during the tournament.”

“Ah, I see. All right… I also have one-handed swords, two-handed swords, and large shields that are above a B grade.”

One-handed and two-handed swords are both popular and essential, so he ends up making them a lot. People only buy large shields occasionally. I’ll ask him to contact me whenever he makes the rest of my order at over a B grade.

“I’m finally gonna be able to buy a shop!” said Ertz.

“Oh, it’s about time.”

“A million gold will be plenty for that. What say we settle on that exact amount? That would be…twenty-three one-handed swords, twenty-five two-handed swords and large shields, fifteen small shields, and twelve hammers.”

One-handed weapons are popular, as are two-handed swords, although he needs materials for them. The same goes for large shields. He’s willing to discount the small shields and hammers a bit. It all sounds good to me, so I put in the official request.

Oh, that’s right. I need my dismantling knife repaired, and I need to buy two more pickaxes too. I’ll have Mr. Ertz buy the iron ore and ant drops from my list. That will be a return of 90,000 gold or so.

After that, I go to the union and withdraw my remaining 650,000 gold, then pick up my steel one-handed swords, two-handed swords, large shields, and two steel pickaxes. The weapons cost 730,000 gold, while my repairs and pickaxes cost 4,200 on top of that.

“Thanks a bunch! You’ll have to wait a while longer for the one-handed hammers and small shields. Do you have any preference for the type of hammers?”

“I’m fine with maces. My servants may not be able to use anything too complicated.”

“Simple’s always best. Leave it to me.”

“Oh, that’s right. Do you buy the iron equipment drops from the war?” I asked.

“I do, so I can break them down. The price depends on the piece.”

I have him buy my iron sword, spear, axe, dagger, and greatsword for 9,000 gold, while I keep the mace for myself. I also keep the small shield I bought, since it isn’t iron. I don’t have any substitute for that one yet.

Now it’s time to give my new steel equipment away via Secret Art of Necromancy.

Oh yeah, when you equip items that are too advanced for your stats, there’s supposed to be a bit of a penalty or something. I hope that’s not going to be a problem for my servants.

“I summon you, skeletons.”

It’ll be quicker to just try it out myself.

“Oh, check out the bones,” comments Mr. Ertz.

“Does this new equipment work for you, Unit One?”

The two servants pause for a moment before nodding their heads, so it looks like there’s no trouble. Maybe the penalty doesn’t apply to servants? Or maybe the skills are giving them a boost.

“They say it’s all right.”

“Yeah? That’s great. I still don’t have a good handle on the penalties this stuff will give.”

“Unit Two can use two-handed swords, so I think his stats must be pretty high.”

“A pure magician with no Strength at all won’t be able to raise those stats!”

“He can fight in the second area, so I think he’s stronger than second-wave players, at least? Although I don’t know what’ll happen if someone uses Light Magic against him.”

“Is Necromantic Magic pretty strong?”

“I’m not entirely sure. Some of my own buffs are affecting them.”

I can’t make a solid judgment with nothing to compare it to. Their AI level seems higher than my own base, but that shouldn’t affect their stats at all.

“By the way, if you’ve got any food, c’mon and sell it to me!”

“Um…I do have bear soup,” I answer.

“Yeah? That works for me.”

“How many do you want?”

“Can I have six?”

“Sure thing. That’ll be 800 gold per soup, for 4,800 total.”

“No problem at all.”

I sold most of them off during the tournament, so I’m pretty empty-handed now, but thanks to that, my inventory is pretty free. Though it’s hard to say how open the remaining nine slots really are.

Now…I think I’ll cook. I’ll make some rump steaks and sandwiches. I have baguettes I can cut up for sandwich bread.

“Hey there!”

“Hi.”

“Good day, Ms. Primura.”

Ms. Primura slips through the crowd and starts setting up her stand next to Mr. Ertz. As always, I set up my own cooking set a bit behind them.

I use my Fast Reaction on my baguettes while I grill up the rump steaks. Since I don’t have any lettuce, the sandwich can have cabbage, and I can use roast beef in place of ham. But the roast beef will require the stone oven, so I’ll start with the bread.

The bread is made with my art—starting off with natural yeast to form a dough that I knead, let rest, and repeat to mass produce the bread until my MP runs out.

Once I’m out, I put the dough in the oven and handle the steak next. I cook it with beef fat and garlic, and I make sure it’s grilled well on both sides. Then I pour in brandy to create a flambé. Finally, I extinguish the flames and set it on a plate where I keep it warm, flip the bread over, and get to work on another steak. By the time that one is finished, the bread is ready to come out.

“I haven’t seen such mouth-watering cooking in a week now!”

“No fair! Sell me some steak!”

“Sure, if you want one.”

“Me too!”

“Are they…1,000 gold each?”

“Twelve hundred. The buffs depend on the quality…but please wait just a little longer.”

“Sure thing.”

I grill up another steak and take the bread out of the oven. For now, I’m done with cooking and can sell my products to the two of them.

Oh, they came out with buffs. I collect the bread and note the results. Rump steak, garlic, and brandy results in an increase to Dexterity.

“It’s B+ quality and comes with a Dexterity buff of 5% for five hours. That’ll be 3,000 gold.”

“I’ll take it!”

“I’ll take it!”

“Looks like we’ll have to rely on a dice roll.”

The five-hour time limit is IRL time. One day in the game is six IRL hours, so for those who engage in production, it’s a real treat of a buffed meal.

We roll 1d100 with the winner being whoever gets the higher number. They both pick the dice roll from the menu, select the type, and see the die appear in midair as an item. It’s big enough for a child to carry it in their arms.

“Victory is mine!”

“Victory is mine!”

I wait for their violently thrown die to settle. It looks like dice have no collision detection, so we can’t kick them to change the outcome or something like that. They phase through other players too.

A pop-up display appears above the die once it falls still, as well as above the player who threw it.

“Woo-hooooo!”

“Grrrrrr!”

Looks like Ms. Primura wins.

All right, now I can get back to cooking. The next Dexterity buff I manage to create will go to Mr. Ertz.

I take out my freshly baked baguette and cut into its side to create three even pieces of bread, then I chop the cabbage up into thin strips. I place down a layer of chopped cabbage on the bread, followed by a layer of roast beef. I sprinkle some fried onion slices on top, then pour some gravy over the rest of the fillings…and with that, it’s complete.

Now that I think of it, I haven’t made any deep-fried foods, have I? For a sandwich filling, chicken katsu probably works better than fried chicken. Maybe beef katsu would be good too… I have both flour and potato starch on hand, so I can definitely do that. Honestly, I should probably try making soft bread as well, instead of just the French style.

“Would either of you buy sandwiches if I had some ready?”

“Well, this is a game, so I’d buy them…but wouldn’t combat players appreciate sandwiches more?”

“There were quite a few people who had monsters show up while they were eating, and they got really upset about dropping the food made by the princess.”

“Of course, people told them to just eat in the safe zones…”

“Some were just blinded by the delicious jerky. It’s surprisingly rare.”

That must mean that some people eat with one hand the whole time they’re on hunting trips.

“I remember Cecil having jerky in one hand and a meal in the other. He eats while he takes breaks but also while he’s focused on hunting.”

“Ever since the martial arts tournament, the consignment sellers have had lots of meat. The people from the cooking board were so happy they were finally able to cook it, and after selling meals to people, they had enough money to buy some more food for themselves.”

The chefs must have realized that they could buy meat, cook it up, and sell it for profit once they learned that meat was something people wanted to buy. Thanks to that development, people on the cooking board obtained Fast Reaction and upgraded it to a second-tier skill, allowing their production rates to increase a bit. But it’s probably not any faster because of its MP usage.

They also apparently learned about developing flavors from things like hot dogs, which increase MP consumption…so it’s still going to be a while before they catch up to me.

Anyway, let’s move on to deep-fried foods. Wolf meat… No, the softer rabbit meat will be easier to use. But that’s for later! Right now, I need to focus on baguettes and steaks.

The steaks result in Strength and Dexterity boosts. Sandwiches only give Stamina. Strangely, freshly baked baguettes offer no buffs at all. Maybe they’re too simple? I wonder if croissants give anything. I have butter, so I could try making some now.

I set the topic of croissants aside for the moment and get straight to working on the items I had planned. I end up with fifty steaks and forty baguettes. Next, I lower the heat in my stone oven so I can finish up the roast beef.

 

[COOKING] HANDMADE SANDWICH

Rarity: NO Quality: B

Satiety +30

Bonus effect: Stamina +5%

Time limit: 4 hours 30 minutes

Chef: Anastasia

 

Continuing along with the baguettes I have leftover in my inventory, it comes out to a total of 123 sandwiches. I made a bit too much roast beef, though, and have two leftover helpings. Oh well. I can just keep them on hand.

“If you have anything with Dexterity, then I’ll take another two or three.”

“Me too!”

“Sure thing.”

I end up selling four of each to the both of them. The buff meals come out to a total of 24,000 gold. A delicious profit for me.

“Oh, that’s right. Do you have any bows for beginners, Ms. Primura?”

“Hmm? I only have ones that are one level higher than beginners’ bows.”

“Would it be possible to borrow one?”

“For what?”

“I want my Unit One to carry it and see if he can use it or not.”

“Ah! Your mass-produced skeleton, right? Go ahead!”

“Thank you.”

Mass-produced skeleton…? Well, I’ll ignore that comment. I recall the two servants, who had been out all this time, change up their skills and equipment, and then summon Unit One again.

“Well? Think you can use it?”

CLACK CLACK

No good? I wonder what the issue is.

“You don’t know how to use it?”

CLICK

I see… It’s a stat issue. So if he can use swords and shields like normal, I can safely assume this is a problem with his low AI level? He could probably learn to use a bow if I taught it to him from square one. Yeah, that sounds annoying. I say goodbye to my skeleton archer and return the bow to Ms. Primura.

“It looks like it’s going to be a while before he can use a bow. I don’t have much need for stabbing or long-distance weapons right now, so that’s fine with me.”

“I’m sure it would be hard to get equipment for a humanoid servant…” she comments.

“But there aren’t really any humanoid servants available right now.”

Summoning Spell and Necromantic Magic function differently, so even summoning the same type of skeleton will result in quite a difference. Which is the better skeleton will be based on the person doing the summoning, but for undead, the order of value, from best to worse, goes Secret Art of Necromancy, Necromantic Magic, and Summoning Spell. Any other order would be trouble for us undead.

 

I log out for dinner, eat, take a bath, and then log back into the game.

“You picked the perfect time to come back,” says Mr. Ertz. “I just finished your maces and shields.”

“Oh? You’re done already? I’ll go get my money then.”

“That’ll be 270,000 gold.”

I head to the trade union and retrieve my jerky profits. After the fees, it comes out to a bit over 110,000 gold, so I withdraw enough to cover the rest of the costs. Let’s see…I’ll take 100,000 more gold, so I have 3.4 million gold remaining in the account. Armor is going to deplete that quickly, so I’ll save it for later. I go back to the stand to purchase my items.

“Here you are.”

“Thanks as always!”

I change Unit One’s equipment to a steel mace and large shield. Unit Two can keep his two-handed sword for now, and I’ll also keep Unit One’s previous mace around for him. Yes, this should be perfect.

“Hey there, everyone!”

“Yo!”

“Hey.”

“Good day, Mr. Dentelle.”

Mr. Dentelle sets up his stand opposite of Ms. Primura, on the other side of Mr. Ertz.

At the same time, Ms. Salute, the Compounding user, and Ms. Nephrite, the Handicraft user, arrive next. Ms. Salute sets up next to Ms. Primura, while Ms. Nephrite sets up next to Mr. Dentelle.

The five of them begin to talk about their future shops. It sounds like they ideally want their shops as close to each other as possible.

I wonder what I should busy myself with until it’s time for bed…

“I see Tasha!”

“We finally found you, Tasha!”

Oh, I know those voices… Well, actually, there’re only two people in the world who would be calling me “Tasha.” I turn around and see the two girls, who—wait… Ha ha! Aha ha ha ha!

“Don’t you think it’s rude to laugh when you look at someone’s face?”

“Well, you went a bit overboard, didn’t you? Look at those incredible drills.”

“Aren’t they lovely?”

She tugs at them with her hands, and they immediately bounce back to their perfect drill shapes. Eli’s drills are extremely tightly wound, while Abby’s more subdued drills are more like pigtails that curl up at the ends.

Eli’s hair really does uncoil nicely when tugged. It’s fun to watch them curl back up into the perfect drills each time.

“Tasha! Look at this!”

Abby lifts Eli’s drills with the palms of her hands and sends them bouncing up and down like springs.

“Hee hee hee…”

“This is fun!” Abby exclaims.

“Could you please stop using my hair as your plaything?!”

Abby ignores Eli’s glares and tries to leap forward and hug me…but the game’s unwanted contact defenses send her away. I can tell she’s shocked, so I decide to add her to my whitelist. She lunges at me again, and I stroke her hair while she wraps her arms around me.

“You two are humans, aren’t you, Eli and Letty? Abby and Dorothy are…demons?”

“That’s right. Abby’s going for the angel route and is focusing on Doll Magic.”

“What about you, Eli?”

“I think I’m going to focus on using whips.”

“Is that…because you’re looking for that kind of aesthetic?”

“Exactly.”

“Holding a whip turns you from a young lady into a queen, so you might not want to go with that.”

Letty’s suggestion is ignored with a huff. “How rude.”

Eli’s going to do whatever she makes up her mind about, of course. I’m sure Letty understands that well.

For now, I add all four of them to my friends list.

“Ah, that’s right. You can have these, Eli. Please share them with the others.”

“Potions?”

“They’re garbage.”

“Hey!”

“They’re low-quality garbage from before I raised my skill levels. But they restore more stats than the Beginner’s Potions do, so please use them early in the game. The residents won’t buy them unless they’re quality C or higher, and I can’t use them because of my race. I’ve been wondering what I should do with them.”

Eli hesitated for a moment. “I’m not sure about how you’re phrasing it, but very well. I’ll take them.”

Yay! Free inventory space! My only option until now was to throw them away, but these four will find some use from them. Ah, this is actually the perfect opportunity to show them the stand that’s set up next to me.

“You can ask this man for dresses and maid uniforms. He’s the best needleworker here, although his prices are somewhat high.”

“Oh? Dresses and maid uniforms?” Mr. Dentelle speaks up. “I’ll cut the prices if you model the clothes for me and let me take screenshots. I’ll also pay you if you model some of my other wares too…but I’m getting ahead of myself. Where’s my silk? I know I have some…”

Mr. Dentelle sure jumped on that suggestion. Are dresses and maid uniforms so appealing? We still don’t know what their base materials consist of. I haven’t found any bosses in the second area yet, but the enemies are too strong for me to make any more progress. That will still take some time.

I’ll introduce them to the others here too. I don’t know when these IRL friends of mine will be able to use the shops, however, due to the prices. Just one weapon costs somewhere in the range of 200,000 gold—and that’s not getting into all the pieces of armor and accessories they’ll need.

Well, I fulfilled my role of introducing them, so that’s all I can do right now. The next step is up to them and their wallets.

“By the way, Tasha, do they have tea leaves here?”

“I’ve been quietly looking for them myself, but I haven’t found any yet. I’m sure they exist, since this world has royalty and nobility in it…but it might be more of a problem with the trade routes than anything else.”

“Hmm… Well, our first step should be to familiarize ourselves with the game while we raise our levels, right?”

Right. They’ll never be able to search for tea leaves unless they get that out of the way first.

If only my dress colors were a little nicer, I could go straight to a company myself… Well, that’s one option, at least. For now, I’m ignoring the matter of the missing tea leaves.

We end up chatting all the way up to bedtime. But that sort of thing is fine from time to time. It’s all part of the charm of MMO games.
