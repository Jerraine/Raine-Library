#Prologue
 

MM… Oh, it’s morning? This is the usual time I get up, so I might as well log in for a bit.

I stretch and check to see if I received any messages while I was asleep. All it takes is a glance at the icon to see if it’s flashing, so it’s easy enough to tell.

After that, I’ll give my inventory a check and replace anything I’m running low on…but that probably won’t be necessary.

I think I’ll go for a stroll through town instead.

 

The real-life time in the world influences the in-game time, although it’s not an exact mirror.

I usually wake up at six in the morning. At that point, it’s dawn in the game too, and by 6:30 a.m., the game transitions to the afternoon. Morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime follow a real-world pattern, while only weather is random.

Hmm. It looks like the rain came to pay a visit today… I guess I’ll abandon my plans for a walk and pass the time until school starts. All I have to do at school today is help out with the cleaning before our end-of-term ceremony, so we’ll be done with that by the afternoon.

Dawn in the game comes again at noon. The weather will change then too, so I’ll have to cross my fingers that I come home to sunny skies.

I finish getting ready and start to head to the front door, when…

“We’ll be out on a date today, so take this and buy whatever you want for lunch!”

“What about tonight?”

“I’ll buy you something,” I tell my sister.

“Okay!”

It sounds like Mom and Dad are spending the day on a date. Akina did have Moreburger for lunch yesterday. But what about today? Sushi?

“Conveyor belt sushi? Or the regular kind?”
